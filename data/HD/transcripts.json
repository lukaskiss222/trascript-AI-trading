Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, let me turn the call over to Bob Nardelli. \nBob Nardelli: Thanks, Diane and good morning, everyone. This year was another year of company records, demonstrating that the strategy we laid out five years ago is working, and is delivering profitable growth.  We continued to solidify our leadership position in the markets that we serve. As a result of the hard work and dedication of our associates, we achieved several records for the fourth quarter and year, including: sales, average ticket, gross margin, operating margin and net income.  This success will be shared with our hourly and our non-management eligible associates. We will be distributing $44 million in success-sharing checks to them at the end of this quarter.  For the year, sales were $81.5 billion; $8.4 billion or 11.5% higher than last year. Earnings per share were $2.72, over 20% higher than last year. Now this is the fourth consecutive year of earnings growth in excess of 20%. We continued to return value to our shareholders, and in 2005 we returned approximately 67% of earnings through dividends and share repurchases.  Since the inception of our share repurchase program in late 2002, we've spent $9.7 billion of our $11 billion share repurchase authorization, repurchasing 277 million shares, or over 12% of our outstanding shares. During this same period, we have more than doubled the dividends paid to our shareholders. Last month we announced a 50% increase in our annual dividends to $0.60 per share, which equates to a 20% payout among the best-in-class in retail.  By staying on strategy, we reported exceptional results in 2005, delivering on our commitment to provide sustainable, predictable and profitable growth. Carol Tome will take you through our financial results in more detail later.  Our strategy of enhancing the core is a foundation of our business and our financial results reflect our continued focus on our customers. By consistently listening to our customers and introducing a stream of innovative and distinctive products throughout the store, we reported a record average ticket of almost $58, the highest average annual ticket in our Company's history. Tom Taylor will discuss how we are well-positioned to continue our momentum in 2006, through our exciting assortment of distinctive, innovative and new merchandise.  In 2005, using technology as an enabler, we made significant IT enhancements that allowed us to improve our operational efficiency, drive expense productivity and improve our customer experience. When you add it all up, we spent over $1 billion in technology and infrastructure this year.  I could not be more proud of the accomplishments we've made through initiatives such as the continuation of self-checkout, the completion of our back end automated and re-engineering, or BEAR. The progress with certified auto replenishment and our in-store special order service initiative called SOSE.  Our store operation group continues to focus on putting the customer first. We get quantitative, measurable feedback from 250,000 customers each week and have seen improvements across every key attribute we measure, including: associate engagement, speed of checkout, associate know-how, and the merchandising selection. These voice-of-customer results tell us that our strategy is working.  Our services businesses showed continued growth this year, with sales up 21% and currently represents 5% of our total sales. Throughout the year, we saw strength in installation categories such as: countertops, roofing, gutter, kitchen, windows and HVAC. Services is an important growth business for us and represents $110 billion market opportunity.  As the largest segment of our population -- the baby boomers -- age, we see a definite and growing trend from this group towards more Do-It-For-Me services. To better position us for the continued growth, we launched a dedicated 300-person field organization focused specifically on customer service and installer performance during the fourth quarter.  Our acquisition of Chem-Dry in the fourth quarter provides us with a solid franchise business model. This gives us two clear benefits. We will learn about the franchise approach to home services, which could lend itself to future expansion. In addition, through our Chem-Dry, Home Depot is represented in 10,000 additional homes every day, giving us the ability to expand our offerings to the customers, increasing our market share of services. When this is combined with our 11,000 installs a day, we touch more than 20,000 homes and have a significant opportunity to grow through adjacent products and services. We are now the largest retailer, installer and cleaner of soft flooring in the world.  In 2005 we responded to our changing consumer trends by expanding the assortment in our stores through Home Depot Direct, which allows our customers to shop from the convenience of their homes. In addition, customers can shop through their catalogs like 10 Crescent Lane, Paces Trading Company, that offer an expanded assortment extending what we offer in our stores. While still in a start-up mode, Home Depot Direct has doubled in size over the last year.  The next time you are on our website, I invite you to browse our new interactive appliance, grill and tractor selections. You will see why we are excited about this shopping platform. Last week, we invited customers to participate in selecting one of three different advertisements showing our new tractor line-up. In two days we had 1 million visitors, more visibility than any traditional form of media, demonstrating the power of our brand.  I would now like to turn to Home Depot Supply. This business represents 5% of our total Company sales. In 2005, it experienced triple-digit growth. It's core business posted solid gains and we added to these businesses by completing and integrating 18 acquisitions. The acquisition of National Waterworks and USA Bluebook solidified our positions as the premier provider for water and waste water transmission products and services. Our national water infrastructure is aging rapidly. In fact, based on government and industry estimates, in 15 years more than 50% of our country's water infrastructure will be outdated and will need significant replacement and repair. National Waterworks now has 137 branches in 36 states.  Creative Touch Interiors, a leading design center partner to the home builder, grew significantly through the year and now has 37 branches in 14 states. During the year we expanded our offering to home builders through the acquisition of William Brothers, a leading supplier of lumber and building materials. White Cap expanded its presence through double-digit organic growth and six strategic acquisitions. It now has over 103 locations, nearly doubling its presence in the U.S. since we acquired it in May of 2004. We acquired Contractors' Warehouse, which serves the small professional contractor and repair and remodeler. Contractors' Warehouse is a highly productive format with sales per square foot considerably above the Company average. Contractors' Warehouse has eight locations. As we look across the country, we think there are another 150 to 250 potential locations.  Finally, our pending acquisition of Hughes Supply is truly a defining moment in The Home Depot's history. With Hughes Supply, we'll be positioned as the number one U.S. diversified wholesale distributor, with fiscal 2006 sales approaching $12 billion.  Home Depot Supply will continue to be an important growth driver for us. We will focus on integrating the companies within Home Depot Supply, ensuring we capture the synergies we've identified, and continue to expand using a disciplined approach to develop or to acquire businesses that build off our strength, scale and core competencies. As we grow, we believe each new business has the potential to be a $1 billion plus business. When I reflect on 2005, it's clear that our commitment to creating shareholder value extends into the communities in which we live and work, and is a fundamental core value. I'm proud of the extraordinary efforts we made to look after our customers and our associates in 2005.  Now I would like to say a few words on the Olympics. For Home Depot, these Olympic Games represent the culmination of all the hard work and dedication of our Olympic and Paralympic athletes. We are honored to have 35 Home Depot athletes, more than any other company competing in Torino for Olympic medals. We could not be more proud of the associates and our support as they strive to make their Olympic dreams come true. We would like to congratulate all of those medal winners to date, including Steve Elm, Danielle Goyette, Tricia Dunn-Luoma, Katie King and Jennifer Potter.  So in closing, it's evident that the strategy we laid out five years ago is working. As we enter the next five years we feel confident that we are positioned for predictable, sustainable and profitable growth in support of our 2010 vision. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Taylor. Tom.\nTom Taylor: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everybody. As Bob mentioned, 2005 was a solid year. Our initiatives to create a compelling shopping experience paid off as exhibited by strong growth in the core. In the fourth quarter, we saw strength across the store. Kitchen and bath, including appliances, building materials and paint, were particularly strong.  As Bob mentioned, our average ticket for the quarter and year were Company records. For the year the average ticket was $57.98, representing a 5.6% increase. For the quarter, average ticket was $57.20, a 5.7% increase over the previous year. This was driven by our relentless focus on improving the customer shopping experience through store modernization, the introduction of distinctive and innovative products, and our commitment to provide a value to our customers.  In the fourth quarter, organizational categories are important to our customers. In January, people put away their holiday decorations, so we expanded our storage and organization selection, carrying everything from totes to full closet solutions. For the first time with our home organization, we did an exceptional job of coordinating our consumer advertising, including a fully integrated communications approach that took advantage of heavy Internet use, print and TV during the holiday season. This, combined with in-store information we provided associates, helped drive sales and ensure good customer service.  In Decor our kitchen and countertop business realized double-digit comps in the quarter, as a result of the introduction of our Countertop Solution Center and innovative products, such as Silestone MICROBAN and Silestone leather-look countertops, featuring a number of new colors. The introduction of MICROBAN technology is now incorporated into every Silestone quartz countertop as a value-added feature. MICROBAN's antibacterial protection helps to fight the growth of odors causing bacteria, mold and mildew. The Silestone leather-look countertop offers a unique texture and the feel of fine leather with colors that are inspired by rivers around the world. The Countertop Solution Center is currently in 452 stores and we will continue to roll it out to an additional 250 stores in 2006. In kitchens, Thomasville's new cabinet finish and door styles were popular with our customers. Thomasville's reputation for fine furniture has been incorporated into unique furniture-inspired cabinet designs that are available only at The Home Depot.  Our momentum in appliances continued in the quarter as we gained market share. Our core market share on a 12-month rolling basis grew by 160 basis points to 9.7% for the quarter and we captured the most market share in the period, versus our competitors.  We also saw significant improvement in our close rate compared to other retailers, confirming that our approach of having dedicated staff as well as unique, innovative products is working. We maintained our momentum by continuously introducing new distinctive products, like our GE Smart Dispense dishwasher, which holds an entire bottle of liquid automatic dishwasher detergent, dispensing the right amount based on soil levels. Maytag Ice2O refrigerator, the first French door refrigerator with filtered water and ice on the door. Maytag Blue Metallic laundry set, GE Adora front loaders and our full set of LG appliances. We plan to continue this momentum by listening to our customers and responding to their needs. In professional categories, we saw strength in hardware, electrical, plumbing and builder materials across the country. This is not new. We've seen strength in our professional business throughout the year as a result of some initiatives we implemented in early 2005.  Our professional customers told us they wanted dedicated sales associates and an easier way to order products. We listened and we responded. We set up a process and procedures to improve operations, enhanced our credit and loan services, created a 200-person outside sales force and set up a website to better service our professional customers. As a result of our improved customer service, we are gaining more loyalty, share of wallet and have more satisfied customers. In fact, loyalty in this segment is critical due to the frequency with which our professional customers shop.  In the fourth quarter, we wowed our customers with a number of new and innovative products. Our new line of exclusive 28-volt Makita and 18-volt Makita lithium ion powered tools for the pro and serious Do-It-Yourselfers were a big hit. Customers have responded to the unique features and added functionality. Our Ralph Lauren metallic and suede paint, Bellagio Faux paint and Colores Origenes palette from Behr, featuring over 70 colors have also appealed to our customer base.  Let me give you some examples of other exciting products that we introduced this year. The Ryobi MultiTask laser level, the Ryobi log splitter, RIDGID wet/dry vacs and Pegasus door locks also brought excitement to our stores.  The excitement is going to continue. We believe we've done an excellent job of creating differentiation for Spring. Let me give you some examples. In our garden area, we are going to offer everything from mulch with weed protector to mulch that doesn't fade for a year, to a new exclusive masonry wall block with the look of genuine stack stone at a fraction of the price. We will also have the first ever full sun, full heat Impatiens, that we like to refer to as Sunpatiens; and a new shrub Crape Myrtle series called Razzle Dazzle, which is the perfect size for borders, beds, containers and hanging baskets. You will also see an exclusive premium rose program that will enhance our premium flower line of Viva Plants, featuring bilingual, informative packaging.  In the outdoor power area, we have seen tremendous success with our new expanded tractor offerings. Earlier this month we rolled out our new tractor line-up, including Cub Cadet Series 100, Toros Time Cutters Z Zero Turn, and several other models to augment our John Deere lineup. Now, not only do we have the top brands under one roof, but because we have the most home improvement stores we provide the most convenience to our customers. This makes us the clear destination in power equipment and if people want to shop at home, 90% of our power equipment is available on line at TheHomeDepot.com. To better service our customers, by the end of the first quarter we will have a power equipment specialist in stores available to answer any questions on features and functionalities of all of our power equipment, including tractors and mowers.  Finally, we will continue to expand our assortment of patio furniture, offering fashion-forward styles to suit every customer, from cast aluminum bistro sets to weather-treated teak sets. We plan to roll out a new line-up of outdoor cooking, providing all the functionality of indoor cooking. We will have everything from sleek outdoor kitchens to new grills. Our kitchens are modular, have a stacked-stone look and come with a stainless steel grill and the option of a stainless steel refrigerator. The best part about it is, at The Home Depot you will find that at a compelling value proposition.  In addition to the tremendous line-up of innovative products for Spring, our capital investment into the existing stores will continue to pay dividends for the Company.  As I previously mentioned, our Countertop Solution Center is outperforming our expectations and we will continue to roll it out in 2006. Additionally, because of strong initial results, we are increasing the number of pilot stores for home organization, millwork and our Lighting Cloud. We are testing other initiatives and will continue to explore different concepts as we strive to ensure we are providing innovative products, broadening our assortment, and making the environment easier to shop.  With our lineup of products for the Spring and the introduction of new innovative products, our average ticket momentum will continue and we are sure we will create excitement in our stores for our customers. I would now like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol Tome: Thank you, Tom. Hello, everyone. I am very proud of our 2005 financial performance and add my thanks to all of our orange-blooded associates for delivering on our strategic and operational objectives.  As you heard from Bob and Tom, this was a year of many Company records. In the fourth quarter, our sales grew 15.9% to $19.5 billion. Comp, or same-store sales, for the fourth quarter were 5.5%. We experienced our best retail comp of the year in the fourth quarter, with a retail comp of 4.6%. The remaining 90 basis points of total Company comp growth was contributed by Home Depot Supply. Sales from stores that have been open less than one year and sales from our newly acquired businesses contributed 10.4% to our top-line growth in the fourth quarter. For the year, sales grew by $8.4 billion, or 11.5%, to $81.5 billion. Comp sales for the year were 3.8%, with 80 basis points contributed by Home Depot Supply. Consolidated net income totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter and $5.8 billion for the year. In the fourth quarter, earnings per share increased by 27.7% to $0.60. For the fiscal year, earnings per share were $2.72, a 20.4% increase from 2004.  Gross margin was 33.8% for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 37 basis points from the same period last year; 21 basis points of this decline was due to an increased penetration of Home Depot Supply. As we have told you, today this business has a lower gross margin rate than our retail business. We expect the gross margin rate for Home Depot Supply to increase over time as we utilize our purchasing power to drive synergies throughout the enterprise.  Also contributing to the year-over-year decline was a change in the mix of products sold. Reflecting consumer demand, in the fourth quarter we sold a higher percentage of lower margin categories, like appliances and electrical wire, than we did last year. For the year our gross margin rate was 33.5%, a modest increase of 10 basis points from last year, consistent with our guidance. Going forward, we expect modest gross margin expansion.  During the fourth quarter, we opened 70 net new stores, including 11 stores in Canada and five in Mexico. More than 9% of our store base is now found in Canada and Mexico and we are the market leader in those two countries. This year we added 174 new stores, net of five relocations, and closed 22 stores, bringing the total number of stores at the end of the year to 2,042. Today we own 87% of our stores and believe our real estate ownership strategy is a competitive advantage. As you know, we strategically cannibalize our stores in order to grow market demand and top-line sales. In the fourth quarter, we cannibalized 19.5% of our stores, which had a negative impact on comp of 2.6%. Excluding the impact of cannibalization, comp sales would have been 8.1% for the quarter. For the year, cannibalization negatively impacted comp sales by 1.8%. Excluding the impact of cannibalization, comp sales would have been 5.6% for the year.  For fiscal 2005, customer transactions were $1.3 billion, an increase of 2.7% over the last year. For the fourth quarter, customer transactions increased by 4.1%. For the year, selling square footage was 215 million, a 7% increase from last year. The average square footage per store was 105,000 square feet, down slightly from last year, reflecting the changing mix in our store format as we expand into new geographies and size our stores to meet the needs of the markets. For the fourth quarter, weighted average weekly store sales were $676,000 up 1.3% compared to the same period last year. For fiscal 2005, weighted average weekly store sales were $763,000 flat compared to last year. Sales per square foot were approximately $334 for the quarter, up 2.2% over last year.  In the fourth quarter, our new store productivity was the best it has been since 2001, both from a sales per square foot perspective as well as year-over-year change. In the fourth quarter, sales per square foot for our new stores increased by approximately 7%. For the year, total sales per square foot were $377, up slightly from last year.  In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive expense productivity as total operating expenses decreased 96 basis points from last year to 23.3% of sales. During the quarter, we drove expense leverage in most of our major expense categories and we did that by focusing on productivity, not by sacrificing our commitment to customer service.  As you know, we have been redeploying tasking hours to selling hours and as of the end of fiscal 2005, 81% of our hours were committed to selling activities, as compared to 79% last year.  For the year, total operating expenses as a percent of sales was 22%, a decrease of 55 basis points from last year. Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 10.5% and for fiscal 2005, 11.5%. This is our fifth consecutive year of operating margin expansion.  Our income tax provision rate dropped to 36.4% in the fourth quarter from 37.1% last year. The majority of this reduction was due to the reversal of a $22 million evaluation allowance, as we are now able to recognize a state net operating loss for which no previous benefit had been recorded. For the year, our income tax provision rate was 37.1%. Diluted shares for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2005 were 2.1 billion shares, compared to 2.2 billion shares in both fourth quarter and fiscal 2004. The reduction in outstanding shares is due to our share repurchase program. In 2005, we repurchased 76.5 million shares and cumulatively, since 2002 when the program began, we have repurchased 276.9 million shares and spent $9.7 billion under our $11 billion authorization.  Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the year total inventory was $11.4 billion, an increase of 13.2% from last year. Earlier in the year, we told you that our inventory was growing faster than our sales growth due to our acquisition activity and because we increased our inventory in support of the rebuilding efforts in hurricane-affected areas. We are selling through this inventory and as a result, our year-over-year increase is dropping in line with our sales growth. We look to leverage inventory growth in fiscal 2006. For the year, inventory turns were 4.8X, down slightly from 4.9X last year.  Computed on beginning long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, fiscal 2005 return on invested capital was 22.4%, an increase of 90 basis points from last year. We are a financial powerhouse and are using our strong cash flow to invest in the business and return cash to our shareholders. During the year, the business generated approximately $7 billion of cash and used that cash, coupled with the net proceeds of a $1 billion bond offering, to fund $3.9 billion of capital expenditures, $3 billion of share repurchases, $2.5 billion of acquisitions and $857 million in dividends.  We ended the year with $807 million in cash and short-term investments. As you would expect, we hold cash in short-term investments and operating accounts in the United States, as well as Canada, Mexico and China. For cash management flexibility purposes, we issued $900 million in commercial paper at year end, most of which has since been repaid. As we discussed at our January investor conference, our fiscal 2006 growth guidance is aligned with our 2010 vision to grow ourselves by 9% to 12% and to grow our earnings per share by 10% to 14% on a compounded annual growth rate over the next five years. It now looks like the acquisition of Hughes Supply will close in April. Given that, we believe our 2006 sales will grow in the range of 14% to 17% and our earnings per share will grow in the range of 10% to 14%.  Based on our business momentum, we are highly confident of our ability to deliver upon our growth targets in 2006 and beyond. So thank you for your participation in today's call and, Gwen, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Fassler, Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot. Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. I would like to ask one question and one follow up, of course. I would like to start with the gross margin issue. Ex-supply, margins were down a bit still. I'm curious how different the mix trends were in the fourth quarter versus where they were year-to-date when the core retail business was able to generate gross margin increases? And, whether the inventory reduction might have played a role in some of the gross margin erosion that you saw as well. \nCarol Tome: Matt, good morning and let me respond to your question. The mix change was very considerable. As Tom talked about, we saw a significant increase in market share as it relates to appliance growth. In fact, the comps for appliances in the fourth quarter were 29%. Appliances have a lower margin than our core business, so as you can appreciate, that was dilutive to the gross margin overall. It costs us about 13 basis points of margin dilution in the fourth quarter.  If you compare that to the fourth quarter of 2004, where we had considerable gross margin expansion, 30 basis points of the gross margin expansion a year ago was related to shrink. While we continue to see improvement in shrink, we are anniversaring a pretty big number this year; so we didn't have that expansion this year. \nMatthew Fassler, Goldman Sachs: The appliance comp was an acceleration from what you have done previous?\nCarol Tome: Absolutely. \nMatthew Fassler, Goldman Sachs: Great. My follow-up question relates to traffic. It looks like if you just take your retail comp and you subtract your ticket growth, comp traffic was down only very slightly, which was a big improvement from where you were. I'm curious, given that January was so temperate and the weather was probably a positive for your business overall; whether that contributed inordinately to the traffic trends? Or whether in fact you saw traffic at that level through the quarter? \nBob Nardelli: Matt, this is Bob. I think I would respond two ways. I mean, there's no question, you use the word 'inordinate'. I certainly would not say it was inordinately contributed to the weather. I think we all know in retail that January was the warmest January on record.  I go back to the fundamentals that Tom talked about. If you look at the momentum -- November, December, January -- I think it speaks volumes about what Tom and Carl have done in-store. I think it again supports what Carol said in her closing comments about 2006: that we enter the year with more momentum than we had any previous year. \nMatthew Fassler, Goldman Sachs: Understood. Just to recap, it sounds like the traffic trends -- to the extent that they were better -- were probably better throughout the quarter, not just at the end. \nBob Nardelli: That's a correct statement, Matt.\nMatthew Fassler, Goldman Sachs: Thank you so much. \nBob Nardelli: Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to David Schick with Stifel Nicolaus. \nDavid Schick, Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good morning. \nBob Nardelli: Good morning, David.\nDavid Schick, Stifel Nicolaus: Add my congratulations. I wanted to drill into Matt's second question again. If you are saying that weather was additive but it wasn't the story; traffic was the story and traffic was better throughout the quarter. What can you tell us about what you think traffic should look like for '06 or beyond? You said that you are pleased with, essentially momentum now, but how do you think that plays out for '06? \nBob Nardelli: Let me just again -- I think it would be a misrepresentation to not say retail in general got a lift out of January's warm weather, but I would come back -- and I will ask Tom to comment -- David, let me just say again, as evidenced in the comp numbers for the fourth quarter, the continual flow of new and innovative merchandise, particularly that that is exclusive to the Home Depot, I think -- Tom relative to a merchandising standpoint, Carl, relative to operations -- we are feeling very good about the momentum coming out of '05 and going into '06. Tom, wouldn't you --?\nTom Taylor: I think I would say that certainly we will learn from the things we do that help in driving traffic to our stores and continue to repeat them. As I mentioned in my comments, an important customer to us is the pro customer. We are seeing strength in our pro categories and there is a high-frequency of shop with the pro customers.  We are going to continue our efforts along that line. We have a good, aggressive plan to make sure that we are satisfying our customer to increase their visits to the store. While at the same time, we are going to continue to have differentiation in our stores. We are going to have new products in our stores. We are going to try to create excitement. I think some of what we did in the fourth quarter will, as I mentioned in my comments, I am excited about some of the differentiation we are going to bring in the Spring. We are going to do all we can.\nBob Nardelli: David, I am going to pile on to that because we had the entire senior leadership team walk our outdoor garden, department 28, in one of our stores and that is a new process Tom has introduced. I will tell you, you come away with unbelievable excitement about not only our power line-up, which certainly offers the most commanding brands under one roof -- Tom's comment. But if you look at the line-up of live goods for this year again, and all of the accessories from mulch and playground mulch exclusive to us, we are really looking forward to a good strong summer. We just need the weather to cooperate and we are well prepared. \nDavid Schick, Stifel Nicolaus: Great, well I would follow up -- I guess with Tom. Tom, you talked about power equipment, you were just talking about the live goods and the outdoor kitchen. Could you talk about in the Spring selling season in aggregate -- or even break it down -- should we be looking for average ticket increases for the offerings that you've outlined? \nTom Taylor: Sure. I mean, we are seeing customers step up and buy; take themselves up the ladder in our assortment. I don't see a reason why that wouldn't continue. We are continuing to add higher end products to the stores. We think we should see average ticket growth across the categories you mentioned. We should see average ticket growth continue in growth because we are adding new things.  This modular kitchen that I referenced, it's an inexpensive way for people to have a built-in grill -- a real, built-in, good-looking grill on the outside of their house. That will certainly help our momentum, so I would say that it will continue.\nBob Nardelli: You will see the most commanding line-up of outdoor living that this Company has ever put out there, both in-store and on catalog. \nDavid Schick, Stifel Nicolaus: Do you think average ticket growth will accelerate in '06?\nBob Nardelli: David do you mean, will we continue to get year-over-year improvement as we have over the last few years? \nDavid Schick, Stifel Nicolaus: Would the year-over-year accelerate in what your Spring offering looks like? I'm not asking you to predict what the customer is going to do. Just in terms of what you are putting in front of the customer. \nCarol Tome: David, the average ticket growth as well as the transactions are all implied with the sales growth guidance that we have provided for you for 2006. Which, with Hughes, is to grow our sales by 14% to 17%. So hopefully that will help you build your model. \nDavid Schick, Stifel Nicolaus: Fair enough. Okay, thanks. \nOperator: We will go next to Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank. \nMichael Baker, Deutsche Bank: Thanks. I wanted to touch on The Home Depot Supply business. Carol, you had mentioned that through synergies and the like, you expected to grow margins in those businesses. You have a number of acquisitions that you have made throughout the year and several years ago. So in fact, are you seeing better operating margins already in the businesses that you have acquired and have owned for some time? If so, can you try to quantify that a little bit? \nBob Nardelli: Joe DeAngelo is in the room and Joe I think shared some of that at our recent analyst meeting so let's let Joe reconfirm what basically he laid out there.  Joe DeAngelo Certainly this year our operating margin growth was north of 200 basis points across the board with Home Depot Supply. Every business that we have acquired has grown faster after we've acquired them than before; and, we continue to see operating leverage down through the businesses.  There is not a business that has not enhanced their operating margins since we have acquired them or that have been in our portfolio for a while that we didn't increase this year. We will grow that going forward. \nCarol Tome: If you look at our 2010 vision, slides that are on our website, we actually show the margin growth that we expect in Home Depot Supply.\nMichael Baker, Deutsche Bank: Okay, good, I appreciate that. Thanks for the clarity. The follow-up, just some housekeeping. The $44 million in success sharing, Bob, that you talked about earlier; is that in the fourth quarter earnings already? And then last, that guidance, Carol, that you had touched on, the 10% to 14% in '06. I believe -- and just to confirm -- that excludes share buyback? \nBob Nardelli: The $44 million is in the fourth quarter, to be clear. Again, that goes to recognize the fantastic performance of our hourly associates in the store and our non-eligible managers here at SSE and around the country. We are very proud. We are really pleased to be able to pay out $44 million to the associates that have helped earned the success of this Company. Carol. \nCarol Tome: Regarding the earnings per share growth guidance, it does not include additional share repurchases. \nMichael Baker, Deutsche Bank: Great, thank you very much. \nCarol Tome: You're welcome.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup. \nDeborah Weinswig, Citigroup:\nCarol Tome: Well clearly the benefits of global sourcing will help to drive margin expansion in our retail business. We do have some pressure with an increasing penetration of Home Depot Supply, so it's a balanced view as we look at gross margin going forward. That is why we are saying modest at this point. \nDeborah Weinswig, Citigroup: Okay. In terms of a follow-up, from a technology perspective can you talk about what inning we are in? Especially as it relates to automated replenishment?\nBob Nardelli: Let me do two things. Again, I hate to use the inning example. If I can maybe provide a different perspective, because in a baseball game, 10 innings and it's over.\nDeborah Weinswig, Citigroup: Do a double-header. \nBob Nardelli: That would be better. I think the more we reinvest to digitize our Company, the more benefit that we are seeing. Carol talked about a dramatic shift in selling hours, for example, as we digitized tasking, which allowed Carl to put more on consultative selling. If you just look at kitchens and appliances then you would say that is clearly gaining a return on that investment.  So we will continue to invest. , Bob DeRodes and the team are doing a fabulous job. We talked about continuation of self-checkout; we talked about BEAR, we talked about SOSE and I am going to let Tom talk about CAR because again -- Tom, did you want to cover it? I think we have 20% enrolment. \nTom Taylor: We are at 20% of our product is being replenished automatically, with the goal to get to 50% by the end of the year; 50% of the product will be replenished automatically. \nDeborah Weinswig, Citigroup: Tom, that will be at the end of 2006. What about longer term?\nTom Taylor: We will continue to evaluate it. The goal would be to get as much as we can, certainly there are some commodities, but that will be difficult to do. I can't give you an ending number to that. We hit our first milestone. We want to hit 50% and then we will see where we take it from more. There is no reason that it shouldn't go up more than 50%. \nDeborah Weinswig, Citigroup: Obviously, I think Bob you had spoke about at the analyst meeting how important in-stock position is to the customers. Obviously, this should significantly drive that metric.\nBob Nardelli: I think there are two things: CAR you referenced, clearly will do that. the other bit of technology that Carl and Bob DeRodes put in is our new mobile ordering cart. I spent a good part of a Saturday going through that in-store and I would tell you, the Windows-based technology and our inventory management associates have embraced this technology and are using it.  As a result of that, Carl, you may want to just provide some guidance that we really are seeing an increased benefit from this technology of in-stock and order replenishment. Carl, did you want to --\n Carl Liebert : Hi, Deborah. This is Carl. A couple of things. We talked about Mobile Floor Walk at the analyst conference. It's been a terrific technology for us, because it gave us visibility to inventory that's in the store, that we can make sure it's at the right eye level so the customer can grab it.  We've seen improved metrics for our ability to fill holes on the shelf within 24 hours, to pack down smarter and better; as well as our ability to order products on a much more frequency and use auto-replenishment that Tom talked about. But also to leverage the inventory that we've had in our box to begin with. We are six weeks into using this new tool and we've seen a significant improvement. It is the number one customer satisfaction metric for our customers, in-stock. We are pretty pleased with what we are seeing and we know that's going to continue to drive conversion in our stores. \nDeborah Weinswig, Citigroup: Great. Thank you so much. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Dave Tractor with Banc of America Securities.\nDave Tractor, Banc of America Securities: You talked about 10 Crescent Lane earlier in the beginning of the call as well. Where is the end game there? Or, where do you think that can be? Are we going to start seeing it beyond the New York stores? From a merchandising standpoint, how much of that can be incorporated? \nBob Nardelli: Let me say that I think online has always been a legitimate channel to market, and only within the last probably 12 to 18 months have we really, I think embraced that technology in a meaningful way. If you look at -- and we've talked about 3 million visits a week, again significantly above any traditional media circulation that's out there. The million visitors in two days. We are seeing that business has, as I said, doubled year-over-year. Harvey Seegers is in the room and Harvey can comment on, but we are very pleased with the start-up of both of those catalogs. We will be expanding that not only online, but you certainly have heard from Harvey recently. There have been some articles about how we will expand that in-store. Harvey, did you want to comment at all about that? \nHarvey Seegers: Bob, I would simply mention that 10 Crescent Lane represents the result of market segmentation. In particular, we are going after aspirational merchandise, the high-end customer. We will continue to pursue those market segments in the future. So you will see 10 Crescent Lane become the bigger part of Home Depot Direct and you may see other brands introduced as well. \nBob Nardelli: Tom, did you want to add to that?\nTom Taylor: I just want to comment on New York. I think it's an excellent point. If you look at the Paces Trading Catalog, a lot of the light fixtures that you see there are hanging in the Manhattan stores that you referenced. But as we look at some of our resets and as we are investing capital back in the store, our Lighting Cloud pilot that we have going incorporates a lot of what you see in Manhattan across into other markets. So as we roll that out, you will see the learnings from Paces Trading, the learnings from the Manhattan store with the higher offering of Depot Direct products. \nDave Tractor, Banc of America Securities: Thanks. \n Diane Dayhoff: We have time for one more question. \nOperator: We will take our last question from Alan Rifkin with Lehman Brothers.\n Alan Rifkin, Lehman Brothers : Thank you very much. Just a follow-up question with respect to Home Depot Supply. Now that you have said that you experienced triple-digit growth and that within White Cap you saw double-digit organic growth, I was wondering if maybe you could provide a little bit more color as to how some of the other businesses are doing from an organic perspective?  Joe, I know you mentioned that operating margins are up 200 basis points on The Home Depot Supply business. I'm wondering if you could provide a little bit of color with respect to what types of returns on invested capital you are seeing. Thank you. \nJoe DeAngelo: In terms of the organic growth in aggregate cross Home Depot Supply, we were 20%. But certainly everyone was double-digit growth across the board. Relative to the return on invested capital we ended return on invested capital, including goodwill, at 13%. \nCarol Tome: So that is consistent with what we've been talking to you about, Alan and as we look to the future, we see increasing returns coming off both the Home Depot Supply business as well as the retail business.  Alan Rifkin with Lehman Brothers  Thank you very much. \nBob Nardelli: Thanks, Alan. \n Diane Dayhoff: Well, thank you everyone for joining us and we look forward to talking to you next quarter."}], "2007": [{"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2006, "date": "2007-02-20 14:41:16", "content": "TRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :\nExecutives: Frank Blake - Chairman, CEO   Craig Menear - SVP, Merchandising   Joe DeAngelo - COO, EVP   Carol Tome - CFO, EVP, Corporate Services   Diane Dayhoff - IR \nAnalysts: Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch   Steve Chick \u2013 JP Morgan   Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs   Gary Balter - Credit Suisse   Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group   Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein   Budd Bugatch - Raymond James \nOperator: Good day, everyone.

Today we are going to review the company's fourth quarter financial results and our consolidated financial results for 2006. We will discuss 2007, but only generally. We have our Annual Investor Conference next week, so we will defer a more detailed discussion of 2007 for a few days.  Let me begin with an obvious comment. 2006 was a challenging year for us. For the fourth quarter, consolidated sales were $20 billion, up 4%. For the year, consolidated sales were $91 billion, up 11%. Both sales numbers set records for the company. But for the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.46, down 23.3% from the fourth quarter last year; and for the year, diluted earnings per share were $2.79, up 2.6%. Both of these numbers include the impact of severance expense.  Our retail business had a negative comp of 2.8% for the year and a negative comp of 6.6% for the fourth quarter. This performance reflects two things:  First, we felt the effects of the slowdown in the home improvement and housing markets. Home improvement spending decelerated throughout 2006. Existing home sales fell 8.4% in 2006 and housing starts are more than 25% lower than a year ago.  In addition to a difficult market, we also lost share in some key categories. For the year and for the quarter we grew less than our total market. We may not be able to impact the housing market or general economic conditions, but we know that we can improve our performance relative to our overall market share. That will be a central point of emphasis for us in 2007 and beyond.  Since this is my first earnings call as CEO, I would like to step outside the context of the 2006 results for a minute, and make some broader comments. The Home Depot is a company built on a strong set of core values. Stated briefly, we want to empower our associates to be their best, and we want to provide our customers great products with excellent service. We need to make sure those core values thrive, so that our customers know we are the best place to shop for home improvement products, our associates know we are the best place to work, and our shareholders know we are the best place to invest.  These are simple statements that drive a complex business. We have hundreds of thousands of associates in this company who understand our values, believe our values, and live our values. That is our competitive advantage. We need to unlock that competitive advantage by investing in our retail business.  We accelerated this process in the back half of 2006. Our operating expenses grew faster than sales as we invested in associate hours on the floor of our store, in our store maintenance, and in our merchandising resets. We will continue our investment program in 2007, and we will focus our investments in five key areas:  Associate engagement, having helpful and knowledgeable associates available for our customers;  Shopping environment, having safe, clean and uncluttered stores;  Product excitement, having great values and innovative products;  Product availability, having products that are in-stock, and easy for our customers to find and buy; and,  Own the Pro, becoming the #1 destination for our pro customers.  These are straightforward priorities and a reasonable question would be, haven't you always been working on these, and why should we expect different results going forward? The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part is speed, focus and resource. Next week we will describe for you specifics around each of these priorities, the way we are approaching our decision-making to drive speed and flexibility, the things we are taking off our plate in order to provide focus, and the incremental investments that we are making aligned to each of the priorities.  Speed, flexibility, and entrepreneurial spirit are hallmarks of The Home Depot. Our international strength is an indication of that. In Canada, we had positive comps for the quarter and the year. We ended the year with 155 stores there. Mexico continued to outperform during the quarter, posting strong double-digit comps. That was true for the year as well. Today we have 61 stores in Mexico in 40 cities throughout the country.  In the fourth quarter, we entered China with our acquisition of Home Way. This acquisition provides us an entry point into one of the world's largest and fastest growing home improvement markets estimated at $50 billion. We have a terrific leader in Annette Verschuren, who will be responsible for guiding us to the same number one position in China, that we have achieved in North America. We also have a great local leader in Yves Chen, who spent years in Carrefour, and most recently was the CEO of a Chinese hypermarket company before joining us.  Home Way's approach to the home improvement market was modeled on Home Depot, and we trained most of their management in the mid-1990's. We have a great culture fit with this company, and for the last month we have had their leaders visiting with Annette's team in Canada and with Ricardo Saldivar's team in Mexico. We are not going to drive international expansion just for the sake of top line growth though. Both Annette and Ricardo have built profitable businesses, and we have the same target for China.  Let me now address our supply business, and the reasons for our announcement last week that we are considering strategic alternatives for this business. Joe will go through some of the specifics of Supply's performance in 2006. The business exceeded expectations for the year, despite softness in the residential construction market. It also clearly gained market share in the fourth quarter and throughout the entire year.  Why then would we even consider selling Supply? We are past, present, and future, a retail business. To get the most value for Home Depot as a whole we would need, I believe, to integrate Supply with our retail business. While that integration effort might not be a complete hairball, it is sufficiently difficult to warrant checking -- before we begin -- on whether we can create more shareholder value through other alternatives, such as a sale. Once we integrate the businesses, a subsequent sale is much more difficult. If we can create more shareholder value now, through a sale or other alternative, then that's what we will do. If not, we won't.  Finally, in 2006 we continued to return cash to our shareholders. We spent $6.7 billion to repurchase 174 million shares. Since our share repurchase program began in 2002, we have repurchased 19% of our outstanding shares. Additionally, during the year we paid $1.4 billion in dividends, increasing dividends twice.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Craig, who will share with you our merchandising results. \n Craig Menear:  Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. As Frank said, 2006 was challenging. During the fourth quarter we saw softness across our store. We continued to feel pressure resulting from further housing deceleration, tough year-over-year comparisons, falling commodity prices, and softness in discretionary projects, and certain big ticket spending. As we looked across the country we saw double-digit negative comps in areas most adversely impacted by the housing softness, including Sacramento, Los Angeles, and Miami.  While we reported a negative 6.6% comp in the quarter, four departments -- namely Plumbing, Electrical, Garden, Kitchen and Bath -- were less negative than the company average. Lumber prices are now at 2002 levels. The decrease in lumber prices throughout the quarter resulted in a negative impact to the department sales. For the fourth quarter, lumber price deflation negatively impacted comps by 81 basis points.  We continue to see softness in big-ticket items like special order kitchens, millwork, and flooring. The softness in these big-tickets, coupled with the drop in lumber prices, caused our average ticket to decline by 1.6% in the quarter. For the year however, average ticket of $58.90, up 1.6% driven primarily by gains in appliances.  Our momentum in appliances continued in the quarter. We saw considerable improvement in our market share and draw rates as compared to other retailers. Core market share increased significantly to 10.5% on a rolling 12-month basis as measured in units. Customers continue to respond to our innovative and distinctive products. We had success across all appliances, but particularly in the two fastest-growing appliance categories this year, bottom drawer freezer refrigerators and front load laundry, driven by innovative products from GE, Maytag, and LG.  In the fourth quarter, we took bigger swings in holiday decor and consumer electronics. In holiday, we set an expanded offering which featured broader selections of lights, trees and new merchandise, like ornaments and decorative accessories. We had great execution setting this program, and when the season ended, we cleared the product efficiently and transitioned to our winter storage event. Holiday decor posted strong positive comps for the quarter, and our market share in storage increased significantly year over year.  In the fourth quarter, we went deeper into consumer electronics than our past practices. The financial results with this category were disappointing, as it was a highly competitive environment. So don't expect us to go so deep next year.  We realized the impact of better visual merchandising through our rapid refresh program. In the last half of the year, we completed a rapid refresh initiative, where we reset 100 bays in our Top 540 stores. The average lift for the bays that have been reset is over 3%, compared to the same bays in our control stores. We've seen customer satisfaction scores increase at a faster rate in our reset stores than in the control stores, as measured through our customer surveys.  In January we launched Eco Options, which focuses on products that are energy efficient and environmentally friendly. Our customers have responded positively to our Energy Star appliances, and compact fluorescent light bulbs, which posted double-digit comps in the fourth quarter. Today we carry over 2,500 environmentally friendly products in our stores.  We will also continue our accelerated merchandising resets in 2007. As we head into the spring, I believe we have done a great job of creating product differentiation through an expanded product assortment in grills, patio, and outdoor power equipment. At our Investor Conference, I look forward to sharing with you our merchandising strategy to capture market share and drive sales.  Now I would like the turn the call over to Joe. \n Joe DeAngelo:  Thanks, Craig. For 2007 our company is aligned around our five priorities: associate engagement, product excitement, product availability, shopping experience and Own the Pro. Each priority has a designated executive who is charged with leading the team to achieve our goals in 2007 and beyond. These leaders are world-class talent with deep combined retail experience of over 132 years. Each is focused intensely on leading their cross-functional team to enhance our customers\u2019 experience, and build competitive advantage for a clarity of purpose and speed of execution.  Our speed of decision-making and execution has accelerated dramatically. Additional responsibility has been given to each retail region. We have also created two new regions, to reduce the span of control for our regional managers. This is an important investment, as it allows our leaders to be closer to the customer. Simplification of processes began with our store manager performance screen, where metrics were reduced from 35 data points to eight. Momentum is building and across the business we are driving relentless execution in 2007.  In the back half of the year, we executed on our accelerated retail reinvestment program, including a richer labor standard, additional maintenance and incentive programs for our store associates. While we can't see it yet in the numbers, we think it is paying off based on what our customers are telling us. We hear from over 200,000 customers each week, and based on the voice of the customer survey results, we are seeing improvement in each of our key metrics, including likelihood to recommend, the number one indicator of customer satisfaction.  Now let's turn to Supply. 2006 was a great year for Supply, as we exceeded our financial targets, accelerated our Hughes integration plan, and built a strong foundation for future growth. For the fourth quarter, Supply sales grew by 64% and operating earnings grew by 20%. For the fiscal year 2006, Supply delivered sales growth of 162%, and operating earnings growth of 151%.  Supply's fourth quarter 2006 operating profit was $143 million, with an operating margin of 4.9%. The fourth and first quarters are typically lower operating margin quarters, due to the seasonality of the construction business. For fiscal year 2006, Supply's operating profit was $800 million, delivering an operating margin of 6.6%.  Since we have integrated our Supply businesses, we are now looking at organic growth on a combined basis. Overall organic growth was down 6.9% for the fourth quarter, driven primarily by the soft residential construction market. Despite the difficult environment during the quarter, Supply delivered organic growth rates in excess of the markets in which we participate of 340 basis points. For the year, Supply's organic growth was up 5.6%.  Residential construction dropped off sharply throughout 2006, creating significant pressure on the 40% to 50% of Supply sales in this area. This was partially offset by residential market share gains, a focus on commercial construction execution, and double-digit organic sales growth in our maintenance platform. In the aggregate, we delivered organic growth rates in excess of the markets in which we participate of 790 basis points.  Additionally, we are extremely pleased with the integration of Hughes Supply over the last ten months. The Hughes businesses have been fully integrated into Supply. The Supply team committed to $0.01 of earnings per share accretion in fiscal 2006. As a result of the team's focus and execution, we are well ahead of the integration schedule, and have also outperformed the operating plans, delivering $0.04 per share of earnings accretion.  9,800 associates were welcomed into the Supply family with this acquisition, and I am proud to say, that from day one we have had an aligned sales force which enabled us to continue to accelerate performance with our customers, and correspondingly win in the marketplace. Our momentum is tremendous and it continues to build, as we operate as one team driving customer success and shareholder value.  During the fourth quarter, The Home Depot made two acquisitions that will be integrated into our Waterworks platform. We would like to welcome Heartland Waterworks Supply and Sioux Pipe to the HD Supply family.  Now I would like the turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol Tome:  Thank you, Joe. Hello, everyone. Our total company sales grew by 4% or $776 million to $20.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Of the $776 million in sales growth, $1.1 billion came from our Supply segment, offset by a $360 million decrease in our retail segment. For the year, total company sales grew by $9.3 billion, or 11.4%, to $90.8 billion.  In the fourth quarter, sales in the retail segment were $17.4 billion, a 2% decrease from the same period in 2005. The sales decrease was a result of negative same-store sales of 6.6%, partially offset by the addition of new stores.  Consistent with our guidance, the slowing housing environment, and tough year-over-year comparisons significantly impacted our comp sales. We experienced a negative 6.2% comp in November, a negative 0.7% comp in December, and a negative 11.4% comp in January.  December comps reflect our successful sell-through of our expanded holiday assortment; and while comps were double-digit negative in January, comps thus far in 2007 are running in the negative mid single-digit area.  In the fourth quarter on a comp store basis, customer transactions fell by about 5%, due in part to our self-cannibalization strategy. As a reminder, we strategically cannibalize our stores to take pressure off of high-volume stores, and to support market growth. In the fourth quarter we cannibalized about 13.5% of our stores, which had a negative impact on comps of approximately 1.3%.  For the year, retail sales grew by $2 billion, or 2.6%, to $79 billion. Comp sales for the year were a negative 2.8%, driven by a decline in comp store transactions, offset in part by an increase in our average ticket.  Sales in the Supply segment were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, up 64% over the same period in 2005. As Joe mentioned, we look at sales growth in this segment from an organic and an acquired perspective. Excluding acquired sales, total revenues at Supply declined by 6.9% in the fourth quarter. As Joe stated, the decline in the Supply organic growth rate reflects softness in the residential construction market. It is also important to note that we were up against tough year-over-year comparisons, as last year's fourth quarter organic growth rate was over 20%. For the year, Supply sales grew by $7.5 billion, or 162%, to $12.1 billion.  In the fourth quarter, consolidated gross margin was 32.8%, a decrease of 107 basis points from the same period last year. As previously mentioned, given the growth in our Supply segment, we are experiencing a higher penetration of lower Supply gross margin dollars. In the fourth quarter, 12% of our gross margin dollars came from Supply, as compared to 8% last year. 47 basis points of the consolidated gross margin decline in the fourth quarter was a result of a higher penetration of Supply, as well as a drop in its gross margin, due to a change in the mix of businesses owned.  Supply's gross margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 27%, down 137 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. The remaining 60 basis points of contraction in our consolidated gross margin came from a decline in the retail gross margin. Retail's gross margin in the fourth quarter was 33.6%, down approximately 70 basis points, due primarily to three factors.  First, as Craig mentioned, we had an increased penetration of appliances which have a lower gross margin than the company average.  Second, we experienced wire price deflation, which put pressure on our gross margin rate.  Lastly, as you heard, we took a swing by expanding our assortment in consumer electronics. They became highly promotional during the quarter, and the financial results were very disappointing.  For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 32.8%, a decrease of 73 basis points from last year, reflecting for the most part a higher penetration of Supply's lower gross margin dollars.  In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating expenses increased by 153 basis points, to 24.9% of sales. This increase was due to several factors:  First, in the fourth quarter we recorded $129 million of pretax expense associated with executive severance. This caused 64 basis points of operating expense deleverage.  Second, we stayed true to our accelerated retail reinvestment program, so operating expenses in the retail segment grew faster than sales.  Third, we saw some expense deleverage in Supply.  For the year, consolidated operating expenses increased by 11 basis points, to 22.1% of sales. As a result of our lower gross margin and soft retail sales, operating margin in the retail segment was 9.2% in the fourth quarter, down 171 basis points compared to last year. For fiscal 2006, our retail operating margin was 11.4%, down 34 basis points compared to last year.  In the Supply segment, our fourth quarter operating margin decreased by 181 basis points to 4.9%, in line with our expectations given the change in mix of businesses owned and normal fourth quarter seasonality experienced in the construction and infrastructure businesses. For fiscal 2006, Supply's operating margin decreased by 28 basis points to 6.6%. Supply's operating margin for the year was more than 100 basis points better than its plan.  Consolidated operating margin for the fourth quarter was 7.9%, down 260 basis points from last year, due to the factors I just mentioned. For the year, consolidated operating margin was 10.7%, down 84 basis points from 2005.  Net interest expense was $123 million in the fourth quarter, up $96 million from last year. For the year, net interest expense was $365 million, up $284 million from fiscal 2005. During the year on a net basis, we issued approximately $7.6 billion of debt, which caused our interest expense to increase. Our long-term debt to equity ratio at the end of the fiscal year was approximately 47%, compared to approximately 10% at the end of fiscal 2005.  In the fourth quarter, our income tax provision rate was 37.4%, and for the year was 38.1%.  Consolidated net earnings totaled $925 million for the quarter, a decrease of 28% from the fourth quarter of 2005. For the year, consolidated net earnings totaled $5.8 billion, a decrease of 1.3% from 2005.  Diluted earnings per share decreased by 23% to $0.46 for the quarter, and increased by 2.6% to $2.79 for the year. Executive severance incurred in the fourth quarter cost us $0.04 per share.  Diluted shares for the fourth quarter were 2 billion shares, compared to 2.1 billion shares last year. The reduction in outstanding shares is due to our share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 78 million shares, and cumulatively since 2002 when our share repurchase program began, we have repurchased 451 million shares, and spent $16.4 billion under our $17.5 billion authorization.  Now I would like to share some of our operational metrics. During the fourth quarter we opened 34 new stores, including three locations with ten new stores in Canada and three new stores in Mexico. As we announced in December, we also acquired 12 new stores in China. Approximately 11% of our store base operates in Canada, Mexico and China. Today we own 87% of our retail stores.  In the Supply segment, we lease most of our locations and today we have about 1,000 branches in the United States and Canada.  At the end of the fourth quarter, selling retail square footage was 224 million, a 4.2% increase from last year. The average square footage per store was 105,000 square feet, the same as last year.  Reflecting the sales environment, sales per square foot were approximately $305 for the quarter, down 8.6% from last year, and $358 for the year, down 5.1%.  Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter total inventory was $12.8 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 12.5% from last year. On a per store basis, inventory was flat to last year, and the year-over-year dollar increase was really attributable to Supply. Consolidated inventory turns were 4.7 times, down slightly compared to 2005.  Computed on a beginning long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 20.6%, a decrease of 180 basis points from last year, reflecting our retail operating performance and lower returns in our Supply business, as we are earning back acquisition premiums paid over time.  We ended the quarter with $52.3 billion in assets, including $614 million in cash and short-term investments. This is a reduction of approximately $193 million in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2005, reflecting cash flow generated by the business of approximately $8.1 billion, along with the net proceeds of $7.6 billion from debt financing activities, offset by $4.3 billion paid to acquire new businesses, $3.5 billion of capital expenditures, $6.7 billion paid for share repurchases, and $1.4 billion in dividends paid.  As tough as 2006 was for our retail business, our strong financial condition allowed us to invest in our business and return significant dollars to or shareholders.  We are holding our Investor Conference next week, at which time we will share our outlook and guidance for 2007. We thank you for your participation in today's call. We are now ready for questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch. \n Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch: My question is on Home Depot Supply. I am wondering what companywide initiatives are on hold as you decide the fate of this business. Frank, you mentioned that in the future you might consider integrating retail and supply more aggressively at the store level to better serve your pro customers, so presumably what you decide to do with Home Depot Supply would have some bearing on how you configure and invest in your supply chain. What's in limbo until we get some clarity around the future of Home Depot Supply? \n Frank Blake: You gave one example. We have some cross-selling opportunities that we have been exploring with our stores and with the branches in Home Depot Supply. It is not that we are going to stop what we are now doing there, but obviously we wouldn't roll that out further. Additionally, there were a number of activities that Joe was looking at in terms of how you could drive potential synergies between the orange box and Supply and purchasing pricing, logistics; you go down that list, and those are the kinds of things that we would not be proceeding with as we make this decision. \n Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch: Conceptually, how do you think about evaluating P&L investments in retail in a negative comp environment, since we are still seeing some comps deceleration obviously at a slowing pace, but how do you know whether ore investments you are making are the right investments if you've still got negative double-digit comps in January? \n Frank Blake: That is something we have spent a lot of time on internally. Obviously for you all it is very important, and we will look at market share as a key criteria. How are we doing in our markets? Are we gaining share as we think we should be? We will also look at what our consumers are saying, both our voice of customer and third-party assessments of the consumer experience. \n Diane Dayhoff:  Danielle, this is Diane. Aren't you due like today? \n Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch:  I already had my baby, but thank you for asking. \n Diane Dayhoff:  Congratulations. \n Frank Blake:  That's great. Congratulations. \n Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch:  Thank you. \nOperator:  We will take our next question from Steve Chick - JP Morgan. \n Steve Chick - JP Morgan: Congratulations, Frank. I have two questions. One is related to Supply. The question we get a lot is as of even the first part of the year you are obviously very committed to it, and as you are on this call, but can you discuss a little bit on the background of what kind of discussions occur to really decide looking to evaluate strategic alternatives for the business? Did you say it was organic rate of decline of 6.9% for the quarter? Did I catch that right? \n Frank Blake:  That's correct. \n Steve Chick - JP Morgan: Can you give us a little more color behind the discussions? Did it have to do with the new member of the board and a little pressure on that end, or maybe you could clarify? \n Frank Blake:  I will give you my perspective on this and the discussions that we've had internally. As Joe went through, the Supply business had an exceptional year in 2006 and gained share throughout the fourth quarter, so it had absolutely nothing to do with the performance of the business.  As I stepped into the job, I have a couple of strong points of view in terms of Home Depot and what Home Depot should be for the future. One part of that was it is Home Depot. We are one entity. We are not going to be a conglomerate structure with different business segments. Early on one of the significant organizational moves was taking our online and catalog business which had been a separate business, and say no, that goes to merchandising because it is all part of Home Depot, and it has to be an integrated strategy.  Similarly with Home Depot Supply, as you see one of the first moves was making Joe the Chief Operating Officer across all of Home Depot. The request to Joe was look across the whole company and how would this work? How do we think about this as one entity, and drive an enterprise-wide advantage from the Supply business and the orange box? We got a lot of thoughtful analysis on it. It is something we can do. As I said in the comments though, and Joe and his team did a pretty good analysis on this, it is a fair amount of heavy lifting.  In the scheme of things, given my sense of where we are on retail and the focus needed on retail, I concluded and recommended to our board that the best alternative would be to look at our other options at this point, because once Joe and team are launched down the road of integrating, doing a do-over becomes very hard.  As these things become integrated, and it is very hard to separate them out. That was exactly the thought process. \n Steve Chick - JP Morgan: Is the business per sae integrated where if it were monetized, the idea is that it would sell in its entirety? \n Frank Blake:  We are exploring all alternatives, and as is obvious from my comments, don't assume anything from it. We are just taking this as the natural point in time to say, for me it is, you don't want a foot on the dock and a foot on the boat. Let's figure this out. \n Steve Chick - JP Morgan:  Right. That's fair. On the retail square footage growth rate of 4.2% for the quarter, that was down from 6.3% from the third quarter, and I think a little below maybe what you had guided for the year. I don't think your guidance included China back a year ago. Can we think about that as we look to what you might say next week, and the 400 to 500 new stores targeted for 2010? \n Frank Blake:  No. This was pretty consistent with where we thought it would be. \n Steve Chick - JP Morgan:  That's about 105 new stores up year over year. That's consistent? \n Frank Blake:  Well, we gave a range of here is the number of stores that we are going to be opening, and we are well within that range. Carol, do you want to add some more? \nCarol Tome: Absolutely. A year ago January we said we would open 400 to 500 stores between now and 2010. We are on target to do that, and we will give you more color next week. \nOperator:  We will take our next question from Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs. \n Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs:  Thanks a lot, and, Frank, congratulations, too. I would like to start my first question on following up on a couple of the comments you made about the U.S. versus Mexico and Canada. The first piece of this is, if Mexico is up double-digit and Canada was positive, how much softer than the aggregate number of negative 6.6 was the U.S. on a same-store basis? Was it 100 basis points or so? \n Frank Blake:  That is about right. \n Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: As a follow-up to that, obviously the U.S. has a particularly striking macro slowdown, and also an older store base than you have overseas, but is there anything else about the way those businesses are run culturally, given that they were somewhat removed from the U.S., with different and probably more autonomous leadership, that you think you can claw back to Home Depot U.S. in terms of best practices and lessons learned as you look forward to '07? \n Frank Blake:  That's a good question, Matt, and it is a good observation that both Canada and Mexico have, I would say a more aligned decision-making process and that is clearly going to be a focal point for us in 2007 as we look at the U.S. retail business. Already we are seeing that with Joe and Craig and the division presidents, how we get alignment within the U.S. back to that making things a little simpler, a little faster, just to get everybody on the same page. I think that's an accurate observation. \n Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs:  Just a follow-up on Supply. As you consider what would lead to you sell this business, as you run the numbers and look at the proportion of income that you generate from Supply, and the range of comparable valuations, the high-end to the low end of the range doesn't really make that much of a difference or a dent on Home Depot consolidated EPS. It could be a couple percentage points one way or the other.  Is there anything other than price as you conduct this review that will influence your decision on whether or not to divest the business? \n Frank Blake: As I said in the comments, what will be the driving determinant here is what we think creates shareholder value. There are a number of ways of creating shareholder value. There is the shareholder value created by either holding on to it or selling it, and there is the shareholder value that may be implicit in the additional focus on the retail business. \n Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Thanks so much. \nOperator:  We will take our next question from Gary Balter - Credit Suisse. \n Gary Balter - Credit Suisse:  One reason to go into HD Supply among many others, because there is this view you were maturing out the core. As you think about selling it now, and you go back to the core, what changes from that viewpoint? How do we get growth back in the core? \n Frank Blake:  Thanks, Gary. The way I look at this, my starting point is The Home Depot ought to be growing as the market grows, and then some. That should be our objective as we look at our core business, our retail business. When you think of a market that again we understand 2006, the back half was a tough year for this market.  2007 is going to have challenges with it, but long term, this is a market that people are projecting to grow faster than the retail market generally, pick your number, 3% to 5% growth, and then say a reasonable objective for this business is to be outperforming the market. That is pretty significant growth, and then we would want to drive on top of that EPS growth faster than our sales growth. So that would be the overall growth prospective for Home Depot, and we will give you some more details on that next week. \n Gary Balter - Credit Suisse: If your fifth bullet point is Own the Pro and we have heard for the last few years about the synergies between the Pro business or HD Supply and the retail, why just decide all of a sudden before you even had a chance to test that -- and I heard the whole thing about integrating it -- but why not see what some of the opportunities are before making that brash a decision to explore it? \n Frank Blake: I would say within the orange box itself, we have enormous opportunities to improve our performance with the pro. I will give you one small example of this. We are now using for developing our customer data and an understanding of our customers and getting just some great information from them -- and just take these numbers kind of directionally more than anything else -- 2% of our customers drive nearly 30% of our sales. I am talking retail orange box now. Not surprisingly, that 2% of those what we call our super premium customers tend to be pros. We also have an effort -- again orange-box focus -- to have managed accounts for our best pro accounts, and we have had tremendous success with increasing our customer service and the degree of customer spend within those pro managed accounts.  Then we went through the exercise of, okay, let's do a pairing of the premium, the super premium customers that Dunn Humvee is identifying for us, and what we self-identified through our managed accounts, and it was about a 7% overlap. In other words, out of that universe of just those super premium customers, we were only covering about 7% on our managed accounts. I look at that and I say within the context of that Own the Pro strategy is as true from an orange box perspective as a combined perspective. \n Gary Balter - Credit Suisse:  Thank you. I look forward to seeing you next week. \nOperator:  We will take our next question from Dan Binder - Buckingham Research. \n Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group: We think about integration on different levels, from basic integration of systems and human resources, to more detailed and more comprehensive integration. I am just curious when you talk about Hughes being integrated into Home Depot Supply, how would you characterize that from a merchandising and distribution? One of the potential outcomes is that you don't sell Home Depot Supply. What kind of integration that actually requires, and the cost behind that, based on your estimation if you were to integrate it with the total company? \n Joe DeAngelo: The first question is how integrated do we have Hughes and HD Supply, and that's 100%. The way we look at it, the first thing we do, if we have businesses that are participating in the same vertical, which we had four overlapping verticals with the Hughes business when we did the acquisition, we completely integrate them from a human resources standpoint, from a systems standpoint, from a branch standpoint, so you rationalize the facilities so they truly become one company in total.  That is why you saw that when we report our comps, we weren't reporting businesses we only had a year ago, because of the fact that when we put our facilities maintenance business together, our construction supply business together, our Water Works business together, they truly are only one company. One leader, one organization, one set of systems, one operating process, one set of merchandising inventory and execution.  Also on top of that within HD Supply, what you do is what we have done, is work to be able to make sure that we had consistency across the businesses in terms of payroll systems, human resources, financial systems, supplier data warehouses so you can run that as a combined business unit and get the effectiveness across both specific verticals and across all of the businesses in totality.  Then we step back and look at the Home Depot integration. What that would really require is an organizational integration around the functions. What you do is you take the supply chain leaders we have in Home Depot Supply and the supply chain leaders we have within each of the Home Depot Supply businesses and we would integrate them organizationally into Mark Holyfield's organization. We do the same thing on a sourcing basis, into Craig's Merchandising organization.  So that was the process we were embarking on, to be able to make that operate as an entire enterprise. I think the real defined difference is we had a strategy that was driving businesses, so we did have profit and loss centers of which Home Depot Supply was designed to be a single profit and loss center. The change in strategy of having everything as an enterprise requires you to do the human resources integration and then subsequently all the systems integration associated with it. You get the same warehouse systems, you get the same financial systems, everything would be integrated as an enterprise, which we are in the process of doing on the direct business moving it into Craig's business.  I don't have a number that I can pop out for you, but it is certainly a lot of moving parts, in terms of rationalizing organizations and rationalizing systems and picking a point of convergence, because we are retooling our retail business concurrently. As you rolled out a core retail system, you have to be able to plan when you plugged the wholesale systems into that. \nCarol Tome:  It is Carol. I will jump in, not a lot of incremental cost if we were to integrate the companies, but a lot of heavy lifting as you heard from Joe. \n Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group:  How many integrated verticals do you have within the Home Depot Supply business at this point? \n Joe DeAngelo:  Right now we have ten verticals. \n Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group:  And they are all fully integrated? \n Joe DeAngelo:  Yes, they are. \n Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group: Thanks. \nOperator:  We will take our next question from Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein. \n Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein: First focus back on the retail business for a minute. Carol, maybe if you can give us more detail on the retail gross margins, I think you said appliance penetration, wire price deflation, and then the holiday consumer electronics category. Can you give us some detail on where appliance penetration was, and maybe aggregate that 70 basis points between those three just so we understand the gross margin pressures there? How much of that might have been just markdowns on seasonal goods, and how that relates to the inventory position flat on a per-store basis with sales per store down 6% to 7%? \nCarol Tome:  I would be happy to. As we mentioned, the retail gross margin in the fourth quarter was 33.6%, down approximately 70 basis points, and if you look at the three big drivers of that, appliances was the biggest. It cost us 33 basis points in the quarter. The penetration has increased, last year it was about 3.5%, today it is about 4% of our total sales, so that year-over-year increase, coupled with the appliances were fairly promotional in the fourth quarter. So that year-over-year increase with some promotions cost us about 33 basis points.  Wire price deflation cost us around 16 basis points. The rest was in the consumer electronics bucket. Candidly we didn't make any money on consumer electronics. In fact, we lost money on the sale. We took a swing, we learned a lot, and as Craig said, don't expect us to go so deep next year. \n Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein:  Okay. Then just following up on the inventory. \nCarol Tome:  Yes. Inventory, we are very pleased with the levels of inventory in our stores. Down just slightly on a per-store basis. This is an interesting time of year for us, because we start to build inventory for spring. Despite the softness that we see in the housing market, we do know our business is seasonal, and we are starting to bring in spring products today, so the quality of the inventory inside our stores is very good. \n Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein: Back on the Supply business, clearly a very significant deceleration in organic growth. I know you outperformed your market. Joe, do you have any sense of where the construction supply maybe on the residential side is, given the housing starts numbers that we saw for January, and then what you saw in commercial?  Frank, if you could maybe respond to the criticism that has been said, that you bought, for instance, Hughes when the business had 20% organic growth, and now you are trying to sell it or certainly evaluate alternatives, when the organic growth is down in the negative mid single-digits. How do you respond to the criticism that you bought at the peak and you are selling at the low? \n Frank Blake:  Joe, why don't you take the first part? \n Joe DeAngelo:  I think if you look at the markets we saw a significant deceleration as everyone else did in the U.S. housing starts, so for our year the market that we participated in all-in blended, the U.S. housing starts, plus the heavy construction infrastructure, the maintenance businesses, the markets were down 2.3%. In the fourth quarter, those markets were down 10.3%. You can see that that is a significant slowdown, a big chunk of that residential, but we are also seeing slowdowns in construction going forward.  As we look forward into the year, it looks to be low single-digit down next year versus we were calling it flat to slightly up, so we continue to see a decrease, both on the residential side and on the new construction side out there in the markets, and then it looks like once we get through 2007 is gets to be some normalized markets with 2% or 3% up growth years for the next several years. \n Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. \n Frank Blake:  And on the buy high/sell low discussion, I would say a couple of things. First is I think that does not take into account the dramatic improvements that Joe and his team have made in that business already.  Second as I said, we are looking at strategic alternatives. If it turns out that the path to creating shareholder value is to hold the business, that is what we will do. \n Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. See you next week. \nOperator: We will take our final question from Budd Bugatch - Raymond James. \n Budd Bugatch - Raymond James: Good morning. My congratulations to Frank, as well, and also to Danielle if you are still on the call. A couple of areas. The decelerating comps at retail, could you put a little flavor on that in terms of juxtaposing that versus the market and what you think? I realize 2007 is something you will address in more detail, but maybe conceptually where do you think the year unfolds on a comp basis? \nCarol Tome:  I am happy to jump in on the fourth quarter. As we talked about a negative 6% in November, basically flat in December, and a negative 11% in January, first of all, it is important to think about what we were up against last year. Last year comps in November were close to 7%. December they were 1%, January, 5%. So the easiest comparison year-over-year was in December.  Also the timing of Christmas actually did have an impact on comps between December and January. It was about 100 basis points of comp differential between those months, if Christmas had fallen on a day other than Sunday, so there was a little bit of noise there. The most important thing we think is we came out of January and we are now back into the mid single-digit negative area. It is not a comfortable area to be in, but it is within our expectations, based on what we are seeing in the macro environment. \n Budd Bugatch - Raymond James:  Okay. And outlook as opposed to where do you think, 2007 looks like it is going to be a year of a couple of different dimensions in terms of the way it is going to unfold. Would you agree with that? Would you want to comment on how you look at that? \n Frank Blake:  We will talk about this some more next week, but we anticipate continuing headwinds in 2007. There is a lot of inventory to work through in housing, and I don't know if you look at the back half of '07 we are not terribly optimistic, but we could see things start to improve then, but it is gradual. It is not going to be, in our view, it won't be a dramatic turnaround. \n Budd Bugatch - Raymond James:  Okay. My last question is, Frank, with your speed dictum, and with one foot on the dock and one foot on the boat and you are looking at the strategic alternative, can you kind of frame for us what the speed of that decision is going to be? Obviously you don't want to take a long time to do this now? \n Frank Blake: I will stop making little sound bites. I don't think we want to comment on the timing of the decision. \n Budd Bugatch - Raymond James: Thank you very much. \n Frank Blake:  All right. Thank you all. \n Diane Dayhoff: Thank you. Thanks everybody for joining us. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. \nTRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :\nCompany sponsors its own earnings call transcript:\nCompany sponsors partner's transcript:\nCompany sponsors competitor's transcript:\nIssuer-sponsored research firm sponsors client's transcript:\nInvestment newsletter sponsors transcripts of successful stock picks:\nIR firm sponsors transcript of micro-cap company:\nConsulting company sponsors company's transcript in sector of interest: Your company's name and promotion could have been on this transcript!

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Now, let me turn the call over to Bob Nardelli. \nRobert L. Nardelli: Thanks, Diane. In August, we predicted that the third quarter was going to be soft, and it was actually more challenging than we anticipated. We felt the impact of the U.S. retail home improvement market slowing significantly.  However, during the quarter, we did stay on strategy by accelerating our investment in our core retail business and growing our supply businesses. In the third quarter, consolidated sales were $23 billion. That is up 11% from last year, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.73. That is up 1%, while consolidated net income earnings were $1.5 billion, down 3%.  Carol will walk you through the specifics of the financial results later on.  Our total retail segment grew by 1.1%. The softness in sales was a result of continued deterioration in the U.S. home improvement market. The slowdown accelerated through the quarter and Carol will describe that to you later.  While part of our sales performance is due to the fact that we were lapping really two years of active hurricane seasons, we were with some tough comparisons. We believe that the slowing housing market was really the biggest contributor.  Relative to other players in the home improvement sector, we feel more pressure given the number of stores that we operate in slower housing markets, such as the Northeast, California, and certainly Florida. We saw softness in most categories, but especially in discretionary projects in certain big ticket items, particularly in kitchens, soft flooring, windows and hurricane-related products like generators.  Despite this, during the quarter we did gain market share in some key categories, like tractors, patio furniture, and appliances. We will continue to focus on gaining share in other categories by creating a compelling shopping environment through our accelerated retail investment program.  Despite the negative environment, we are continuing to invest in our merchandising resets, our store appearance, and our associates. By the end of the year, we will have completed Rapid Refresh, resetting 100 bays in over 500 stores. Craig will describe the early indications from these resets, which are positive.  Year over year, we will increase spending on store maintenance and appearance by more than 20%, and Carol will discuss this.  We will complete the rollout of self-checkout in all of our U.S. and Canadian stores by year-end. Our labor staffing model will continue to be richer than it was a year ago, and we recently introduced our Orange Juiced incentive program. This program rewards associates and stores for great customer service. Our Orange Juiced program will pay out $30 million this year alone.  I want to thank our associates for their hard work and focus on taking care of our customers. Every week, we hear from 250,000 customers through our voice of customer survey. We have seen significant improvements in our survey results. Key customer service attributes, including customer engagement, waiting to check out, find and buy, likelihood to recommend, and associate availability were up over last year and showed sequential improvement this quarter. Overall satisfaction with our company, as measured by scores of 9s and 10s, is up over 2004 and 2005 levels.  We are making a lot of investments into our core business, and we did not expect an immediate return, but we do expect that we will see a return over time. We are encouraged with the customer feedback to date.  Now, let\u2019s take a look at other parts of our business.  Mexico had the strongest and very strong performance of any division in the company during the quarter, posting a double-digit comp. As the market leader today, we have 58 stores in Mexico and will end the year with 62 stores.  We had strong sales in Canada, and by year-end we will have 155 stores throughout the country, and we will continue to be the market leader.  Our catalog and Internet business, Home Depot Direct, continues to exceed our expectations and is on the way to becoming a billion-dollar business by the end of this year.  Our services revenue, which is included in the retail segment, grew by over 11% in the quarter to $1 billion. Leading categories included countertops, HVAC, and exterior patio.  Additionally in the quarter, we acquired Jubilee Home Solutions, which is a full service bath remodeling business based in Kansas City, Missouri, and we want to welcome Jubilee associates to the Home Depot family.  Now let\u2019s turn to HD Supply. As you know, our strategy with supply business is to extend the strong relationship with the pro customer who is shopping our stores and accounts for about 30% of our retail sales to date. The combination of over 2,000 stores and over 950 supply branches positions us to serve the pro market better than anyone else.  Now, in the third quarter, sales in our supply segment grew by 159%. While organic growth was up about 7% from last year, supply experienced some deceleration in organic growth from prior quarters due to the slowdown in residential construction. Anticipating this, we focused on driving synergies across all of the supply businesses, shifting our focus from residential to commercial construction, where we continue to see strength.  We are pleased with the integration of Hughes business and we are exceeding our acquisition pro forma and realizing synergies ahead of schedule. For example, by the end of the year, Waterworks, which is the largest business within supply, will be completely integrated under one common operating platform with one common payroll system. Further, the branch network within Waterworks will be fully rationalized.  The Home Depot made three acquisitions that will be integrated into Home Depot Supply. We would like to welcome Grafton Utility Supply, Edson Electric Supply, and the Burrus Contractors Supply into the Home Depot family.  This quarter, we launched the re-branding of all of our HD Supply businesses. The supply businesses will now operate under one brand to unite the various brands that resonates with our diverse customer segment and convey our value proposition and market differentiation is simple but in a compelling way.  Finally, we will continue to return cash to our shareholders. Since 2000, we have more than tripled our annual dividend, increasing it from $0.16 to now $0.60 a year. In addition, since the inception of our share repurchase program in late 2002, we have repurchased approximately 16% of our outstanding shares using about $13.3 billion of our $17.5 billion authorization.  Over the past five years, we have returned about 65% of our cumulative earnings to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase.  Before I turn it over to Craig, I just want to comment on our new organizational structure. It has only been in place 30 days, but I could not be happier with the focus, alignment and speed of decision-making we have gained as a result of de-layering. I have a great and experienced team.  I would like to introduce Craig Menear, our Senior Vice President of Merchandising. For those of you who have not met Craig yet, he is a seasoned merchant with over 25 years of retail experience, and nine of those with The Home Depot. Craig. \nCraig Menear: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Several factors pressured our business during the quarter, including faster-than-expected deceleration in housing, the absence of hurricanes, commodity pricing, and the softness in discretionary projects in some big ticket items.  We saw softness in most departments across the store. Lumber prices are at the lowest level since 2003, which had a negative impact to the department sales. For the third quarter, lumber price deflation negatively impacted comps by 68 basis points.  The lack of hurricanes and a tough year-over-year comparisons resulted in negative comps in hurricane-related products like generators, roofing, flashlights and batteries.  We also saw softness in big ticket items, particularly kitchens, soft flooring, and windows. This affected both our transactions and our average ticket. Average ticket was $58.33, down 1% year over year.  From a merchandising perspective, we remain focused on providing our customers with the best merchandising and a compelling shopping experience. We saw strength in certain repair/remodel categories, and gained market share in key categories.  Our repair/remodel business was driven by enhanced services for the pros, building materials, hand tools, power tool accessories, plumbing tools, wire, conduit, pipes and fittings, all performed well, driven by whole project selling as well as increases in commodity pricing. The pro is an important customer for us. We are always focused on improving our products and services for our pro customers.  We are extremely pleased with the progress we have made with our business toolbox program and the introduction of our co-branded MasterCard, two programs that are available only at The Home Depot.  In addition, in partnership with our suppliers, we introduced a bid room for our larger professional customers being serviced in our stores through our pro desk. This bid room allows us to provide better service and value for our customers.  In the face of a slowing home improvement market, we gained share in key categories, including hand tools and accessories, tractors, patio furniture, hard flooring and appliances. I am going to share with you some market share statistics which all came from an independent third party based on a rolling 12 months.  We saw continued strength in patio furniture during the quarter as a result of our broadened assortment, enhanced quality, and great values through our proprietary Hampton Bay brand. Our patio furniture market share increased 220 basis points to 10.7%.  In hand tools and accessories, we gained share through the introduction of innovative products, including the expanded assortment of proprietary toolsets and Stanley\u2019s FatMax Extreme tool line. Our hand tool and accessories market share increased 60 basis points to 16.2%.  In tractors, we gained share in a shrinking market as a result of our comprehensive line-up of tractors, including John Deere, Cub Cadet, and Toro. We are the only home improvement retailer to carry these three national brands in our stores. Our tractor market share increased 110 basis points to 14.8%.  Our momentum in appliances continued, as we grew market share and hit our highest draw in close rates ever. Core market share increased 110 basis points to 10.3%. Results were driven by our merchandising assortment and our knowledgeable sales associates.  Customers continue to respond to innovative and distinctive products. During the quarter, we rolled out the exclusive Wild Cherry Red LG Steamfresh laundry, with LED displays. We were first to market with a new Maytag Epic front-load laundry pair, and we also introduced the GE Adora appliance suite in a new graphite metallic color, which you will only find at the Home Depot.  We have been challenged all year in flooring, but we are making progress. In the third quarter, we introduced new, fashion-forward merchandise in every category included in hard and soft flooring. In wood and laminate, we introduced new finishes in plank sizes through our Thomasville wood flooring and DuPont Real Touch Elite flooring. As part of our accelerate capital investment in the stores, we will reset ceramic tile in 500 stores and wood and laminate in 1,000 stores by year-end. We are very pleased with the initial results and we have seen market share gains in laminate flooring.  In soft flooring, the introduction of Puresque Carpet, which reduces odors in the home, and Sorona, which offers superior stain resistance, have been well-received by our customers.  We continue to help our customers reduce energy costs inside their homes. As the Energy Star Retailer of the Year, we have a comprehensive program, including clinics that teach our customers how to reduce costs in their homes through the use of energy-efficient products.  In October, which was Energy Awareness Month, we held weekly clinics in each of our stores. We offer over 2,500 energy efficient products, including everything from home sealing products, such as attic insulation, windows and doors, to interior lighting.  This year, we expanded our holiday d\u00e9cor assortment. We have a broader selection of energy-efficient light sets, pre-lit artificial trees, wreaths, garland, silk poinsettias, and other holiday items. We also added new merchandise, like decorative accessories for the home and ornaments.  This year, we set holiday early and we are very pleased with the initial results.  During the quarter, we began implementing our rapid refresh, which resets 100 bays in over 500 of our highest volume stores. Today, we have touched over 30% of the targeted stores and expect to complete the program by year\u2019s end.  While still early, we are very pleased with the initial results. The reset stores\u2019 customer satisfaction scores are increasing at a faster rate than the control stores, as measured through our voice of customers surveys.  In the fourth quarter, we have a number of new products that we will roll out to the stores, geared mostly towards our pro and serious do-it-yourself customers. We will be introducing some new, low maintenance products like new styles of fiberglass doors and composite fencing. The fiberglass doors, by Feather River, come pre-finished, they have the look of real wood, and will not rust, dent, or peel. We will also introduce pre-assembled composite fencing, with the look of real wood that requires no painting or staining.  In the fourth quarter, our exclusive commercial electric brand of recessed cans will have new, unique features that make installation easier and faster for our professional and do-it-yourself customers. These products offer exceptional quality at great value.  Demonstrating our continued commitment to innovation, in the fourth quarter, we will add to our rigid line-up by introducing the first aluminum twin-stack air compressor in the market. It delivers longer lasting reliable performance, has 20% more capacity than comparable units, is lighter, and guaranteed to be corrosion free.  Collectively, my merchandising leadership team has over 300 years of retail experience, of which over half has been at The Home Depot. I am proud to lead this group. It is knowledgeable. It is energized. It is engaged, and we are focused on the basics -- bringing the right merchandise to our stores at the right value.  Now, I would like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol B. Tome: Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our total company sales grew by 11.3%, or $2.3 billion to $23.1 billion in the third quarter. Of the $2.3 billion in sales growth, $217 million came from our retail segment and $2.1 billion came from our supply segment.  In the third quarter, sales in the retail segment were $19.7 billion, a 1.1% increase over the same period in 2005. This sales increase was driven by the addition of new stores.  Against a retail comp of 2.7% in the third quarter of 2005, comp or same-store sales were a negative 5.1% for the third quarter of 2006. At the beginning of the quarter, we expected that softness in the economy would have a negative impact on our business, and we projected that our retail comps would be down slightly. August comps met our expectations at a negative 1%, but comp sales in September and October were much softer, with negative comps of 4.3% and 8.7% respectively. The last two weeks in October were very soft, as we anniversaried last year\u2019s highly successful clearance event, and sales arising from hurricane damage.  As Bob said, the retail home improvement market has slowed significantly. Our transactions grew by 1% in the quarter to 332 million. On a comp store basis, customer transactions fell by about 4%, due in part to our self-cannibalization strategy. As a reminder, we strategically cannibalize our stores to take pressure off of high volume stores and to support market growth.  In the third quarter, we cannibalized about 16% of our stores, which had a negative impact on comps of approximately 1.9%.  Sales in the supply segment were $3.5 billion, up 159% over the same period in 2005. We look at sales growth in this segment from an organic and an acquired perspective. Excluding 2006 acquired sales, total revenues at supply grew by 33% in the third quarter, and for the businesses we owned as of the end of the third quarter last year, the year-over-year organic growth rate was approximately 7%.  The supply organic growth rates, while very good, has decelerated from the first two quarters in the year, due primarily to negative growth in residential construction.  In the third quarter, consolidated gross margin was 32.6%, a decrease of 92 basis points from the same period last year. Given the growth in our supply segment, we are experiencing a higher penetration of lower supply gross margin dollars. In the third quarter, 12% of our gross margin dollars came from supply, as compared to 6% last year. 81 basis points of the consolidated gross margin decline in the third quarter was a result of higher penetration of supply business, as well as a drop in its gross margin rate, due to a change in the mix of businesses owned.  Supply\u2019s gross margin rate was approximately 26.5% in the third quarter, down over 350 basis points from last year.  In the retail segment, the retail gross margin rate dropped 11 basis points to 33.6%, and the year-over-year decline is directly attributable to an increased penetration of appliance sales. As Craig mentioned, we continue to gain share in this key category. The gross margin on appliances is less than 20%, so as it grows, we will experience slight gross margin pressure in the retail business.  In the third quarter, expenses grew faster than sales, and consolidated operating expenses increased by 30 basis points to 21.9% of sales. As Bob mentioned, at the beginning of the quarter, we launched an accelerated reinvestment program in our retail stores. We stayed true to that plan, despite the economic headwinds that came our way.  In the retail segment, our operating margin was 11.4%, down 80 basis points compared to last year, reflecting the lower gross margin I just mentioned, as well as expense deleverage due to soft sales and our accelerated retail reinvestment program. In this segment, we deleveraged expenses by 69 basis points, of which 50 basis points were directly attributable to our richer labor stacking model.  On a personal note, I am really excited to be leading our store operations teams, who are doing a great job. Let me give you some examples.  By the end of the year, we will have remodeled 400 restrooms, re-striped over 1,000 parking lots, painted over 400 storefronts, re-lamped about 300 stores with brighter and energy-efficient lighting, refinished the floors in over 300 stores, and replaced the cashier checkout stands in over 200 of our stores.  This activity, among others, demonstrates our commitment to continually improve the customer shopping experience.  In the supply segment, we leveraged expenses, but our operating margin decreased by 136 basis points to 6.9%, consistent with our expectations, given the change in mix of businesses owned and the integration of Hughes.  Consolidated operating margin for the third quarter was 10.7%, down 122 basis points from the same period last year, reflecting both the sales environment and our evolving business model.  Net interest expense was $92 million in the third quarter, up $71 million from the third quarter last year.  In support of our acquisition and share repurchase activities, our outstanding indebtedness at the end of the third quarter was $5 billion higher than last year, and our long-term debt-to-equity ratio at the third quarter was approximately 24%.  In the third quarter, our income tax provision rate was 37.3%, and for the year, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 38%.  Consolidated net earnings totaled $1.5 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 3.1% from the third quarter of 2005. Diluted earnings per share increased by 1.4% to $0.73 per share.  Diluted shares for the third quarter were 2.05 billion shares, compared to 2.14 billion shares at the end of the third quarter of 2005. The reduction in outstanding shares is due to our share repurchase program. In the third quarter, we repurchased 24 million shares and cumulatively, since 2002 when the program began, we have repurchased 372 million shares and spent $13.3 billion under our $17.5 billion authorization.  Now I would like to share some of our operational metrics.  During the third quarter, we opened 26 new stores, including one relocation, with two new stores in Canada and one new store in Mexico. Approximately 10% of our store base is found in Canada and Mexico. We own 87% of our retail stores. In the supply segment, we lease most of our locations and today, we have over 950 branches in the U.S. and Canada.  At the end of the third quarter, selling retail square footage was 221 million, a 6.3% increase from a year ago. The average square footage per store was 105,000 square feet, same as last year. Retail sales per square foot were approximately $351 for the quarter, down 6.9% from last year. New store productivity was down about 5% from last year, but flat to what we experienced in the third quarter of 2004.  Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, total inventory was $13.7 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 13.9% from last year. Inventory turns were 4.9 times, flat to last year. Of the $1.7 billion increase, $1 billion came from acquired businesses in our supply segment. On a per store basis, inventory was down about 1% from last year.  Computed on beginning long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 22.3%, an increase of 50 basis points from last year.  We ended the quarter with $53 billion in assets, including $617 million in cash and short-term investments. This is a reduction of approximately $190 million in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2005, reflecting cash flow generated by the business of approximately $6.9 billion, along with the net proceeds of $4 billion from financing activities, offset by $4.2 billion paid to acquire new businesses, $3.5 billion paid for share repurchases, $2.5 billion of capital expenditures, and $936 million in dividends paid.  In August, we told you that we thought we would grow our 2006 sales and earnings at the low-end of the guidance we gave in January. Given the current challenging housing environment, we think our comps will be mid-single-digit negative in the fourth quarter.  We are staying true to our strategy of accelerating reinvestment in our retail business, despite the softness in the top-line. As a result, we expect that fourth quarter earnings per share will decline by as much as 12% to 16% from last year.  Based on our performance for the first nine months of the year, and our fourth quarter forecast, we now believe our fiscal 2006 sales will grow by approximately 12% and diluted earnings per share will grow in the 4% to 5% range.  The market is challenging, but we are committed to taking care of our customers and driving operational excellence in both our retail and supply businesses. The Home Depot is using its stellar financial position to invest in the long-term for our customers, our business, and our shareholders.  Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. Bill, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Matthew Fassler, Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot, and good morning. Just a couple of very quick questions. First of all, you guided to just now, Carol, a mid-single-digit negative comp for the fourth quarter, coming off a negative 9 for the month of October, and also going up against a somewhat tougher comp in the fourth quarter, both a one- and a two-year basis. I guess the question is what gives you the conviction to assume some sequential improvement in Q4 numbers from where you were in October?\nCarol B. Tome: Matt, it is a great question. I will tell you for the first three weeks of the fourth quarter, we are seeing improvement from how we exited the third quarter. We have a number of really interesting merchandising things that are happening inside of our stores, particularly as you think about holiday. We have an expanded assortment of holiday hitting our stores now. If you are in the stores, you will see that expanded assortment of holiday, and so based on everything that we are seeing with our current sales trends, the merchandising initiatives we have underway, we are predicting a mid-single-digit negative comp.  From a year-over-year comparison, November is our toughest compare. \nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Not to put too fine a point on it, but is the improvement essentially in line with that guidance for the quarter? In other words, have you improved to the mid-single-digit negative declines?\nCarol B. Tome: We have. \nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Okay, to follow-up on that, is that ticket or traffic driven, in so far as you can tell?\nCarol B. Tome: We are seeing strength in categories we saw weakness in the third quarter. \nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Just to follow-up finally, on the hurricane impact, if you could, now that you know the perspective of a year of distance and having watched the patterns in the hurricane-impacted regions, when do you think you saw the greatest hurricane impact, and how long do you think that lasted? How deep do you think the impact was on your comps last year?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, if we look at the hurricane impact in comps for Q3 last year, we think it was about two points of comp that we did not get this year. \nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Would you say that impact lasted through 4Q, or beyond 4Q? At what point should we stop thinking about that as something that is making your comparisons even tougher?\nCarol B. Tome: Well clearly we saw some of that carry into the fourth quarter. \nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs: And into the early part of this year as well?\nCarol B. Tome: A little bit, yes, absolutely. \nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs: But less so. Okay, thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Budd Bugatch, Raymond James. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Good morning. I just have a couple of questions as well, Could you give us any flavor on where you think gross margins and expenses will be? Carol, you said we obviously have a lot of activity going on, putting more activity in the stores, more effort into the stores. Do we think gross margins still trend negatively and operating expense deleverage as well, obviously with the negative comps?\nCarol B. Tome: Yes, Budd, based on the accelerated investment in our retail stores, as well as an increasing penetration of Home Depot Supply, we are projecting that in the fourth quarter, the gross margin will decline and that we will de-lever expenses. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Bob, could you give us any thought on sales and kind of a longer outlook now, in terms of where you think 2007 and when you will get through some of the housing-related issues? I know that is a tough crystal ball right now, but any overarching help you could give us on that would be appreciated. \nRobert L. Nardelli: I would be happy to share my perspective on this thing. I think I said on the last call that I thought this thing was going to be, certainly was going to be challenging. As I said, it certainly came faster and deeper than we thought.  I still continue to believe that, as Carol has indicated, we will have pressure in the fourth quarter. I think that it will continue throughout all of \u201907. I know there are a lot of points of view out there, but I still think we have deeper to go than we have seen.  If you think about just the loss of jobs in the home improvement market, I mean in the home construction business, it is at unprecedented levels. My 35 years of experience, when I see homebuilders basically writing off earnest money and liquidating land, I just know the ability to remobilize, starting with the purchase of land, getting framing crews, and trimming crews back in line, we are starting to see a lot of that unemployment find its way over to the small repair and remodel contractors in our stores.  I think that Joe DeAngelo, whether it is on the retail side or certainly the wholesale side of residential, is seeing the pressure. I would say we have not -- on the home improvement retail portion of this business, I do not think we have seen bottom yet. I do not see anything that says it is going to get significantly better in \u201907. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: My final question is if that remains the case, how much more are you willing to go and stretch the balance sheet or move the balance sheet, maybe use it to acquire some shares in the marketplace?\nRobert L. Nardelli: Two points, Budd. Certainly as I indicated, we still have a pretty significant outstanding balance of what the board has approved, over $17 billion. I think we have demonstrated over the years and certainly have committed that what you have seen in the past certainly is fair to model going forward. I think our resolve in the third quarter, whether it be on share repurchase or accelerated reinvestment, both on the capital side and the expense side, we have stayed true to our commitments, a pretty exhaustive list Carol shared with just store appearance and enhancing the shopping environment.  We are blessed to have a great balance sheet and we certainly would use that as one of our competitive advantages. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Thank you, and I would agree with what you are doing on this, on those scores. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Horvers, Bear Stearns.\nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Good morning. Joe, I was wondering if you could perhaps bucket the supply business. You talked about -- Carol mentioned that water is the biggest piece of it. Could you bucket it between water, MRO, and then residential, housing related businesses, and how the organic growth in those businesses trended in the current quarter?\nJoe DeAngelo: I will take you through just what the portfolio configuration is. We look at it in terms of the way the cycle of execution goes, so if you look at our infrastructure businesses, water and utilities, they make up 36% of our portfolio. You look at all the construction businesses, anywhere from the construction supply businesses to the plumbing, electrical, and interiors businesses, they make up 43% of our portfolio. Maintenance is 16%, which is our facilities maintenance business and our industrial PVF business, and then repair and remodel and international make up the balance of 6% of the businesses.  When you look at the overall portfolio in aggregate, we have about 20% of the portfolio that is directly home building, residential, the lumber and building materials business and the interiors business. When you look at in aggregate about 43% of our business is residential construction, so we have a good mix of businesses in there.  I think the strength of the portfolio is exactly that, having a diversified portfolio allows us to see what is happening throughout every cycle and we can adjust to it as it happens. Then, I think in every case we have been able to be very successful in terms of gaining share.  I will just give you one example. If you look year over year in our lumber and building materials business that operated out of Georgia, this is just the Williams Brothers business, since that is the only one we have owned year over year, we were down about 2%. That is in a marketplace where the prices have dropped for structural lumber, about 24% and panels have dropped about 48%, so incredible pricing pressure, and it is a marketplace where housing starts have been down. So you combine those two and to be only down 2%, I think is significant job of gaining share as you go throughout that.  We have ups and downs throughout the portfolio, but in every case, we are growing faster in the markets we are participating in. \nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: So would you say that the supply business and the multi-family MRO showed growth in the quarter? Does supply include -- didn\u2019t you acquire National Waterworks last September?\nJoe DeAngelo: Yes, we did, so if you look at the multi-family business, the multi-family business was up strong double digits, which tends to run counter-cyclical to the residential construction, so homes are not being built and people will be moving into apartments. Consistently, we have been able to execute well there, as well as across the portfolio. We only had one month of Waterworks, and it was a flat execution this year because we had incredible comps relative to PVC commodity increases, and we did have a lot of hurricane growth in there, so the business again took share in that marketplace. \nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard, Cleveland Research. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Good morning. Two things. First of all, in terms of inventory management, can you talk a little bit about where you think you are and what you are trying to do at the retail level? Also, how promotional you in the market might become in 4Q in this softer environment?\nRobert L. Nardelli: Carol, why don\u2019t you handle the inventory?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, we have a number of things underway from an inventory management perspective, Eric, as you know, from how we order inventory to how we receive inventory and to how we ship inventory from our suppliers.  From an ordering perspective, today about 26% of the inventory is ordered off of our centralized auto-replenishment program. The rest is either ordered from the host here at the store support center or through our inventory management associates. We will continue to add products to our centralized auto-replenishment program over time.  From a receiving perspective, we re-engineered the back-end, introduced our automated receiving process last year, and that is helping drive productivity on the back-end, allowing us to put hours on the floor of the store for selling.  Then, from a supply chain perspective, we are delighted to have Mark Holifield on board with us. Mark is working through his plans for 2007. Right now, there is a lot of blocking and tackling going on from a supply chain perspective, but I think over time you will see some changes in our supply chain. When we are ready to talk to you about that, we will.  Now, from a promotional perspective, I will turn it over to Craig. \nCraig Menear: Eric, when we look at our promotional strategy in the fourth quarter, we are really looking to stay on our strategy. We are focused on making sure we are trying to provide compelling, attractive values to our customer across our entire line segments, and then we, as always, will continue to match and deal with any competitive offers that come up in the marketplace. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Does that mean the promotions on a year-over-year basis, up, flat, down? Do you have a sense of that?\nCarol B. Tome: For the fourth quarter, or in the third quarter?\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: For the fourth quarter, how you are thinking about it at this point. \nRobert L. Nardelli: Eric, it is hard to predict at this point. We certainly, as Craig said, have a strategy, but obviously we will have to be responsive to what is occurring in the marketplace. I think the focus on this thing has really been to provide, and where we have gained share, great value, great pricing, you know, everyday low pricing has continued to be one of our mainstays, so it is not our intention to go out and be overly promotional, but we also will not be put at a disadvantage. \nCarol B. Tome: If I could just jump in to give you some color for the third quarter, we use our private label credit card as a promotional tour because our customers love it. The penetration of the private label credit card was 28.5% in the third quarter, and our everyday value proposition is no interest, no payment if you spend $299 on the card. From time to time, we offer 12 months no interest, no payment programs. In the third quarter, we had four more days of credit offering than we did a year ago, so it was not a significant change. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Bob, one question for you, as you think about the \u201907 sales environment. Could you talk about how you are thinking about capital investment within the business, including the number of stores you are thinking about opening in the softer 2007 you described?\nRobert L. Nardelli: Yes, well, I would say, Eric, we are obviously in the process of putting together our cap-ex plan for \u201907, but as I indicated to Budd earlier, I would not see us coming off the strategy of continuing to invest, particularly in our core business. As you know, Eric, we did take, over the last couple of years, our new store growth from -- let me use a round number, around 200 down to 100. We said at the last analyst conference that would kind of be the range we would use over the next three, four, five years. At this point, I do not see a change, number one, in that.  Two, I would tell you that we will continue -- of our capital plan, continue to spend a significant portion on reinvesting in the core. The resets that we see going on today certainly give us confidence that we will be accelerating that in \u201907. We will be looking at the next 100 bays in mass, but we have continual resets going on. For example, we are very encouraged with the laminate performance that Craig talked about. It is, on flooring, it is the fastest growing segment over soft.  We have introduced a new large tile set. We are very excited about that. We are excited about the success we are seeing with a capital investment in our mezzanines to expand our appliance showroom capabilities.  I think, Eric, what you would see is a continuation of those capital investments that enhance the customer experience, expand the sales per square foot in the store, as really the driving force in \u201907. \nCarol B. Tome: If I could just jump in, we are also looking at continuing our investment in technology. We have a big technology budget, as you know, and that will be increasing in 2007, as well as supply chain.  So for modeling purposes, while we have not finalized our numbers yet, you should expect that capital will increase. This year, we are spending $3.8 billion. Next year, we are going to spend a bit more. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Perfect. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Rowen, Prudential. \nMark Rowen - Prudential Equity Group: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. Following up on the pricing question, given the severity of the downturn in the market, I am surprised that either you or your competitors are not lowering prices to try to stimulate sales. Could you just give us a sense of whether you think that will need to be done as we go maybe deeper into the downturn?\nRobert L. Nardelli: Let me just say this, Mark, obviously pricing discussions are probably out of bounds for the call here. I would tell you that Craig and the merchants are doing a great job in working with our suppliers.  Our suppliers, I could not be more appreciative of the partnering that is going on with them. Craig talked about lumber pricing. We are certainly seeing it in some of the other building commodities, so our position would be to make sure that we are priced sharply to the market, that we are working with our suppliers, and as prices and commodity costs fluctuate, we are making sure we are passing those on to our customers to maintain that brand loyalty and shopping experience.  Craig, I do not know if you want to comment anything more than that. \nCraig Menear: No, and in total, Bob, we are constantly looking at market pricing across the country to make sure that we are competitive every day. We will continue to do that and really focus on driving the best value for our customer every day. \nMark Rowen - Prudential Equity Group: Okay, and then on the rapid reset program, you said that your customer satisfaction scores were way up in the stores that you had implemented it in. Could you give us a sense of any movement on sales, or any improvement in sales in those stores?\nRobert L. Nardelli: Mark, I think two points, just to be real clear. What we talked about is that overall customer satisfaction, or voice of customer, as we call it, is up across the entire network of stores, and that is the 250,000 customer shopping experiences, that they go online and call and score us on associate availability, ability to find and buy, et cetera. We have seen a sequential improvement month over month in the third quarter for sure, and we would expect the same thing to continue in the fourth quarter. In other words, the customers that are scoring us 9s and 10s.  That is one point, and let\u2019s set that aside for the moment, and then I would let Craig talk about specifically what we are seeing early on in the resets, the 100 bay resets in the 500 stores. \nCraig Menear: Mark, as you look at the customer satisfaction scores, while as Bob mentioned they are up across the board, in the stores that we are going in in these categories and resetting, we are seeing those scores outpace the total. Likewise, when we look at the overall performance, as I mentioned, we are pleased with the results that we are seeing with the sales performance of the rest stores in comparison to the control stores. \nCarol B. Tome: I think it is important to note we are seeing a lift in those categories that we are touching. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Gary Balter, Credit Suisse. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Thank you. Just a few questions. First of all, strategically, it sounds like you are moving in a direction that makes a lot of sense, but how do you measure whether you are actually gaining or losing market share versus your competitors? \nRobert L. Nardelli: Gary, as you know, we use external data. There is an outside firm that a number of us contribute to. We are able to get that data on a quarterly basis, that looks at the various classes within our departments. For example, we can look at flooring. We can look at interior paint, et cetera, et cetera. So Craig and the merchants, along with the rest of us, look at that data, look at market expansion, look at our growth relative to that, and we are able to determine share gain or share loss. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: And is your sense that you are holding on to your share?\nRobert L. Nardelli: Well, as we said, in some cases, as Craig mentioned, we have seen share gain. For example, in the categories he mentioned like outdoor patio, tractors, appliances, and in some cases, Gary, as we have said over the last couple of calls, we certainly are not pleased with soft flooring. While getting better, it is still not where we want to be, and clearly that would represent a share loss. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Could you talk about the strategy to carry televisions? You are getting bigger in consumer electronics for this Christmas. \nRobert L. Nardelli: Sure, but I will let Craig handle that, but again, let me just be clear to you and everyone on the phone here. We really see this as an in-and-out, and opportunistic. We know that it is a highly sought after commodity, particularly in the holiday season, since again a couple of holiday events throughout the year. Therefore, we want to go out. We have the strength of our buying power. We are able to purchase right. We pass those great purchasing values on, whether it be on Black Friday and the Thanksgiving holidays, and so our strategy at this point is kind of an in-and-out on consumer electronics, particularly the flat panel plasma TVs and consumer electronics. Craig, do you want to add anything to that?\nCraig Menear: No, Bob, I think that pretty much describes it. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Do you worry, Craig or Bob, on the returns? Costco, for example, which has been big in this category and has been hurt a lot by the returns. \nRobert L. Nardelli: Again, to date, Gary, we have not seen that as a problem, again because of the quantities certainly are not of the order of magnitude of someone that is in consumer electronics as a mainstay, so we bring them in on container loads. We distribute those. We pass on great purchasing opportunities to our customers, and we are kind of in and out.  At this point, Gary, I can tell you we have not seen returns as an issue for us. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Colin McGranahan, Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: Good morning. First, as a follow-up for Joe. Joe, you talked about the deceleration in organic growth in supply, and pointed to the slowdown in residential construction as we would expect. It looks like in the second quarter, it was about 12% organic growth, down to 7%, so a 5% decline. I think you said that residential construction is maybe 20% of the business today. Am I thinking about that correctly, which would imply about a 25% drop in your aggregate residential construction businesses, or roughly in line with what we are seeing in the overall home building marketplace?\nJoe DeAngelo: No, that is not the correct math. The correct math is that 43% of our business model is residential construction related, 20% is direct residential, meaning that is all they do is residential. So the lumber business and the interiors business is 100%, and combined, they are about 20% of the portfolio, 100% residential. But if you look at all the pieces across the construction, the waterworks, the utilities, they all have a residential component. You aggregate all that, it is about 43% for the portfolio in total. \nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: Okay, so that would then say it is down more like 5% to 10%?\nJoe DeAngelo: That is right. \nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: Okay, so Whitecap has a pretty good chunk of residential construction in its business?\nJoe DeAngelo: That is correct. When you look at our mix, we are in the great high growth markets. The high growth markets cooled down significantly faster than everything else, so you see a disproportionate touch on that, but Whitecap, for example, year over year, was down about 2%, of which they were probably down 7% or 8% residential, but picking it up in construction to bring it up to the negative 2. \nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: Okay, and then just on the commercial construction, the non-res, obviously there is multi-family and then there is true commercial. I think McGraw or Dodge reports predicted some deceleration in the commercial construction in \u201907. How should we be thinking about the organic growth rate of that business going forward?\nJoe DeAngelo: I think when you look at it, we have another couple of weeks before we get the quarterly data. We would be better positioned to give you a clean look at that. We are working from the data that is about 90 days old. We look to still see that as a growth market in the six-ish range, so when you blend the businesses together, it is almost a flat outlook for the markets for HD Supply in aggregate going to the next year. Obviously we will have organic growth because we will gain share. \nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: Right, okay. Second question for Carol, how much of the incremental store reinvestment have you been able to offset from expense control elsewhere? Then, if you could just talk about on a year-over-year basis what labor hours per store look like in the third quarter and what you are modeling for the fourth quarter. \nCarol B. Tome: We were able to offset some of the accelerated reinvestment due to some actions that we took here at the store support center, but as we mentioned, in the third quarter, we de-leveraged expenses in total in the retail segment by 69 basis points. From an hours perspective, our labor staffing model is richer in the third quarter than it was last year and than we planned. As we look to the fourth quarter, the labor standards staffing model will also be richer than last year and what we planned.  It is important to note, however, that we do not have a flat staffing model. We have a highly engineered staffing model that allots hours based on tasking and selling activities inside a store. I will tell you, this is highly engineered. The hours that are being allotted to each store today is based on the activities that are happening inside the store today, and there is variability.  When I look at it in total, the staffing model and the staffing standard is richer in the fourth quarter. \nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: Okay, and then just final quick question for Craig. This was the first quarter we saw average ticket decline in I think something close to four years. How should we think about the positive drivers of that, mix-up on merchandise, growth of appliances faster than the overall business, success with installed sales and broadening of your capabilities there, against what was obviously a period of extraordinarily strong major project selling. So how do you think about the cyclical versus the structural drivers of average ticket?\nCraig Menear: I think when we look at the business, we saw strength in repair/remodel categories, which certainly allow us to drive some project selling, but when you look at the weakness in flooring, for example, which is a big ticket project, and kitchens, as we mentioned, those were certainly categories that were a detractor to our average ticket.  When we look at the expansion of things like our holiday assortment, as we look at that through the fourth quarter, that would actually be a driver that could potentially bring average ticket down compared to the total, with the price points that are offered to that product category. \nCarol B. Tome: Let me just give you some data for the third quarter. This might be helpful. The average ticket was down $0.59. If you back out the benefit of appliances, the average ticket was down $0.94. So in other words, appliances contributed $0.35 of growth year over year.  So if you look at the average ticket down, excluding appliances, as Craig pointed out, it is really big ticket related. It is lumber price deflation. Hopefully that helps you understand the composition of average ticket and where it might go. \nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: Craig, it sounds like you just need to attach a 42-inch plasma to every ticket, and you will be set. \nCraig Menear: We did not buy that many. \nRobert L. Nardelli: No, we did not. \nDiane Dayhoff: Bill, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: That question comes from Danielle Fox, Merrill Lynch.\nDanielle E. Fox - Merrill Lynch: Thanks, good morning. I am wondering how you are thinking about your long-term growth targets for 2010 that you laid out at the analysts meeting earlier in the year. Bob, are you expecting lower lows and higher highs based on what you are seeing, or have you changed your view of the earnings potential of the business?\nRobert L. Nardelli: I think two things, Danielle. Obviously given the re-profile we just did for the third quarter, fourth quarter, and therefore the full year, we are going to take a really hard look at \u201907, and then we will take a look at, as Budd and some of the other folks asked me about the recovery, we are going to really take a hard look at that, and then we are going to be in a position, I think we have a meeting coming up at the beginning of the year where we will want to sit with all of you, as we do annually, at the investors conference. We will be in a position then to talk a little bit more about certainly \u201907, \u201908, \u201909, and then impact on the 2010 guidance.  I think you would agree that given the environment, and certainly what we are experiencing here today, we would have to change the profile of that, certainly the starting point where we are exiting \u201906, the impact on \u201907, and then the slope or the curve for 2010.  What I would like to do, if it is okay, is ask you to give us a chance to digest this, take a look at it, review it internally, and then we will be in a much better position to give you a thoughtful, informed decision on that guidance. \nDanielle E. Fox - Merrill Lynch: That sounds fair. Thank you very much. \nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2006, "date": "2006-08-15 14:31:24", "content": "Executives: Robert L.

Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Now, let me turn the call over to Bob Nardelli.\nRobert L. Nardelli : Thanks, Diane. In the second quarter, we delivered sales of $26 billion, up almost 17% from last year. Our net earnings were $1.9 billion, and excluding a one-time tax assessment, diluted earnings per share were $0.93, an increase of over 13%.  During the quarter, we continued our focus on returning value to our shareholders. In May, as you recall, the board approved the repurchase of $2 billion, or approximately $53 million shares, through an accelerated share repurchase program. Since the inception of our buyback program in late 2002, we have repurchased almost 350 million, or approximately 17% of our outstanding shares.  In addition, since 2000, we have more than doubled our annual dividend, increasing it from $0.16 to now $0.60 a year.  Over the past five years, we have returned 65% of cumulative earnings to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. Carol will take you through our financial results in more detail later.  Our retail segment grew by 5%, with an operating margin of close to 13%. In the second quarter, we continued introducing new and innovative merchandise and gained market share in key categories, including appliances, grills, patio furniture, and outdoor power.  Our services revenue, which is included in the retail segment, grew by almost 10% in the quarter to $1 billion. Our Home Depot Direct business, representing e-commerce and catalogues, experienced solid growth and is on track to deliver $1 billion in annual sales.  In the second quarter, sales in our Home Depot Supply segment grew by 325% and the operating margin in that business was 7.5%, up from the 7.2% last year. Our integration of Hughes Supply is exceeding our expectations. Over the last few months, Home Depot Supply acquired four additional companies, and we would like to welcome Western Fasteners, Texas Contractors Supply, Rice Planter Carpets, and Forest Product Supply into the Home Depot family.  Let me now shift to the macro-economic environment. As you know, we use an econometric model for planning purposes, and the economic indicators that drive growth in our industry are mixed. Some indicators like unemployment and wages remain healthy. Also, the installed base for homes has grown over the last three years, and housing continues to age, which benefits home repair and maintenance spending. In fact, we believe discretionary dollars will become repair and maintenance dollars.  On the other hand, the consumers feeling the pressure of higher oil and gas prices, rising interest rates, possible rate mortgage resets, and this pressure on the consumer impacts our transaction count. Therefore, we see a challenging second half and we are planning conservatively overall, but not in the retail business. We are accelerating investments to aggressively focus on our valued customers and attempt to gain share in a down market.  First, in May, we told you that we were going to reset 100 bays in each of our top 500 volume stores by year-end. Today, we are excited to announce that we have added the 40 stores here in our hometown of Atlanta. I have walked the first reset stores and really liked what I have seen.  This aggressive refreshening will become part of our ongoing retail model to the balance of this year and beyond. Further, as you will hear from Tom Taylor, the financial results of the resets have been positive. Tom will also talk to you about our merchandising initiatives later in the call.  Second, we are accelerating capital expenditures on our store modernization program. This includes the completion of self-check-out in all stores, customer service call boxes to selected stores, and just simply spending more on store appearance to improve the overall shopping experience.  Third, typically we adjust our staffing levels to match sales -- up in the spring, down in the fall. For the back-half of the year, we are going to keep the staffing level in place and will be adding more. In total, the U.S. stores will have 5.5 million more hours in our stores to serve our customers. You will see more associates in the store than prior fall seasons.  Finally, in floors, we are continuing with our technology and the logistics initiatives, SOSI, special order service initiative, should be in the flooring department in all of our U.S. stores by the first quarter of next year. Our core retail initiative is moving forward in Canada before we bring it to the U.S.  Additionally, I am delighted to have Mark Holifield on staff as our new Senior Vice President of Logistics. Mark brings 29 years of logistics experience to the Home Depot. In just a few weeks with us, he has already brought some great ideas.  Finally, last quarter we launched a new associate initiative program, raising the awareness and rewarding good customer services. We call that Orange Juiced. Orange Juiced will pay out $30 million to our store associates on top of our success sharing program, so I want to thank our associates for their hard work and focus on taking care of our customers. We are clearly seeing the results on our current voice of customer data.  In total, we are spending about $350 million more in capital expenses than we had planned. In order to do this, we have reprioritized some non-customer facing initiatives. We are confident of our competitive position, both in the retail business and in Home Depot Supply, and in a challenging environment like this, we believe it is all about investing to win.  In the back half of the year, we are investing in our customers, our associates, and our stores, and I am confident in our team\u2019s ability to execute.  So now, I would like to turn the call over to Tom to give you an update. \nThomas V. Taylor : Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We entered the second quarter with momentum. From a merchandising perspective, we saw solid average ticket growth. Our average ticket reached $59.98, a 4.2% increase compared to the same period last year. The growth in average ticket was driven by continued strength in our repair/remodel businesses, as well as market share gains in key categories.  While we had great merchandise momentum, our transaction softened up in the last part of the quarter, and we think it was a function in part of the economy. Let me get back to merchandising.  We saw strength in our repair/remodel business, particularly in building materials, hand tools and power tool accessories, and electrical products, such as wire, conduit and fittings. These categories all reported positive comps, driven by whole project selling, as well as increases in commodity prices.  We also gained market share in key categories, including electrical, hand tools, hardware, outdoor power equipment, grills, patio furniture, and appliances.  In electrical, we gained share due to our ability to maintain a strong, in-stock position compared to other regional competitors. In outdoor power equipment, we gained share in a shrinking market as a result of our comprehensive line-up of mowers and tractors. According to an independent third-party, on a rolling 12-month basis, our core lawn power equipment market share increased 60 basis points to 24.4%. Our results were driven by a stronger merchandising assortment and the power equipment specialists on the floor of our stores.  We have become the destination for grills and patio furniture. Two years ago, we had a limited assortment of grills and a 14.4% market share. Today, we have an expansive assortment of grills and have increased our market share by over 300 basis points to 17.5%.  Patio furniture had another great quarter, as we continue to increase our assortment, enhance the quality and provide great values through our proprietary Hampton Bay brand.  The momentum in appliances continued as we grew market share and hit our highest close rate ever. According to an independent third party, on a rolling 12-month basis, our core market share increased 130 basis points to 10.1%. Our results were driven by a merchandising assortment and our knowledgeable sales associates.  Our customers continued to respond to our new and innovative products. During the second quarter, we rolled up the midnight blue LG steam sense laundry with LCD display. We also introduced an LG French door bottom out refrigerator with ice, crushed ice, and a water dispenser. In small appliances, we added a new and exclusive vacuum line by Maytag.  Given the heat across the country, we saw strength in our air movement categories. We had strong sell-through in air condition units, portable fans, air filters, and evaporative coolers, and saw customers trade up in this category to optimize product efficiency and reduce energy costs.  During the second quarter, lumber prices fell to 2002 levels and had a negative impact for the category. Had lumber prices been at last year\u2019s retail price, our retail comps would have been slightly positive.  In the first quarter, we told you we saw softness in flooring. It did not get much better in the second quarter, but we are making progress. As we begin the third quarter, we are introducing new fashion floor merchandise in every category, including hard flooring, ceramic tile, and soft flooring.  For example, we are expanding our hard flooring assortment to include Thomasville wood flooring, DuPont Real Touch Elite flooring, pre-sealed natural stone, and a Lorel vinyl flooring that has the look of real wood but the resilience of vinyl. As part of our accelerated capital investment in the stores, we will reset ceramic tile in over 500 of our stores.  In soft flooring, we are introducing our exclusive line of [Pruess] Carpet that is specifically designed to resist stains and reduce odor in your home. We are also adding five new products to he Sorona Carpet line, which offers superior stain resistance.  In addition to the merchandise, we have a number of other flooring initiatives underway, from staffing to shortening the installation cycle time to clarifying our pricing proposition -- all of which will turn this very important category around.  Bob talked about mixed signals in the economy. As we look to the back half of the year, we know from our past experiences that in times like these, our customers spend money on core repair and maintenance projects. Knowing that, we will be prepared to serve that customer.  At the beginning of this year, we had a number of merchandising resets underway. Last quarter, we mentioned that we are increasing the reset activity. In over 500 of our highest volume stores, we will reset approximately 100 bays in each of those stores by year-end. These 100 bays include key repair and remodel categories. We call this program Rapid Refresh. We have reset six pilot stores and are very pleased with their initial results. The 100 reset bays are outperforming the same 100 bays in our control stores.  In the third and fourth quarters, we have a number of new programs and products that we will roll out into the stores. We plan to help our customers reduce their energy costs inside their home. As the Energy Star retailer of the year, we have a comprehensive program, including clinics that will teach our customers how to reduce costs in their homes by using energy efficient products.  We will hold clinics in our stores throughout October promoting awareness of our Energy Star products. These products include everything from lighting and ceiling fans, windows and doors, weather stripping, caulk and installation, and appliances. In fact, we have almost 2500 approved Energy Star products in our stores.  In power, we will continue to expand our assortment through the addition of more lithium-ion power tools through Rigid. We carry the most comprehensive assortment in the home improvement industry. New to lithium-ion products from DeWalt, Rigid, and Bosch were added to complement the Milwaukee, Mikita, and Skil products that were introduced last fall.  We will also add seven new products to our exclusive Ryobi One Plus family, increasing the number of tools that can be operated through the Ryobi 18-volt platform to more than 30 tools.  In appliances, you will see us expand the LG Steam Sense laundry line and introduce the LG giant washer and dryer, and the Maytag Duet front-load washers and dryers.  In paint, building on the momentum from our top-rated Behr paint products, we are introducing new Behr kitchen and bath and exterior paints. These exterior paints utilize Behr\u2019s exclusive nano-guard technology, providing improved durability, color retention, wash ability, and mildew resistance. These paints also eliminate the need for a primer and can be used over bare metals.  Our proprietary brand of Behr paints differentiates us as we continue to deliver value to our customers through quality, innovation, and service. I am excited about the initiatives and product introductions that we are planning to roll out from now until the end of this year. We understand the challenges ahead and from a merchandising perspective, we are prepared.  Now, I would like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol B. Tome : Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, in the second quarter, our total company sales grew by 16.7%, or $3.7 billion, to $26 billion.  Of the $3.7 billion in sales growth, $1.1 billion came from our retail segment, and $2.6 billion came from our supply segment. In the second quarter, sales in the retail segment were $22.6 billion, a 5.1% increase over the same period in 2005. This sales increase was driven by the addition of new stores.  Beginning this quarter, we are returning to our historical practice of providing a comparable store sales for the retail segment. Against a strong retail comp of 3.4% in the second quarter of 2005, comp or same-stores sales were a negative 0.2% for the second quarter of 2006. This is slightly down from our first quarter comp, which was a positive 0.2%.  The second quarter started off strong and our May comp sales were in line with our expectations. June softened up a bit, and in July, our comps fell slightly negative.  One last comment about comp sales -- as you know, we strategically cannibalize our stores to take pressure off of high-volume stores and to support market growth. In the second quarter, we cannibalized about 18% of our stores, which had a negative impact on comp sales of approximately 2.1%.  We saw strong growth within our supply segment. Sales in the supply segment were $3.5 billion, up 325% over the same period in 2005. We look at sales growth in this segment from an organic and an acquired perspective. Excluding 2006 acquired sales, total revenues at Home Depot Supply grew by 126% in the second quarter, and for the businesses we owned as of the end of the second quarter last year, the year-over-year organic growth rates was approximately 12%.  Another way we look at the performance and the underlying health of recently acquired businesses is to analyze each acquisition on a full-year basis. For example, while we did not own Hughes in 2005, year over year, Hughes had organic growth of 14%. This illustrates our success in buying quality companies with strong growth potential.  Consolidated net earnings totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, an increase of 5.3% over the second quarter of 2005. Reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, diluted earnings per share increased by 9.8% to $0.90 per share.  During the second quarter, Quebec passed legislation that retroactively changed the tax laws and as such, subjected us to additional tax and interest. As a result, we received an assessment from Quebec for the 2002 through 2005 taxable years of approximately $69 million. The earnings per share impact of this assessment in the second quarter was $0.03 per share. Excluding this discreet item, our diluted earnings per share was $0.93, up 13.4% from last year.  In the second quarter, consolidated gross margin was 32.2%, a decrease of 102 basis points from the same period last year. Our consolidated gross margin rate reflects our evolving business model. As you know, supply has a lower gross margin rate than retail. Given the growth in our supply segments, we are experiencing a higher penetration of lower supply gross margin rate dollars.  In the second quarter last year, 4% of our gross margin dollars came from our supply segment. In the second quarter this year, 11% of our gross margin dollars came from supply. In the second quarter, supply\u2019s gross margin rate was approximately 26.5%.  A higher penetration of lower gross margin dollars, coupled with a slight decline in the retail gross margin, caused total gross margin compression in the quarter.  The retail gross margin rate dropped 26 basis points to 33%, reflecting a changing mix of products sold due to growth in appliances. Appliances are now our largest category class.  In the second quarter, we continued to drive expense productivity, as total operating expenses decreased 48 basis points to 20% of sales. This leverage was not at the expense of store labor.  In the second quarter, payroll, which is our biggest expense in the retail stores, increased by 6.2%. Further, our stores and store associates received $10 million in incentives in the second quarter, directly related to improvement in customer service ratings.  Our ability to leverage total company expenses in the second quarter was due to the strong sales growth in supply, as well as continued benefit arising from safety programs and other initiatives inside the retail business.  In the retail segment, our operating margin was 12.9%, about flat to last year, reflecting slight gross margin compression and expense leverage. In the supply segment, our operating margin grew by 34 basis points to 7.5%, reflecting continued progress in achieving acquisition synergies as we leveraged the power of our combined businesses.  Consolidated operating margin for the second quarter was 12.2%, down 54 basis points from the same period last year, reflecting our evolving business model.  Net interest expense was $98 million in the second quarter, up $78 million from the second quarter last year due to interest associated with $1 billion of term debt issued in August 2005, and $4 billion of term debt issued in March of this year, as well as interest related to the Quebec tax assessment.  In the second quarter, our income tax provision rate increased to 39.6% from 37.4% last year, resulting primarily from the Quebec tax assessment.  For the year, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 38%.  Diluted shares for the second quarter were 2.07 billion shares, compared to 2.15 billion shares at the end of the second quarter of 2005. The reduction in outstanding shares is due to our share repurchase program.  In the second quarter, we repurchased 58 million shares, shares repurchased under our accelerated share repurchase program and cumulatively, since 2002, when the program began, we have repurchased 349 million shares and spent $12.5 billion under our $14 billion authorization.  Now, I would like to share some of our operational metrics. During the second quarter, we opened 30 new stores, including two relocations, with two new stores in Canada and one new store in Mexico. Approximately 10% of our store base is found in Canada and Mexico, and we are the market leader in those two countries.  Today, we own 87% of our retail stores.  In the supply segment, we lease most of our locations and today, we have over 900 locations in 44 states and in Canada. In Atlanta alone, when you combine our retail and our supply businesses, we have over 90 locations, and the served market has grown from $4 billion to now $16 billion.  At the end of the second quarter, selling retail square footage was $219 million, a 6.3% increase from a year ago. The average square footage per store was 105,000 square feet, the same as last year. Retail sales per square foot were approximately $411 for the quarter, down 2.3% from last year. Sales per square foot in our new stores increased. They increased by 1.3% and it was the highest it has been since the second quarter of fiscal 2003.  Now, turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, total inventory was $13.6 billion, an increase of 21% from last year, and inventory turns were 5 times, about flat to last year.  The growth in inventory is primarily due to Home Depot Supply acquisitions, as well as new stores. On a per store basis, inventory levels were $5.8 million, which is about the same as the first quarter.  Computed on beginning long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 23.7%, an increase of 70 basis points from last year. We ended the quarter with $51.8 billion in assets, including $659 million in cash and short-term investments. This is a reduction of approximately $148 million in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2005, which includes cash flow generated by the business of approximately $5.8 billion, along with the net proceeds of $3.5 billion of term debt, offset by $3.8 billion paid to acquire new businesses, $2.8 billion paid for share repurchases, $1.5 billion of capital expenditures, $800 million used to repay commercial paper, and $628 million in dividends paid.  Our long-term debt-to-equity ratio at the end of the second quarter was approximately 24%.  Now, as Bob mentioned, we are upping our investment in our core business and will spend about $350 million more than we had planned. Of that, $180 million is capital, and we project that our full-year capital expenditures will be approximately $3.8 billion. $170 million of the accelerated investment is expense, and will be partially offset by reduction in certain non-customer facing initiatives.  In January, we told you that we though we would grow our 2006 sales by 14% to 17%, and grow our earnings per share by 10% to 14%. Given the current environment, we think comps could be flat to slightly negative in the back-half of the year. Based on our performance for the first-half of the year, our conservative view for the back-half of the year, and our reinvestment plans, we now believe we will grow our fiscal 2006 sales and earnings per share at the low-end of our guidance.  The Home Depot is a financial powerhouse and we are using the power of our stellar financial position to invest in our customers and our business. As Bob and Tom said, it is a challenging environment but we are taking action.  Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. Gwen, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We will go first to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the $350 million spend, as we think not only about the second half of \u201906, but about 2007 as well? Specifically, what I am interested in is the incremental investments, are those going to continue next year? What form and magnitude would those take? Ultimately, what payback do you think we would get from these?\nCarol B. Tome : Eric, good morning. As we mentioned, the $350 million spend for the back-half of the year is broken into both capital and expense. $180 million is capital, and that is capital that we will spend on revitalizing the front-end of our stores, as well as the merchandising resets that Tom talked about. Of the $170 million of expense, more than 50% of that is directly related to the investment that we are making in our associates. The remaining expense are expenses associated with the various store merchandising and store revitalization programs that we have underway.  As we think about what this means for then 2007, what you should expect is a continued investment in the retail business. As Bob mentioned in his comments, in an environment like this, it is all about investing to win, and that is what we are planning to do. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: So does this suggest that it is a -- strategy shift is the wrong word, but is this a changed mindset about the amount of investment that you want to make in the retail business permanently, and what payback do you think that means in terms of sales growth as well as profitability?\nCarol B. Tome : We have a balanced approach in terms of investing in our business, as you know, but if you look at the capital spend this year, the $3.8 billion, 95% of that capital spend is directly in support of the retail business. You should expect that to continue. \nOperator: We will go next to Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Good morning. In terms of the initiative with redeploying additional labor to the stores, can you give us additional specifics in terms of categories that we might see that labor, and is there any change in terms of the staffing, you know, thoughts on the store?\nCarl C. Liebert III: The way we allocate our labor model in the store is based on the types of stores, whether it be volume or the format of the store. What we are doing is reinvesting in the customer experience inside our store in the various types of store. For example, you will see more aprons on the front-end to take care of our customers. You will see more aprons in the departments in order to serve customers in the transactional side, and as Bob alluded to earlier, is making sure we have enough aprons in the store to make sure that we present that we are ready to go from a store-readiness perspective each and every day. It is really based on a store-by-store decision. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Then, Carol, can you provide additional color on the gross margin performance in the quarter?\nCarol B. Tome : Absolutely. If you want to just break it in its components, what we saw is a changing mix in the retail business, and the retail business saw accelerated growth, as Tom talked about, in appliances. Because appliances are a lower-margin category than the rest of the store, that puts some pressure on the gross margin. The gross margin in the retail business dropped 26 basis points to now about 33%.  On the supply side, we saw an evolving mix in the supply business because of the acquisition of Hughes. The supply margin of 26.5% in the second quarter is ahead of our plan, so we are very pleased with the synergies that Joe DeAngelo and the rest of the team are driving in that business. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Bob, I was very impressed with the accelerated retail investments for the back-half of the year. In light of those, how should we think about the comps in the back-half. \nRobert L. Nardelli : Well, I think as Carol said, we certainly would expect flat to negative comps in the second half of the year. \nCarol B. Tome : If I could just jump in, that is really reflecting the economic environment that we see ahead of us, and as you know, when you invest, it takes time to see a return on that investment. As Tom pointed out, in the categories that we have reset in those six pilot stores, the 100 bays are outperforming our control stores, so we feel good about that. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: So should we really expect then to see the benefits of these investments in 2007? I am just trying from a model perspective -- should we be more optimistic on \u201907 in light of the investments that are being made in the back-half of \u201906?\nCarol B. Tome : Well, there are a couple of dynamics to think about as you are building your model for 2007. We are investing in the business to win. We also have economic headwind that is coming right at us, so you have to balance those two things as you think about your model for 2007. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Okay, but in light of the economic backdrop that most of us probably already had in our models, should we then think this would give an additional lift?\nDiane Dayhoff: I do not think we can talk to you specifically about your specific model, so what Carol says I think is an overarching thought process. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Great. Thank you so much. \nOperator: We will go next to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. A quick question on the inventory. You talked about the sequential change from Q1 levels. Can you compare that to a year ago as well, and also just tell us how you think about your inventory in the context both of the slowing economic environment you see, but also your effort to raise customer service levels. \nCarol B. Tome : Yes, absolutely. Relative to a year ago, inventory in our stores is up. Some of that is by design. Some of it also is a reflection of the sales environment that we just discussed. We feel very good about the quality of the inventory in our stores. That is the most important thing. We will sell this through in the ordinary course of business. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Understood, just a very quick follow-up, a clarification on your guidance. You guided to the low-end of your 10% to 14% earnings guidance. How should we think about the $0.03 tax item? Is that included in your guidance or excluded?\nCarol B. Tome : It is included. We guide off of GAAP, so if you think about the first-half of the year, we earned $1.60, and if you look at the guidance towards the low-end of the earnings range, that would imply $1.40 in the back-half of the year. \nOperator: We will go next to Danielle Fox with Merrill Lynch. \nDanielle Fox - Merrill Lynch: Thank you, good morning. Bob, can you talk about what you are doing to develop the next generation of senior executives at Home Depot? In particular, what you are doing in terms of succession planning and how close you are to filling Tom\u2019s merchandising spot. \nRobert L. Nardelli : It has been one of the key initiatives in our company over the last five years. We are very proud of a number of initiatives as it relates to the store leadership program, our merchandising leadership program, our business leadership program. We are investing not only in the senior management but we will do over $600 million of training in our stores, in our associates this year.  We have a very robust process where we review succession planning with the board. We spend a significant amount of time, Dennis Donovan and myself, on the road. We did five days, just within the last four weeks, and we did six sessions a day across the country, meeting what we believe is top talent. We are looking very closely at positioning them in career-expanding opportunities.  The good news is Tom has agreed to stay on, which allows for a very orderly transition. I think we have rich, robust talent within this company that we are looking at from a transitional standpoint. \nDanielle Fox - Merrill Lynch: Great, then just a follow-up question about your acquisition strategy in the supply business. Could you revisit, now that we have two quarters of segment reporting for Home Depot Supply, could you revisit your next steps and longer range plans for driving supply to be I think a $25 billion business -- this was your target -- by 2010. At the analyst meeting, Carol, you mentioned that you did not expect to spend more in acquisitions over the next five years than you did over the past five years. Is that still your latest thinking in terms of how acquisitions will contribute to achieving that goal?\nRobert L. Nardelli : Well, we have the expert in the room, and Joe, why don\u2019t you comment on that?\nJoe DeAngelo: Certainly I think we are consistent with what we talked about in January, is that we are always looking at great acquisitions but they need to be the right acquisitions at the right time, so we are always looking for a willing seller with great talent, has a great business model, and is at the right price, and so we will continue to be right on that path. I think Frank Blake and his team, with Ted Decker, do an awesome job of just lining up the pipeline and being very discreet in terms of who we buy. We look at 10 to 15 for every one that we get.  Also, we are very much focused on just being an organic growth machine. So we buy everybody to grow. I think you have seen that in the Hughes acquisition to date and every acquisition we have had, so really, we look at it in terms of if you do not have a great, organic growth model, you do not earn the right to acquire.  We will stick on strategy and it will happen the same way it happened the last couple of years. \nDanielle Fox - Merrill Lynch: Do you feel like that 12%, which was a really good number, could have been even higher in a more robust demand environment? Or you are not really seeing the macro impact at the supply business?\nJoe DeAngelo: I think any time the economy goes up, you are going to get some tailwind on that. I could not be happier and prouder of what the teams have done in every one of the market segments that we participate in. \nOperator: We will go next to Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Thank you. Just a comment, then a question. I have been -- I am used to being audited from Quebec, so it feels good that it was only $0.03.\nCarol B. Tome : You feel our pain. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: The question is for Bob, I guess. The investment back in retail effectively marks a change where what we have been seeing is we have been paying actual lower labor hours than if anything lower investments in the past. What caused the change? Is it looking at your relative performance versus lows? Is it just a sense that the retail business was not moving in the direction that you thought? Obviously this is a pretty significant change, so there has to be something behind it. Thank you. \nRobert L. Nardelli : I think it is a multi-pronged response. Certainly I think in a down-market, we have to get more aggressive to hold share. That is clearly a priority for us in the second-half.  Two, as I said, seasonally we would adjust our labor models up in the spring, down in the fall, so consistent with the capital reinvestment, we all know that you can have great merchandise, great looking stores, but it is our associates that bring it to life. So it is just a logical extension of a capital investment to invest in our associates, to make sure that we have more associates on the floor when customers will be more discerning, have more choices, and we clearly are going to be aggressive and committed to holding and gaining share. We are starting to see very good results in our voice of customer, certainly supported by these initiatives, and certainly the opportunity for incentive recognition through Orange Juiced. Carl and the team were up in Minnesota last Sunday night, had a big celebration. We are going to be announcing the second quarter winners as soon as we get off this call.  So it is all about momentum. It is all about attitude. We wanted to convey a very robust, strong commitment.  I think Carol mentioned about the capital, 90% was in retail, so I do not see it as a dramatic change from where we have been, but we certainly are laser-focused in what we think will -- with the uncertainties of the second-half, we are laser-focused on retail. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: What does this do to the buyback?\nRobert L. Nardelli : I think Carol mentioned we still have about $1.5 billion remaining on our buyback. We have I think set a pattern as a corporation, and certainly in retail, we do not just announce buybacks, but we actually do them. As evidenced in what we have done over the last few years, we have returned 65% of our earnings back to our shareholders. As we said time and again, going forward, you should use what we have done as a representative model in your planning going forward.  Obviously that is all contingent upon board approval, but I certainly would say that what we have done is certainly something you could consider for the future. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Giving that you are reinvesting $350 million back in, and you are going to continue the buyback, have you changed your thoughts about the leverage that you would like in the company?\nRobert L. Nardelli : No, I think again, we said time and again, we have a pretty balanced approach. I think we are certainly reinvesting through stock repurchase. We have taken the dividends from $0.16 when I got here to $0.60, while at the same time, I think you would agree with me, Gary, that the strategic reinvestment in going from zero to $12 billion in our Home Depot Supply business certainly broadens our ability, broadens our customer base.  Just here in Atlanta, we will go from a $4 billion market to a $14 billion market by a combination of stores and branches. In 12 months, we now have a $1 billion catalogue business. In three years, we have a $1 billion business in Mexico.  I think the approach is balanced. I think we are very sensitive to a broad range of constituents out there. I think we have been very responsible in our actions, and we will be going forward. \nCarol B. Tome : If I could just jump in, as you know, we have added additional leverage into our capital structure, increasing our debt-to-equity ratio to now 24%, where last year it was 9%. We have a tremendous amount of cash that comes off of our business. Our stores are cash cows. On average, they generate $5 million in EBITDA. We have access to tremendous leverage outside of the business. We can do whatever we need to do. \nOperator: We will go next to Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank. \nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: Thank you, just a couple quick ones here. Just on the guidance, I think originally when you gave the guidance in January of 10% to 14% earnings growth, it did exclude any impact of share buyback, and then I think you reiterated that at least offline, in the first quarter to me. Is that still the case, this 10% to 14%? Does that exclude your assumption of share buybacks?\nCarol B. Tome : What I would like you to think about is in the second quarter, we had $0.03 of accretion from our buyback program, and we lost $0.03 because of the Quebec tax assessment, so those two offset each other.  What we are guiding from is GAAP, freezing the buyback as of where we are today, and then looking forward to the back-half of the year, so the full year guidance we have given you is at the low-end of the EPS growth of 10% to 14%. Does that help?\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: You said, sorry, freezing the buyback where you are today?\nCarol B. Tome : Just from a modeling perspective. \nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: Right, in other words, not assuming any more buybacks. \nCarol B. Tome : Correct. That is right, yes. \nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: Now that I think, the way you said it in January, and I wanted to be clear. Then, quickly one more, on the Home Depot, so you said you are planning conservatively. Bob, you said you are planning conservatively, but then said not at retail. Does that imply that you are planning conservatively at the Home Depot Supply business? Broadly speaking, the macro slowdown, which I think we are all seeing here, is that more impactful to Home Depot Supply or your Home Depot retail business?\nRobert L. Nardelli : Two comments, and then I will flip it over to Joe on the second half. My comment was specifically uncharacteristically, companies would probably pull back, given the downward pressure in the economy. My comment was specifically as it related to our retail announcement of the $350 million of accelerated expenditures, in that uncharacteristically, we were going to accelerate investments in spite of the uncertainty in the economy.  I think Carol shared with you from a guidance standpoint at the retail level with same-store sales, so again, we are planning conservatively as it would relate to that. We are being very aggressive. Our capital reinvestment was the point I was trying to make.  I think Joe, as he indicated, will stay the course, but I would ask Joe to comment. \nJoe DeAngelo: I think when you look at Home Depot Supply, we have a very diverse portfolio now, which really helps through any cycle, so we are about 36% infrastructure, about 43% construction, 16% maintenance, 4% repair and remodel, about 2% international, so no matter what is happening in a cycle, our philosophy is we are going be number one in every one of those segments. When certain things go down, certain other things go up, so we plan to have strong performance through the back half. \nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: If I could slide in one more -- actually, I will turn it over to someone else. Thank you. \nOperator: We will go next to Dave Strasser with Banc of America Securities. \nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: Thank you. In listening to your vendors conference calls for the second quarter, virtually all of them talked about trying to raise prices and push pricing through as a result of commodities. They talked about in a lot of different ways. How are those negotiations going and where is that level of discussion at this point?\nRobert L. Nardelli : It is interesting. Before Tom answers, having been on the other side of the fence in selling to major retailers, I am going to be interested to hear Tom\u2019s comment. \nThomas V. Taylor : Thank you, Bob. I think we feel very good about our vendor negotiations, as we may have mentioned on a previous call, or certainly in my one-on-one sessions with the analysts. We added a vendor management team at the end of the last quarter. They are in place now, assisting our merchants when we do see price increases, and aggressively going out, going after, taking costs out of our business.  We feel good about it. I think that we are approaching our negotiations better-educated than we have ever been. I think the merchants are coming with great knowledge and an understanding, so when a vendor partner comes in with a price increase, we have a better understanding and can negotiate favourably.  I think we are doing a very good job. \nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: Philosophically, when you think about it, when you are going to accept them at some point, is it something that you would most likely plan on passing through, or would you accept increases that you did not think you could?\nRobert L. Nardelli : I think in our discussions with our supplier partners, and they have been great, is we both work on the same objective -- that is, to get volume and hold customer volume traffic. At the end of the day, if in fact commodity prices, and we feel good about the productivity pass through that our suppliers are giving us, it would be our position to test the market. If they hold, then we will stay there. If they do not, then we go back and talk with our supplier about sharing the burden, but certainly not being uncompetitive in the marketplace.  A point too, I think one of the big advantages we have in addition to broadening our customer base through supply is the commonality of our suppliers. Joe and his team along with Tom have had some great harmonizing discussions with our suppliers. Again, if you look at our cost of goods sold, we certainly have a premier position in talking to the suppliers and again, keep in mind not only have we added 900 stores, but we have added 900 branches. So their ability not only to grow in the existing channels, but those precious new channels that Joe talked about in construction, industrial, and so forth, in giving them access to market is a huge opportunity for them through the same company base. \nDiane Dayhoff: Gwen, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: We will go next to Joe Feldman with Telsi Advisory Group. \nJoe Feldman - Telsi Advisory Group: One question about the supply chain. I know Mark is pretty new there and you had suggested, Bob, in your earlier comments that he has already even had a little impact. I was just wondering, from his perspective, if he is available, what he has seen and where he thinks there might be some opportunities. \nRobert L. Nardelli : Let me say this. Mark is not in the room because he is doing what all new associates do. He is working in the store, and I think even though he has close to 30 years of experience, I think it is important, and he is having a great time working in the store, working all the departments. He has also spent a significant amount of time obviously in our DDC\u2019s, transfer centers.  I think the first thing Mark is looking at is bringing his experience and how we might optimize what we currently have. Tom and I are very pleased with certainly his fresh look. Concurrent with that, and I think Mark is going to be looking at where do we go from our current system and how do we maximize what we have to where do we want to go? Basically, we have asked Mark to come in with no preconceptions, no mandate but a clean sheet approach. Bring his wealth of experience over the years, and then come up with a recommendation. \nJoe Feldman - Telsi Advisory Group: The one last thing I wanted to ask, on the new Orange Juiced program, can you describe a little more in detail how it works and what type of metrics that you actually measure and how you measure them?\nCarl C. Liebert III: We actually spend an enormous amount of time looking at overall satisfaction in the store, as well as likelihood to recommend, because we know that is an important metric for our customers, as well as loyalty in our consumer base.  So what we have is monthly winners by region. As you know, we have RVP\u2019s in the marketplace. Each RVP is allowed to award overall satisfaction metrics as well as most improved within the month. We award monetary awards at the store level. Most importantly, at the associate level. The benefits go directly back to the associates who are serving our customers.  As Bob alluded to, I was in Michigan earlier this week for our highest overall satisfaction store in the chain. We celebrated and we awarded five associates a monetary bonus that serve our customers. They were nominated by their peers as the best servers of customers in their store, and they received that award. Bob is going to pull the names out of the hat for the second quarter here shortly after this call, and then we will be traveling out to three stores, one store in each division, three stores total, to award those checks to those associates as well.  It has been a huge morale lift for our stores and a big win. We invested over $30 million and if you are a divisional associate, one of the winners, you get a check for $10,000. So five associates in these three divisional winning stores get a check for $10,000 each. It is a great, great win for the person. \nDiane Dayhoff: Thanks, everybody, for being on the call with us today. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. \nOperator: Thank you everyone. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2006, "date": "2006-05-16 14:05:36", "content": "Executives: Diane Dayhoff - VP IR  Bob Nardelli - Chairman, President, CEO  Tom Taylor - EVP Merchandising & Marketing  Carol Tome - EVP & CFO  Joe DeAngelo - EVP Home Depot Supply \nAnalysts: Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup  Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley  Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley  Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research  Gary Balter - CSFB  Colin McGranahan - Bernstein  Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group\nOperator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Home Depot first quarter 2006 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Beginning today's discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n Diane Dayhoff:  Thank you, Gwen, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining us on our call today are Bob Nardelli, Chairman, President and CEO of The Home Depot; Carol Tome, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Tom Taylor, Executive Vice President of merchandising and marketing; and Joe DeAngelo, Executive Vice President and President of Home Depot Supply.  Today's discussion will begin with a review of our business by Bob. Tom will provide insight into our merchandising efforts, and Joe will update you on The Home Depot Supply. Carol will complete our prepared statement with a discussion of our financial results. Following our prepared remarks we will open the line for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors, and as a reminder we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up. This conference call is being broadcast real time on the Internet at HomeDepot.com with links on both our home page and the Investor Relations section. A replay will also be available on our site.  Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now let me turn the call over to Bob Nardelli.\nBob Nardelli:  Thanks, Diane. Our first quarter financial performance reinforced our three-prong strategy to grow the top line, expand our product and service offerings, while continuing to deliver record EPS. In the first quarter we delivered record sales of over $21 billion. Net earnings were $1.5 billion and diluted EPS were $0.70, an increase of almost 23%.  Given the growth in Home Depot Supply, we will for the first time be reporting two segments: Home Depot Retail and Home Depot Supply. Carol Tome will take you through the details of our financial results in a minute, but now I would like to share with you some highlights of both of these segments. In the first quarter the retail business drove solid gross margin expansion. We again demonstrated our ability to leverage expenses and reported a record operating margin. We also achieved a record average ticket of over $60, and while we continue to gain momentum with average ticket, we were disappointed with the overall retail sales.  We did see strong sales in areas like building materials, electrical, hardware, kitchen and bath, but weakness in two key areas, seasonal and flooring. Now we are well-prepared for spring and summer, and Tom Taylor will expand upon this in his remarks. Our service business grew by 8.5% during the first quarter. We saw solid growth in installation categories such as countertops, windows, solar and exterior patio and doors, but experienced softness in flooring, which historically has been a strong installation category for us.  As we discussed in the past, we are committed to improving the shopping experience and driving growth in transactions. Tom will talk about our merchandising initiatives, including an accelerated reinvestment program for the stores later on in the call. During the quarter we expanded our product offerings through Home Depot Direct. Our website continues to grow as an e-commerce site and with over 4 million visits per week. Our assortment is also expanded through our various catalogs.  On May 1st we acquired Home Decorators Collection. Home Decorators Collection is an ideal and strategic fit for Home Depot Direct, doubling its size and significantly increasing its presence in the affordable home decor category. This acquisition gives us immediate scale in the direct-to-customer market with its 3.3 million customer file, providing us with a new customer base in industry-leading skills to expand our direct-to-consumer platform. With the acquisition of Home Decorators Collection, Home Depot Direct will be a $1 billion business by the end of fiscal 2006. We are pleased to welcome the associates of Home Decorators Collection to the Home Depot family. As in the United States, in Canada and Mexico we maintained our leadership position and currently we have 141 stores in Canada, and expect to open an additional 14 stores this year. In Mexico we have 56 stores and expect to open an additional four stores this year. By the end of this year Mexico will be a $1 billion business. Today approximately 10% of our store base is located in Canada and Mexico, and both businesses reported solid financial results in the quarter. Now I would like to turn to Home Depot Supply. This business is an important growth driver for us, and we use a disciplined approach to develop or to acquire businesses that build off our strength, scale and core competencies, as well as leverage common customers and suppliers.  The first quarter represented a significant milestone for us. We closed on the Hughes Supply acquisition on March 30th. This is our largest acquisition, which more than doubled Home Depot Supply. Hughes strengthens our market position, gives us new platforms and brings a wealth of talent into our company. With this acquisition we are better positioned to serve the professional customer. Hughes is a great company with strong leaders, and we welcome the associates into the Home Depot family. Joe DeAngelo will provide more detail on Home Depot Supply later. During the quarter we continue to focus on returning value to our shareholders. We recently increased our dividends by 50% and over the past five years we have more than doubled our dividends paid. In February, our Board approved an additional $1 billion for share repurchases, bringing our total share repurchase authorization to $12 billion. Since the inception of our buyback program we have repurchased $10.3 billion or approximately 13% of our outstanding shares.  Our commitment to dividends and share repurchase is part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, of reinvesting back into our business for growth and returning cash to our shareholders. Over the past five years we have returned nearly 60% of our cumulative earnings to our shareholders. So now I would like to turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Taylor:  Thanks, Bob, and good morning everybody. From a merchandising perspective we were better prepared for spring than I have seen in a long time, and we saw great average ticket growth across the store. While I don't want to sound like a weather report, unusually wet weather in the west -- where we have high concentration of stores -- impacted transactions.  Although we continue to gain momentum with average ticket, we were disappointed with transactions, and it is not just weather. As Bob mentioned, the weakness in the quarter was due to seasonal and flooring. Today we are pleased with our performance in seasonal, as weather across the country has improved, and we are addressing the softness in flooring through several initiatives, including reset. We see increased customer satisfaction and great sales lift when we reset a category. For example, our recent faucet reset drove a 5.3% increase in units and our recent decking reset drove an 8.3% increase in units. So beginning in this quarter we are accelerating additional reset activity in 500 of our highest volume stores, and we will reset over 100 days in each of those stores by year end. We are also moving forward with some additional major category expansion in areas like appliances and ceramic tile.  Another way to drive traffic in conversion in our stores is to continue our focus on introducing distinctive and innovative products. I will talk more about the merchandise you will see in our stores in a minute, but first let's discuss some of highlights in the first quarter. We posted strong double-digit sales growth in our professional categories, due to benefits from initiatives we implemented in early 2005 and our continued focus on providing the Pro's with superior service. Additionally, we experienced some commodity price inflation during the quarter. We experienced strength in Pro Classes including gypsum, insulation, concrete, wire, conduit, wire devices, fasteners and pipes and fittings to mention a few.  Kitchen and bath showed strong performance driven by both in-store and online appliance sales, as well as sales of countertop and bath installations. In appliances, our momentum continued as we grew market share and hit our highest close rate ever. According to an independent third party, on a rolling twelve-month basis our core market share increased 140 basis points to 9.9%. Our results were driven by our merchandising assortment and knowledgeable associates. For over a year now we have had dedicated associates in our consulting and selling areas focused exclusively on their respective product and services. Our customers continue to be enthusiastic about our full set of LG appliances. They also responded well to the introduction of new innovative products particularly our GE Smart Dispense dishwasher, Maytag Ice2O refrigerator, Maytag blue metallic laundry set and GE Adora front loaders.  As Bob mentioned, and as a result of our relentless focus on innovation our average ticket for the quarter was $60.75, representing a 4.3% increase over the previous year. While spring was late, when it arrived we were pleased with our outdoor living category. We saw strength in everything from grills to exterior paint. During the quarter we broadened our assortment of patio furniture, adding wrought iron patio sets, tables and fire pits and ceramic tile tops. Our customers are responding to these additions as well as our commanding assortment in garden where we've introduced many exciting new and exclusive products.  Our outdoor power equipment line-up is unparalleled in the industry. We carry seven of the top 10 rated lawn mowers and three of the top 10 rated tractors in our stores and on our website. This, together with our in-store certified power equipment specialists, makes us the clear destination for outdoor power equipment.  We're selling lawn tractors online for the first time in 2006 and are extremely pleased with the results. We've seen enthusiasm over our Cub Cadet and Toro zero turn mowers which allow for closer cuts, greater maneuverability and reduces your cutting time. Sales of both have significantly exceeded our expectations. It is these types of experiences that we want to repeat across the entire store. To create this we must continuously introduce new, distinctive and innovative products. That is why as I look forward, I am particularly excited by the merchandise we will be offering in our stores in this quarter.  In appliances we will continue our momentum through the addition of several new refrigerators, freezers and ranges. For example, we will add refrigerators from LG, General Electric, Maytag, Jenn Air and Americana. Some of these products will have the latest features including smart water filtration, upfront electronic controls and spill-proof glass shelves. In paint, we have a new exclusive sports-themed paint line called team colors. Through this program customers can purchase paint in the exact colors of their favorite professional and college sports teams. Timing is great because it coincides with the beginning of the major league baseball season and the NBA and NHL playoffs. We will offer more than 400 paint colors representing more than 125 different teams. In flooring we are enhancing our offering by updating our laminate assortment, adding more natural stone tile products and a new line of odor resistant carpet called [Purell].  In our power tool area we will introduce the DeWalt 36 volt lithium ion cordless combo kit representing the next generation of cordless power tools, with even more torque and a longer run-time. We will also continue expanding the Ryobi One Plus system, adding more products like the Ryobi One Plus Fan and the Ryobi One Plus Hand [planer].  We plan to roll out a new bathroom vanity top program with products that will feature styles and finishes not previously available in the market such as a matte finished onyx top.  In lighting we will bring in new interior lighting families, new lamps and upgraded commercial electric recess cans.  In millwork we will carry Anderson low E-4 high-performance glass for windows and patio doors. This is an innovative, low maintenance product which is energy efficient, reduces sound penetration and features a unique exterior coating making cleaning easier. These products, together with our focus on store modernization should create excitement in our store. What excites me the most are the opportunities within the store. I believe we have endless opportunities to continue adding innovation and distinctive merchandise to our core categories. This will help us create excitement, drive traffic and make our stores more productive. Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe DeAngelo.\nJoe DeAngelo:  Thanks, Tom. The Home Depot Supply team delivered an exceptional first-quarter executing year-over-year sales growth of 225% and operating earnings growth of 432%. With total sales of $2.1 billion, Home Depot Supply represents almost 10% of Home Depot's first quarter sales.  Excluding 2006 acquired sales, total revenues of Home Depot Supply grew by 151% in the first quarter and for the businesses we owned as of the end of the first quarter last year the year-over-year sales growth was approximately 18%. Powerful organic growth is a hallmark of our Home Depot Supply business model and our strong first-quarter performance is the direct result of our team's exhaustive focus on delivering increased customer success. Home Depot Supply's first quarter 2006 operating profit was $149 million, representing 6% of Home Depot's consolidated operating profit, with an operating margin of 7%, a triple-digit increase from the first quarter of 2005. We closed the Hughes Supply acquisition on March 30th and I'm extremely proud of the joint team that delivered an exceptionally smooth close and integration kick-off. The senior leadership teams at each business have been named and are focused on executing their integration and growth plans. All integration areas are ahead of plan, and we are particularly pleased with the stellar integration and implementation in our four overlapping businesses of maintenance repair and operations, waterworks, construction supply and plumbing and HVAC. Our Home Depot Supply leadership teams have visited with over 2,000 customers of these overlapping businesses and alignment of all sales teams is complete. Because of the teams' efforts we are continuing our strong sales momentum in all business units.  During the first two weeks after closing the Hughes transaction our new combined Home Depot Supply leadership team executed 13 road shows, visiting the leadership of each Home Depot Supply business unit and discussing our Home Depot Supply vision and mission with approximately 3,000 field and headquarter associates.  As part of the road show, each business President solidified their businesses 2006 execution imperatives and worked with their teams to define how they will continue to accelerate transformation in the industries in which they participate. Our momentum is tremendous and it continues to build as we operate as one team driving customer success and shareholder value. We are well on our way to achieving our committed Hughes deal synergies. As we continue to execute processes to harmonize Home Depot enterprise-wide supplier programs, allowing us to buy better. We will also sell more by aligning our sales teams to support each other as they sell around our customer's circle of business platforms from infrastructure through construction to lifetime maintenance and improvement.  Today less than 20% of Home Depot Supply sales are to new home builders. We have a diversified business platform with concentration in infrastructure and maintenance. In addition, on May 1st we closed the acquisition of Cox Lumber, a family run lumber and building materials business which has been added to our Williams Brothers Lumber platform, expanding our presence into the robust Florida market. Together Williams Brothers and Cox Lumber are $1 billion business. We could not be happier to welcome Hughes Supply and Cox Lumber associates to our Home Depot Supply team and we look afford to working with them to drive exceptional growth and customer success. Home Depot Supply now operates over 900 locations in 44 U.S. states and in Canada and we look forward to continuing to enhance our geographic reach as, together with our core Home Depot retail business, we offer professional customers exceptional convenience, choice and value. Thanks to our great team effort we are off to a terrific start for 2006. Now I would like to turn the call over to Carol Tome.\nCarol Tome:  Thank you, Joe, and hello everyone. Before I get into the details of our first quarter financial results there are a few things I would like to highlight from a reporting perspective.  First as Bob mentioned, we are now operating and reporting our business in two segments, Home Depot Retail and Home Depot Supply. The retail segment includes our retail stores, as well as our retail installation business we call Services and Home Depot Direct, our catalog and online sales business. The supply segment is our trade distribution segment and consists of businesses like Hughes Supply.  For comparability purposes we have moved away from comp sales reporting and now will provide sales growth for both segments as a percentage change over the prior period. We will continue to provide you with retail operating metrics, including sales per square foot and weighted average weekly store sales. Finally, in the past Services revenue included new homebuilder installation revenues that are now reported as part of Home Depot Supply. Going forward any discussion about Services revenue will pertain to installation services in our retail stores and our services franchise known as Chem-Dry.  So with that as a background: as Bob mentioned in the first quarter, our total company sales grew by 13.1% or $2.5 billion to $21.5 billion. Of the $2.5 billion in sales growth, $1 billion came from our retail segment, and $1.5 billion came from our supply segment. In the first quarter, sales in the retail segment were $19.4 billion, a 5.7% increase over the same period in 2005. This sales increase was primarily driven by the addition of new stores. We saw strong growth within our supply segment. As Joe mentioned, sales in the supply segment were $2.1 billion, up 225% over the same period in 2005. We look at sales growth in this segment from an organic and an acquired perspective. For us, acquired sales means sales dollars acquired during the fiscal year.  In the first quarter of 2006 we completed the acquisition of Hughes Supply and the total sales acquired in the first quarter were $483 million. Excluding 2006 acquired sales, total revenues at Home Depot Supply grew by 151% in the first quarter. For the businesses we owned as of the end of the first quarter last year, the year-over-year growth rate was approximately 18%. We were pleased with the first quarter operating income results of both segments. Compared to last year, both segments reflected operating margin expansion. Operating margin in the retail segment grew by 98 basis to 11.8% in the quarter and in the supply segment grew by 273 basis points to 7%. We will review the key drivers of this performance in a minute.  Consolidated net earnings totaled $1.5 billion for the quarter, an increase of 19% over the first quarter of 2005. Reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, earnings per share increased by 22.8% to $0.70 per share. In the first quarter, consolidated gross margin was 33.68%, an increase of 19 basis points from the same period last year.  As we have told you, today's supply has a lower gross margin rate than our retail business. In the first quarter the gross margin rate for supply dropped 400 basis points from last year to approximately 28%. This was entirely due to a change in the mix of businesses acquired during the year. The businesses we owned at the end of the first quarter last year reported gross margin expansion of approximately 140 basis points. In the first quarter, Home Depot Supply had a negative impact of 36 basis points on our consolidated gross margin rate. We more than made up for that in the retail segment due to: In the first quarter we continued to drive expense productivity as our total operating expenses decreased 56 basis points from the same period last year to 22.39% of sales. For both retail and supply we drove expense leverage in most of our major expense categories. Part of our expense leverage was due to certain process improvements that reduced claim frequency and severity. During the quarter we experienced a significant reduction in workers compensation and general liability expense. On the retail front, given that about 65% of our expenses are variable, we have a tremendous amount of flexibility in managing expenses. On the supply front, we have a relentless focus on integration and driving efficiencies. Consolidated operating margin for the first quarter was 11.29%, up 75 basis points from the same period last year.  Net interest expense was $52 million in the first quarter, up $39 million from the first quarter last year, reflecting interest associated with $1 billion of term debt issued in August 2005 and $4 billion of term debt issued earlier this year in connection with our acquisition of Hughes. In the first quarter our income tax provision rate increased to 37.4% from 37.2% last year, reflecting the reversal of deferred tax assets for which the future tax benefit no longer exists. For the year we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37.2%. Diluted shares for the first quarter were 2.122 billion shares compared to 2.172 billion shares at the end of the first quarter of 2005. The reduction in outstanding shares is due to our share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we repurchased 14 million shares and cumulatively since 2002, when the program began, we have repurchased 291 million shares and spent $10.3 billion under our $10 billion authorization. Now before we move to the balance sheet, I would like to share with you some operational metrics for the retail stores. During the first quarter we opened 23 new stores, including four relocations with four new stores in Canada and two new stores in Mexico. Approximately 10% of our store base is found in Canada and Mexico, and we are the market leader in those two countries.  Today we own 87% of our retail stores. Our real estate strategy going forward is to own our stores where we can and to lease the majority of our Home Depot Supply facility. At the end of the first quarter selling square footage was 216 million, a 6.4% increase from a year ago. The average square footage per store was 105,000 square feet, down slightly from the same period last year, reflecting the changing mix in our store formats as we expand into new geographies and size our stores to meet the needs of the market. Sales per square foot were approximately $364 for the quarter, down slightly from last year but sales per square foot in our new stores increased by over 4%.  Tom talked about accelerating our merchandise reset activities. Our new stores have our new merchandising sets and given the positive sales trends we are experiencing in these stores, that's another reason for accelerating the activity. Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter total inventory was $13.4 billion, an increase of 18.5% from last year and inventory turns were 4.6 times, down slightly from last year. The growth in inventory is primarily due to new stores, and the acquisitions we made at Home Depot Supply. On a per store basis retail inventory increased by 1.6%. Total working capital for the Company, which we define as receivables plus inventory less payables, was $7.4 billion, down from $7.8 billion at year end. That is notable as we acquired about $900 million of working capital with the Hughes acquisition.  Computed on beginning long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 24.2%, an increase of 220 basis points from last year. We ended the quarter with $52.7 billion in assets, including $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is a cash increase of approximately $1.8 billion from the end of fiscal 2005, which reflects cash flow generated by the business of approximately $4 billion, along with the net proceeds of $4 billion of term debt.  This is offset by $3.3 billion paid to acquire new businesses, $705 million of capital expenditures, $554 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $900 million used to repay outstanding commercial paper, $500 million used to repay maturing senior notes and $318 million in dividends paid.  As I mentioned, we issued $4 billion of term debt in the first quarter to fund the Hughes acquisition and refinanced $500 million of maturing debt. With the $4 billion debt issuance, our long-term debt to equity ratio increased from approximately 10% at year end to now approximately 24%. As we discussed at our January investor conference, our fiscal 2006 growth guidance is aligned with our 2010 vision to grow our sales by 9% to 12% and to grow our earnings per share by 10% to 14%. We also told you that with the acquisition of Hughes Supply we believed our 2006 sales would grow in the range of 14% to 17%, and our earnings per share would grow in the range of 10% to 14%. We are confident of the guidance we gave you in January and reaffirm our sales and earnings growth targets for the year and through 2010. Thank you for your participation in today's call. We are now ready for questions.\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Deborah Weinswig, Citigroup.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Good morning, and congratulations on a great quarter. In terms of the SG&A strength that we saw in the quarter, can you provide a little bit of additional color? How should we think about that in light of future quarters? And was the majority of this improvement driven by redeploying capital to selling hours? What additional color can you provide?\nBob Nardelli:  Let me give you an overview and then I will turn it over to Carol. I think you have seen our Company demonstrate its ability to leverage expenses commensurate with sales variation. I think that is a very, very positive sign for a retailer and I commend the entire team for taking on this initiative.  We are using a variety of initiatives in here as you know, Deborah; Six Sigma is certainly gaining momentum, and Carl Liebert and the entire team has really embraced this tool, and we are seeing the benefit of it.  As you know our overarching core purpose is to improve everything we touch, and we are continually seeking out opportunities across the entire business, starting from suppliers all the way to customers. As Joe DeAngelo mentioned, certainly through our acquisitions our purchasing power has increased. Our logistics opportunities are increasing. So we are seeing opportunities for leverage almost in every area of our business, and we certainly see that continuing through the balance of the year. Carol, do you want to add anything more to that?\nCarol Tome:  Just to add, Bob, that we did see expense leverage in most of our major expense categories. The only place where we saw expenses running faster than sales is depreciation and amortization, and that is directly related to the investment activity that we have in our business.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup:  Definitely impressive and definitely bucking the trends. Last question, can you talk about what you learned in the appliance business and best practices that you can apply to other categories? I think Tom talked about the fact there are endless opportunities within the store, and maybe in light of the appliance categories specifically and what you've learned there.\nBob Nardelli:  Deborah, I think our focus on appliances over the last three years certainly demonstrates the strength that Home Depot has given the geographic reach of or stores and the convenience that we provide to our customers. Tom mentioned in his comments, we're very pleased with the mix in the assortment in the innovation. Tom will talk a little bit about how our success in that category certainly gives us encouragement to go faster and will be a big part of the 500 store resets through the balance of the year.\nTom Taylor:  I think what we've learned and are looking to apply is in three things, one is shopping environment. I think we created a good shopping environment in the stores for appliances for customers to make a decision. Two, innovation, I think we've worked well with our vendor partners to bring in innovation, introduced new appliances quickly. And then three, as I think through Carl and my partnership, having dedicated staffing set up to that category in the store. I think that we are under a full year now of dedicated staffing in that department and it's really paying dividends.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup:  Great. Congratulations again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Armando Lopez, Morgan Stanley.\nArmando Lopez - Morgan Stanley:  Just a couple of quick questions. On the appliance business you guys have made impressive gains there. Can you just talk about as you continue to add SKUs, maybe what areas of floor space you're pulling away from?\nTom Taylor:\nArmando Lopez - Morgan Stanley: In terms of the organic growth in the Home Depot Supply I was a little bit unclear in terms of what the organic growth rate was. Could you just kind of go over that again? I know you touched on it.\nBob Nardelli:  Carol, why don't you go back over first the definition of acquisition in organic and then the numbers one more time?\nCarol Tome:  Sure. We look at sales growth in this segment from both an organic and acquisitive perspective. For us, we define acquired sales as sales dollars acquired in any one fiscal year. So in the first quarter of 2006 we acquired, as Hughes Supply and the total sales in 2006 were $483 million. So if you back those out, the year-over-year growth in Home Depot Supply is 151%.  But then if you just look at the businesses we owned a year ago and said how did those businesses grow year-over-year, they grew by 18%. So very robust growth in the businesses that we owned a year ago.\nArmando Lopez - Morgan Stanley: So the National Waterworks that you guys acquired a couple quarters ago, that is included in the 151%?\nCarol Tome:  That's exactly right. That's exactly right.\nBob Nardelli: Just for ease of reporting, We have selected a model that says if you are acquired within the year, that is acquisition. Once you get through the fiscal year it is part of the core growth. It just is a very easy and simple way for us to communicate to you how we are looking at this segment.\nCarol Tome:  But I can take it out for you if that helps for your modeling. The acquired sales that we bought in 2006 were $483 million. The acquired sales that we bought in 2005 were $876 million, and then the year-over-year change in the businesses we owned a year ago were $115 million. So that might be helpful to you.\nArmando Lopez - Morgan Stanley:  Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregory Melich, Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Just a follow-up on what is driving gross margin. I was interested in what financing costs did in the quarter. I know that interest rates are up and I think in the last quarter it hurt gross margin. I am just wondering if that is helping the mix get to those higher price points. Can you describe all that a little bit?\nBob Nardelli:  I wish that was the case, but not necessarily. Carol, do you want to cover that?\nCarol Tome:  Well, we continue to see a great response and use of our private label credit card. The penetration of our private label credit card is now 27% of all tender type in our stores, so that is just great and our customers respond very favorably to our deferred interest programs. That is where there's no interest, no payment for six months or 12 months.  There is a financing cost associated with that. That financing cost runs through our cost of goods sold. Year-over-year there wasn't a material change, and it didn't have a material impact to our gross profit margin rate.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley:  And so zero percent financing wasn't up year-over-year?\nCarol Tome:  Not materially, no.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley:  Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Binder, Buckingham Research.\nDaniel Binder - Buckingham Research: Just a couple questions. First, with regard to a lot of the reset activity that you are doing in 500 stores, it sounds like that might be in reaction, to some extent, to some of the softness you saw this quarter. I just want to clarify if that is accurate or not. I was just trying to think about how that might impact expenses, particularly in Q2 as you start that up.  My second question was related to a comment that Wal-Mart made earlier today regarding possible a tax rate change as a result of possible non-renewal of the workers opportunity tax credit. I am just wondering if that is something that could potentially impact Home Depot.\nBob Nardelli:  Let me just respond to your second question and reconfirm both Tom and Carol's comment. What we saw certainly in our new stores, as Carol talked about sales per square foot, Tom's comment about now that we are six to eight months into some of these new store sets certainly gave us the confidence. If you will recall some of the numbers he shared with you relative to unit growth rate, that would certainly reinforce that by accelerating the resets in those specific areas and the capital associated with it makes good sense.  If you look at our store base, the fact that we are well over 2,000 stores; and as you know in retail requires continual refresh, reset and innovation. So I think given the confidence and the results we've seen is reinforcing that we should move more aggressively in our existing stores to match the performance of our new stores.\nCarol Tome: From a cost perspective the total cost of this program is around $81 million, of which $55 million is capital, the remainder is expense. In the second quarter the expense will be minimal maybe a couple million dollars.  To your last question about the workers tax credit, we have factored in our belief that that tax credit will disappear. We factor that into our tax provision guidance that we just gave you of 37.2% for the full year.\nBob Nardelli: Tom do you want to comment anymore about the sets?\nTom Taylor:  Just that the sets were carefully selected out of our top-performing business sub-classes and with a focus on selection, presentation, innovation and improving the shopping experience> Historically we love the results that we see when we do resets and we're going to go into those stores and execute.\nDaniel Binder - Buckingham Research:  Maybe if I could sneak in one follow-up, with regard to the sales in the first quarter, you cited weather. I'm just kind of wondering from a labor standpoint how you felt about the staffing levels in the store, now both in the aisles and the front end in terms of the quality and quantity. Do you feel like you have the right labor levels to do the business?\nBob Nardelli:  I think two points. One is as Tom mentioned, weather would specifically relate to department 28 which is outdoor power and live goods; and particularly as Tom referenced on the West Coast where we have a heavy concentration.  Spring was late this year, and if you look at any of the adjustment, it was relative to where we normally would have ramped. Carl and his team I think did an excellent job in looking at labor on a sales-adjusted basis. So we're pretty comfortable where we came out on the quarter. I think it demonstrates and reinforces again a credit to the team that they are able to vary expense with sales in appropriate way.\nDaniel Binder - Buckingham Research: Are labor optimization efforts that you pursued in the last year or two pretty much done or is there still opportunity on that?\nBob Nardelli:  No, I think two things, maybe three things. We're continuing, as you know, to invest in technology. Every time we do that Bob DeRodes, working with Carl, eliminates a task that allows us to redeploy and reallocate, whether it is the back end or whether it is across the entire store. So that is point number one.  Point number two I think if you look at just the overall store layout Tom and Carl are partnering very closely together on these resets to make sure we really take into consideration and minimize tasking labor that allows us to redeploy it to selling labor.\nDaniel Binder - Buckingham Research:  Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Balter, Credit Suisse.\nGary Balter - CSFB:  A question that is a little bit longer term or strategic in nature. Bob, people don't seem to appreciate the direction that the Company is moving based on the way when we look at stock price and we look at even today's reaction.  Your coverage ratios are pretty strong. Your 24% long-term debt to equity right now, although that is an artificial number because of the buyback. What are your thoughts about what other steps you can take beyond just operational to show your commitment to the stock?\nBob Nardelli:  Well, I think, Gary, it's a fair question and one that you and I have talked and many of us talk about, I will take you back to our strategy. We have never been more committed to enhancing our core, as evidenced in our comments today and the reacceleration into our installed base. We think the geographic reach that we have is certainly a compelling and a competitive advantage.  I think the multi-pronged approach, Gary, as you've commented and Joe talked about today; I think broadening to our platform and gaining access into a $400 billion market certainly strengthens our Company. I think over time the intrinsic value that we are demonstrating, our ability to be very acquisitive yet also deliver very strong integration results while attracting great businesses, great leaders, new suppliers, new customers; I think is a very compelling proposition for Home Depot and Home Depot stock. Carol, do you want to comment any further on that to Gary?\nCarol Tome: In addition to what we are doing to grow the business, of course, is what we've done with regard to our shareholders in terms of returning capital. Since Bob came we have more than doubled our dividend, we increased the dividend by 50% alone in January. Repurchasing now about 13% of our outstanding shares and our Board has been extraordinarily supportive in our share repurchase program. You should take from that that we will continue to do the right things for our shareholders.\nGary Balter - CSFB:  I agree with everything you both said and we have been buying the stock obviously we see the strategic opportunities and what you're driving, but the market doesn't seem to do that. So are there other steps you can take in your minds to get that message across to the market? Beyond just buying back stock or beyond just explaining where you're going on the two divisions?\nBob Nardelli:  I think the only other thing I would add Gary, as you know, we are squarely on plan with almost close to $4 billion of CapEx back into our business. Carol mentioned over $700 million in the first quarter alone, about 90% of that was back into our retail business. We went out and borrowed $4 billion to make sure, and we took full advantage of probably one of the strongest balance sheets in retail.  We did leverage up, as Carol mentioned, over 20%. We were confident in going out and securing $4 billion to make the biggest and the most strategic acquisition with Hughes. We couldn't be more pleased, as Joe said, it closed in record time; the integration is off to a very good start.  I think certainly in the balance of the year and going forward we will look back and be very pleased with the fact that we're continuing to invest in the core. We're growing our service business. Our e-commerce business, as I mentioned will be $1 billion. It will double up again this year from last year. So I think this multi-pronged approach gives you a platform to handle a variety of economic situations.  Certainly to be able to handle some of the goes in's and goes out's from both a broad range from Do-It-Yourself to the Pro contractor, and I think that diversity should give tremendous comfort to our investors.\nCarol Tome: If I could add and Diane you can jump in here as well, Gary I think we love our retail sell side analysts and we love our retail investors, but we need to broaden our investor base. Now we are of size in Home Depot Supply where we can justify that. So you say, what can you do? Well, Diane and Joe are on the road meeting with new investors, people who before may not have even considered The Home Depot as an investment of choice because they didn't understand our trade distribution growth strategy. So I don't know if Diane you want to add to that.\n Diane Dayhoff: That is pretty succinct; the only one caveat that we have is that Joe actually has to pay attention to his business for a little bit. He has had a great start, but you will see us out there a lot more.\nGary Balter - CSFB:  Here is my follow-up on that HD Supply, you mentioned Carol, 18% core growth or organic growth or whatever the proper wording is, and 140 basis points in gross margin expansion. What was the expense side of that equation?\nCarol Tome: They also drove expense leverage in the businesses that we owned a year ago. As you would expect and as Joe has told you, when we acquire these companies we see lots of opportunities on the back office, if you will, to take out costs. So we saw expense leverage in those businesses.\nGary Balter - CSFB:  So we are looking at like 250 to 300 basis points in margin expansion in the quarter, in the organic part, is that the way to think about it?\nCarol Tome:  Yes, that is the way to think about it.\nGary Balter - CSFB:  Thank you very much.\nBob Nardelli: Gary, I would just say we are one quarter into this, and really one month of Hughes. But the fact is we're very pleased with the first quarter performance, the first month performance relative to what Joe shared with you as it would relate to the 2010 vision of growing and expanding margin in the supply business, and continuing to get the favorable leverage that we're seeing so far.  So I am very encouraged across our business. I think retail did a heck of a job in the face of some tough numbers. Whether it be service or E-commerce or supply, I think each segment is moving along extremely well.\nGary Balter - CSFB:  Thank you. I will just add one final thought from my point of view, levered up the way I see [inaudible] doing or Sears doing I am fine with that.\nCarol Tome:  Thanks, Gary.\nBob Nardelli:  I think we have time for a few more questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin McGranahan, Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Bernstein:  Good morning, Bob. I wanted to focus first on just the retail sales; I understand the weather was a little bit difficult. But if you look at the ticket growth of 4.3%, again you're facing some more difficult multi-year compares here, because I think you are really starting to see some very strong ticket growth kind of mid '03 on. But the weakest ticket growth in about 11 quarters, do you feel you're starting to anniversary enough that there is a limit to the amount the ticket can go up?  Is there any sense that maybe you pushed the prices in some categories a little bit above where the consumer is comfortable in the current environment, with high energy and high interest rate? Just to comment on how you're feeling about the ability to continue to grow ticket? Secondly on the retail sales, just in flooring again obviously understand why they are seasonal, but in flooring do you think some of that softness is related to housing turnover? Obviously that's a category that sees a lot of strength in hot housing markets where is a lot of speculative or flipping going on.\nBob Nardelli:  Colin let me first of all, let me address exactly your point. While we said some of the softness in the first quarter was weather, particularly as it relates to our biggest department given this time of year which is 28. But the other, as you accurately said, was flooring.  The short answer to your question about average ticket is, no. I really believe we have an infinite capability to continue to expand our average ticket. Let be also very quick to say, Colin, it is not pricing ourselves out of the market. Now while we've had some inflation in some commodities specifically like copper and gypsum, Tom and his team I think have done a superb job.  We have the most commanding assortment, for example in outdoor patio. We've had the most commanding assortment in grills where the functionality is more mirror imaging the capabilities of the indoor kitchen relative to burners, BTU's, etc. If you look at the tractor line-up and the fact that as Tom mentioned we think we have the broadest assortment; these are the things that are driving our average ticket.  We are pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter, and we think we have ample growth certainly through the balance of the year and beyond. We have over the last three years, as you know, we started talking about distinction and innovation, and through our innovation center and our merchants now we have a pretty good pipeline that will be rolling product out on a quarterly basis.  So as evidenced in some of the products whether it is Hampton Bay, Pegasus, Rigid, we are continuing to see unit growth opportunities. And I would certainly project that will continue the balance of the year and beyond. Tom you may put more color on it than me on that.\nTom Taylor: I think you answered it very well. I don't think that we're anywhere near where we can be an average ticket. I think our customers are continuing to upgrade and as we introduce innovation I think that our customers are accepting of that. We continue to see average ticket grow across multiple big ticket categories in the store.  We were soft in flooring and soft weather affected power equipment; those are two high ticket categories. So we are going to focus internally on flooring. We've got opportunities that we're working on and we're going to put some of our emphasis on resetting of the department in the flooring department. We are going to attack it from a product standpoint but there is multiple chains in the flooring purchase and we're not focused on one of them, we're focused on all of them.\nBob Nardelli: Colin, just to answer your final question, I would not attribute the flooring situation in the first quarter to housing, which would suggest a bigger economic issue for all of retail and in particular, home improvement. So I want to be very clear that there is no correlation there. We don't see any correlation relative to housing turnover and flooring in the first quarter for us.\nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: One quick follow-up for Joe or Carol, and obviously there is some strong commodity inflation; gypsum is up about 23%, plastic construction products about 21%. Of the 18% core organic growth, how much was commodity inflation?\nJoe DeAngelo:\nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: Finally just a comment I think it would be very helpful from my perspective if you did continue to report comparable store sales growth.\nCarol Tome:  Thanks for the feedback.\n Diane Dayhoff:  We have time for one more question.\nOperator: We will take our last question comes from Joe Feldman, Telsey Advisory Group.\nJoe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group: Good morning, guys. Thanks. I wanted to ask just for a little more detail on the resets that you're doing in the 500 stores; maybe just to get a little more color on what exactly you are doing and how long you plan them to take, if they're going to be disruptive, the cost involved, all that kind of good stuff.\nBob Nardelli:  In general, we will be a little guarded as you would appreciate from a competitive standpoint, to give you the specific resets that we'll be doing in the store. However, as Tom indicated, our plan today is to touch over 500 stores. We will be touching about 100 stores a month on average, and we will start that probably within the next 30 to 45 days. Tom, do you want to add more to that and Carol can reconfirm the numbers for you?\nTom Taylor:  The plan is to not make this disruptive. The plan is to start it, as Bob said, in the next 30 to 45 days. We will impact 100 days in the store as Bob said, we are not going to talk about what days those are; but we will impact 100 days. They were selected out of our top businesses, so we are putting the emphasis where we think it makes sense.\nCarol Tome: Relative to the cost its about $81 million in total, $55 million of capital, $26 million of expense and most of that will be borne in the third and fourth quarters of this year.\nJoe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group : Got it. One last follow-up; if you could give us any kind of update on China, if it is something you can talk about at this point, in terms of the stores and store rollout there?\nBob Nardelli:  Again on China I would just reconfirm that it is our area of focus for international expansion. Frank Blake and his team obviously, and the people we have on the ground over there, are very vigilant of opportunities. I don't feel any pressure to make a [dumb] deal, so we are continuing to look at it. We are committed to being in the retail business in China. But I really don't have anything that I can report at this time of a concrete nature other than to say it is still a primary focus, and we believe we will be in China.\nJoe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group :  Great, thanks and good luck with the quarter.\nBob Nardelli:  Diane, I will turn it back to you.\n Diane Dayhoff:  Thanks, everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator:  Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference.

These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now let me turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Blake - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. I believe we'll look back on 2007 as one of the most difficult years ever for The Home Depot ever financially, but I also believe we'll look back on it as one of the most important years for the long-term health of the business. On the financial side for the year, consolidated earnings per share declined 15% to $2.37. For our continuing operations, earnings per share were down 11% for the year. Our comp sales were negative 6.7%.  When we set our plan in the beginning of 2007, we thought that we'd see an improvement in the market by the fourth quarter. In fact, we saw conditions worsen. Markets that had been soft, like California, Florida and the Northeast, stayed soft, and markets that had been relatively strong, like the Southwest and Midwest, weakened. The fourth quarter was our worst comp performance this year at negative 8.3%.  But despite the difficulties in our market and the tough environment, I also believe 2007 has set the stage for the long-term health of the business. We are focused exclusively on our retail business. We set out our five priorities for investment in the retail business and committed resources to them, and they are the same priorities for 2008 and beyond - associate engagement, shopping environment, product availability, product excitement and Own the Pro. We have made significant progress on each.  On associate engagement, we realigned compensation and reward programs to ensure that our associates are being appropriately recognized. For example, despite the difficult second half, we had 50% more associates in success sharing than in 2006 and increased the average payout by almost 40%. Our objective is to once again set the standard for associate knowledge and customer service. It won't happen overnight, but we're taking the right steps.  In 2007, we hired over 2,500 master trade specialists - licensed plumbers and electricians - to work in our stores. We reintroduced Homer Badges to reward associates for great customer service. In 2008, we will be introducing a new TK Badge that will reward associates for developing enhanced product knowledge.  In 2008, we will also focus redeploying noncustomer facing expenses to selling hours, an initiative we call Aprons on the Floor. An example of this is that we are changing the way we handle freight in our lower-volume stores. In more than 1,100 stores, we are moving today receiving and inventory stocking in the early morning and late evening hours while the store is open. This increases our ability to staff more customer-facing hours and shift full-time associates to busier selling periods. Paul Raines and his Store Operations team have piloted and rolled out this major initiative in a fraction of the time that it would have taken in the past, a sign of both increased velocity of decision making and greater focus on regional implementation and ownership.  On shopping environment, in 2007 we completed an aggressive list of maintenance projects, with new lighting and basic cleanup activities for over half our stores, as well as more complex repair and maintenance activities for hundreds of other stores. In 2008, we will continue to invest at levels significantly above prior years. We now have an established programmatic maintenance cadence for our stores. We have also set out new store standards across the company that address the clutter we had allowed to develop over the years.  On product availability, Mark Holifield will discuss the progress we've made on our supply chain transformation. In 2007 we piloted a new distribution concept. We're pleased with the results, and in 2008 through 2010, we will roll out new distribution centers. It is our number one initiative for 2008 and will help us lower costs, increase asset efficiency and improve the customer experience. On product excitement, Craig will discuss some of the new products and activities that he and the Merchandising team are driving, but I'd like to give you a point of view on our merchandising organization that we haven't much discussed before. Those of you who followed The Home Depot for awhile know that the company made a significant move several years ago to centralize all of our Merchandising functions. At one point we had nine divisions, each with its own merchandising organization. Then a few years ago we consolidated all those organizations into one in Atlanta. That centralization had a number of very positive impacts, but it also created some issues and gaps in strategy and execution as merchants lost direct touch with their markets.  Throughout 2007, Craig and his team, along with Store Operations and supply chain, have worked to build basic processes to fill the gaps and fix the issues created by the centralization. We're well along in the process. We'll continue in 2008. This work is critical for our performance in 2008 and will also position us for successful implementation of core retail. On that point, we begin to pilot our new ERP system in Canada this spring. Once out of pilot, we will roll the new platform to all Canadian stores and expect to be fully operational there with the new system by the end of the year. On our Own the Pro initiative, we have grown our bid room volume by over 200% this year, and in 2008 we will continue to leverage our customer analytics to drive a deeper relationship with these valuable customers.  Finally, our international businesses performed very well in 2007. We are the market leader in both Mexico and Canada. Mexico posted double-digit comps for the year, Canada had positive comps, and China has posted positive comps since we re-branded our stores last summer. On all of our initiatives, we are proud of what we have accomplished but realistic about all the work we have left to do. We have improved our voice of customer scores, but we are still too often perceived as lagging in customer service, and we know that in a down market, we have to work all the harder to earn our customers' confidence. So as we look at 2008, we know that we have to continue to make investments in our business to drive our key priorities. We also know that we have to stop doing some things. We should be judged by the discipline we bring to executing on our key priorities and the discipline we bring to stepping away from activities that aren't priorities. Chief among the activities we are downsizing is new store growth. We will open about 55 new stores in 2008, of which only about 35 will be in the United States. We expect 2008 to be another challenging year in terms of the housing and home improvement markets. There is a substantial inventory of houses for sale, continued pressure on housing prices, uncertainties around credit availability, and concerns around the overall economy beyond the housing sector.  Throughout this year I have referenced the data on private residential construction as a percent of GDP. At this time last year it had fallen from 6.3% at the beginning of 2006 to 5.3%. The 60year average is 4.8%, which suggested that there was still room for the market to fall, and it did. It dropped another 110 basis points and now stands at 4.2%. So we are now below the historic mean. We probably still have room to go, and the historic troughs in this indicator suggest that is the case. But this gives us at least some cause for cautious optimism as we look out through 2008 and into 2009.  Carol will cover our 2008 guidance in more detail in a few minutes, but in summary, we expect continued negative comps in 2008, with sales decreasing 4% to 5% as compared to last year. We also expect negative comps in the mid to high single-digit range.  Since, as Carol has described, every point of negative comp drives about 20 basis points in operating profit deterioration and since we expect continued cost impacts from our private label credit card, our earnings per share will decline by approximately 19% to 24%.  I'd like to go back to a comment I made on my first earnings call a year ago. The Home Depot is a company built on a strong set of core values. We have hundreds of thousands of associates who understand those values, believe them and live them. They make a difference for our customers, for our communities and for each other every day. They love solving problems. They are passionate about helping others. I want to thank them for their dedication and hard work. They make this a truly special company. Now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear - Executive Vice President Merchandising: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Our Merchandising departmental sales reflect the softness in the home improvement market. For the year, every department experienced flat to negative sales growth compared to 2006, with those categories most closely associated with construction - like lumber, building materials, electrical and millwork - posting double-digit negative declines. In the fourth quarter, we experienced negative sales growth in all departments except one. The department that outperformed the company's average comp were Seasonal, Plumbing, Paint and Hardware. The one department that experienced positive comp sales was Seasonal, driven by strong performance in Holiday, Fireplace, and Chemicals. Flooring performed at the company average. The weakness in the quarter came from continued softness in big-ticket and construction categories. January was particularly soft. The pros went home for the holiday and didn't come back until the latter part of the month. Special order Kitchens, Windows, Roofing and Madic Fasteners all had double-digit sales declines across all regions in the country except the Southwest. Additionally, we saw continued commodity deflation which impacted Lumber and Building Material categories like Dimensional Lumber and Gypsum. The combination of softness in the big ticket and commodity deflation negatively impacted average ticket, which was down 2.3% from last year to $54.96.  While we saw pressure across the store, there was relative strength in Repair and Remodel categories. Fasteners, builder's hardware, plumbing repair, pipe, along with the associated tools needed to make repairs, performed above the company's average comp in all regions except the hardest hit areas of California, Florida and portions of the Northeast. We saw strength in seasonal categories. Fireplace, Heaters, Power Equipment posted positive comps for the quarter in every region of the country except the more temperate climates such as in California and Florida. Additionally, Holiday posted double-digit comps across the country as a result of our enhanced assortment and increased values for our customers. I've shared with you throughout the year that we're focused on merchandising fundamentals. While some of my comments will seem obvious, let me tell you what's been done in 2007 and what my senior leadership team and I will continue to focus on in 2008.  First, to ensure that we are in touch with our customer's needs, every merchant is required to walk our stores at least one day a week. The objective is for our merchants to use this time to speak with customers and associates to get direct feedback on their assortments and merchandising opportunities. Second, we have constructed a weekly meeting where merchandising leadership and our regional merchants, together with Operations and supply chain leadership discuss upcoming events and operational issues. This creates a sense of urgency, quickly resolving issues normally by the end of the day, and it creates a collaborative ownership of results.  Third, we asked our IT and finance teams to provide improved tools to help merchants more effectively do their job. We don't have time to wait for core retail, a multi-year initiative, to provide these merchandising tools. Our technology team delivered an enhanced assortment tool that makes it easier for our merchants to assort to a market and even down to a specific store.  They also provided a new forecasting tool. The new forecasting tool is essential because speed in decision making is more critical than ever in this business environment. Enhanced forecasting is particularly important in our seasonal businesses. We used this improved forecasting for spring planning and feel good about having the right amount of product in our stores for our customers at the right time. Fourth, I've asked our merchants to accelerate implementation of our focused bay approach, our belief that not all bays are created equal, which drives our investment decisions. In 2007, we exited Consumer Electronics. This year we plan to exit Pet and Halloween categories.  My team knows that they need to make the tough calls in driving resources back to core home improvement categories. Even within core home improvement categories, we need to accelerate decisions on line structure, introduction of innovative products, and communicating the value proposition to improve our assortment productivity.  These actions, along with other investments, have allowed us to narrow our share loss in 2007. Specifically, these actions have helped us drive improvements in several product categories, such as Power Tools, Soft Flooring, Paint and Seasonal.  While we have made progress in many product categories, there are still others where we continue to lose share, and this represents an opportunity for us going forward. For example, in 2008 we are confident that we will improve our business results in Lighting, Kitchens, Bath Fixtures and Hand Tools by focusing on the fundamentals and leveraging these new tools. Our suppliers are key partners and I know that we will always negotiate over price, but we are in this to drive business together and we are driving a more collaborative planning process, doing a better job of sharing information, and working together on product innovation. These merchandising processes and stronger, better partnerships better equip our merchants so that they can leverage our regional merchandising teams in the field and sharpen our local merchandising efforts. For spring, I have some great products that I'm really excited about. We have a new exclusive charbroil grill with infrared technology ensuring even cooking and the ability to sear or slow cook with a range of temperatures from 250 to 800 degrees. It's also energy efficient and self-cleaning, with a touch of a button. We are introducing new patio sets that bring affordable luxury to our customers. This year we introduced Thomasville to our line up, complimenting Hampton Bay, both of which are exclusive programs. Our sets start at $399 and include everything from rust-proof aluminium frames with hard surface tops to wicker and cast aluminium sets and indoor/outdoor wood. We are also introducing an electric start gas trimmer under our exclusive Ryobi brand. The new touch-start trimmer is a very innovative product, and it's the only gas trimmer sold in the United States that can be started with the push of a button as opposed to the standard pull cord.  Finally, I want to highlight our new fresh air paint from ICI, which is the only true VOC - or volatile organic compound - free paint in the market. It is a trend-forward color palette of 65 colors inspired from nature, and it is the one of the only paint products that is Greenguard certified. It's truly odor free, which makes painting a much more pleasant experience. 2008 is going to be tough, but we have a strong merchandising team that will remain focused on merchandising fundamentals and delivering long-term value for our customers. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Holifield, Senior Vice President Supply Chain: Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone. First, I'll walk you through our supply chain accomplishments this year and then I'll outline our plans for 2008. In 2007, we started transforming our supply chain so we could deliver on the priority of improved product availability or better in-stock for our customers. One of our first objectives was to complete a comprehensive review of our supply chain, its capabilities and its limitations.  In terms of capabilities, not too surprisingly we discovered that our biggest opportunity is to radically increase our central distribution penetration. This will allow us to manage our inventory much more effectively both for our regular replenishment inventory and for our seasonal and promotional products. The existing Home Depot supply chain worked great for high-volume stores, which had no trouble making frequent orders to vendors for direct-store delivery to allow them good in-stocks and inventory turnover. But in lower-volume stores, without an effective central distribution network, our store associates are forced every day to make the tough choice of being out of stock or overstocked due to vendor minimum order quantities, long lead times, and unreliable replenishment. Given this need for much more central distribution, we developed an end-state vision for what an ideal network would look like for The Home Depot in the United States. This distribution network strategy effort employed industry standard techniques to map and analyze all of our existing and forecasted network product flows all the way upstream from our suppliers and downstream to our stores and customers.  Through this effort, we developed an optimal distribution center network strategy model that we will continue to use to guide all of our network development decisions in the future. A few of the highlights about the optimal network strategy: Our goals are first, to move from a central distribution penetration of about 20% of product flow measured by cost of goods sold to about 75% of product flow. Second, to operate fast-flow distribution centers, with the capability to process faster-moving goods which we will call rapid-deployment centers or RDCs. The optimal distribution center, or DC network, would include more than 20 of these fast-flow RDC facilities. Optimally, more volume will pass through these fast-flow RDCs than through traditional DCs. Third, to operate lumber in bulk DCs along with traditional stockandpick DCs as we do today. So the biggest opportunity in front of us was to develop these RDCs and to move quickly as the gap from 20% of central distribution to 75% is obviously quite large.  Concurrent with our supply chain strategy efforts, having a general idea of where the end-state supply chain strategy would take us, we began to pilot these fast-flow capabilities in our existing distribution network. In late March of 2007 we kicked off an RDC pilot in Atlanta that included 67 Atlanta area stores and 20 vendors, converting part of an existing Home Depot operated DC in Braselton, Georgia to these fast-flow or RDC capabilities.  The results of the RDC pilot were better in-stock at the stores, reduced lead times, improved shipment integrity, and improved inventory turnover. We ramped up more stores and more vendors, and today the Atlanta area RDC served 99 stores and processes almost 100 Home Depot vendors' products through it. We continue to add vendors to the mix weekly. So we now have a DC network strategy, a proven concept of operations as its cornerstone, and we have begun to roll it out. Our second RDC was opened in Chicago in January, and we are ramping up volume there now. When we open an RDC, if there is a transit facility nearby - as in Chicago we will close it and incorporate those existing processes and freight flows into the new RDC.  The keys to executing this strategy are getting more RDC buildings open and operating effectively and on-boarding vendors to the program. We will have several more openings in 2008, and we have a major push on getting vendors on board. Our target is complete 2008 and enter 2009 with 40% of our U.S. stores receiving RDC service and 30% of those stores' product flow measured in cost of goods sold on the RDC program. To get to the 40% of stores targeted this corresponds to opening about six additional facilities this year, ending 2008 with about eight RDCs given that each facility will serve about 100 stores. Beyond 2008 we will continue to open RDCs until we have reached 100% of our U.S. stores. We will also continue to ramp up vendors through the RDCs, making progress toward the in-state goal of 75% central distribution. Keep in mind that while RDCs will ultimately make up about half of the total product flow, the 75% distribution target includes the existing lumber DCs and the traditional stockandpick DCs. We expect to complete our RDC rollout in 2010. At this point we estimate the required capital investment to be about $260 million through 2010. We will keep you posted as we progress on this very exciting initiative. We think that long term it means lower supply chain cost, better in-stocks and higher inventory turns. Another important objective in supply chain was to establish a world class team of supply chain professionals. I've been very pleased with the supply chain talent we have on board here at The Home Depot, and we have augmented that talent with some key leaders who will help us to deliver on our commitments. In addition to Mark Huffman, Vice President of Inventory Planning and Replenishment, and John Deaton, Vice President of Supply Chain Development, let me highlight a couple of leaders who have joined us recently and are already making big impacts. Charlie Armstrong is our VP of Distribution and joined us in October. Charlie has years of transformation experience in retail supply chain, working with Ward's, Melville, GARR Consulting Group, and others. Charlie is accountable for all DCs and their operations as we radically increase our central distribution capabilities and roll out the RDCs. Additionally, we hired a new VP of Transportation, Michelle Livingston, who also joined in October. Michelle is a lifelong transportation professional. She came to us from C&S Wholesale Grocers, a large distributor to over 2,000 retail stores. Prior to C&S, Michelle worked with J.C. Penny as Vice President of Transportation and was there during their retail transformation, so she also has experience with the scope of our effort. So in closing, we are very pleased with our progress and excited about 2008 and the future as we transform our supply chain to the benefit of our customers, associates and shareholders. And now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. There are a couple of items I'd like to mention before I cover our results. First, our fiscal year consisted of 53 weeks, so our fourth quarter results reflect 14 weeks of operations compared to 13 weeks last year.  Second, fiscal 2007 results include seven months of HD Supply as a discontinued operation. HD Supply operating results, including the impact of the sale of the business, are found on a line item entitled Earnings from Discontinued Operations. In the fourth quarter, sales were $17.7 billion, a 1.5% increase from last year. For the year, our sales declined by 2.1% to $77.3 billion.  The 14th week in the fourth quarter added approximately $1.1 billion in sales to the quarter and the year. Excluding the sales impacts of the extra week, our fourth quarter sales declined by 4.7% and our fiscal year sales declined by 3.5%.  We reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.40 in the quarter, down 4.8% from last year and for fiscal 2007, earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.27, down 11% from last year.  The extra week increased earnings per share by approximately $.04 for the quarter and the year.  Consistent with our guidance, the slowing housing environment significantly impacted our comp sales, which were a negative 8.3% for the quarter. Consolidated same-store sales were negative 6.6% in November, negative 7.2% in December, and negative 10.8% in January. We do not include the extra week in our comp calculation. For the year, comp sales were negative 6.7%. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 34.3%, an increase of 67 basis points from last year, reflecting 47 basis points of margin expansion due to lower deferred interest associated with our private label credit card, and 20 basis points of margin expansion due to a number of factors, including a change in the mix of products sold and less promotions in the quarter. For the year, our gross margin was 33.6% flat to last year.  In the fourth quarter, operating expenses increased by 197 basis points to 27.2% of sales. Our expense deleverage reflects the impact of negative sales, where for every point of negative comp we expect to deleverage expenses by about 20 basis points.  With a negative comp of roughly 8%, we would expect to report expense deleverage of 160 basis points. In the fourth quarter, we experienced an additional 37 basis points of expense deleverage due to several strategic business decisions, including the closing of our Tampa call center and write-offs associated with certain future store locations that we determined we will not open. Further, as we anticipated, the gain share from our private label credit card program was less in the fourth quarter than last year. The year-over-year decline in gain share is about equal to severance we paid out in the fourth quarter of 2006. For the year, operating expenses increased by 188 basis points to 24.3% of sales. Operating margin was 7.1% in the fourth quarter, down 130 basis points from last year. For fiscal 2007, operating margin was 9.4%, down 186 basis points compared to last year. Diluted shares for the fourth quarter were 1.68 billion shares compared to 2 billion shares last year. The reduction in outstanding shares is due to our share repurchase program and includes the tender offer we completed in September. Since our share repurchase program began in 2002, we have repurchased a total of 743 million shares or 31% of our outstanding shares. Moving to our operational metrics, during the fourth quarter we opened 26 new stores, including five relocations, for an ending store count of 2,234. At the end of the fourth quarter, selling square footage was 235 million, a 4.9% increase from last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot on a 14week basis were approximately $279 for the quarter, down 8.7% from last year, and for the year were $332, down roughly 7% from fiscal 2006. Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter retail inventory was $11.7 billion, up 4% from last year. On a per-store basis, inventory was flat to last year. Inventory turns were 4.2 times compared to 4.5 last year.  Computed on the average of beginning and ending, long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was approximately 14%, down 290 basis points from last year due to the decline in our operating profits. We ended the quarter with $44.3 billion in assets, including $457 million in cash and short-term investments. This is a decrease of approximately $160 million in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2006, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $6.2 billion, net proceeds from the sale of HD Supply of $8 billion, and commercial paper issuances of $1.7 billion offset by $10.8 billion paid for share repurchases, $3.6 billion of capital expenditures, and $1.7 billion of dividends.  As Frank mentioned, the home improvement market is very soft and it's difficult for us to know just where it will go in 2008. Our guidance reflects our best thinking at this point, and it's important to note that we have not factored into our thinking the impact of the economic stimulus package. We're going after our fair share, but we really don't know how the consumer is going to react in this environment. We've detailed our guidance in our press release, so let me just hit the high points.  From fiscal 2007 reported results, we expect fiscal 2008 sales to decline by 4% to 5%, with negative comps in the mid to high single digit area. In the first three weeks of fiscal 2008, we are seeing mid single-digit negative comps, consistent with our plan.  For the year, we expect to open 55 new stores.  For fiscal 2008, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations to decline by 19% to 24%. Included in our earnings per share guidance is our view that gross margin expansion will be flat to slightly positive and that our operating margin will decline by 170 to 210 basis points as we expect expense deleverage due to negative comp sales and expense pressure from our private label credit card program. Let me take a minute and comment on our private label credit card program. By way of background, we currently offer six products as part of our private label credit card portfolio which range from three consumer-oriented cards to three cards that serve our professional contractors.  As of the end of fiscal 2007, almost 30% of all sales tendered were tendered through the use of our private label cards. The cards are offered and administrated by a third party in a program that includes a profit sharing provision.  There are three main components of the program that impact the earnings statement.  First, deferred interest - we are charged a flat fee which we call deferred interest every time a customer uses one of our deferred financing programs like No Interest, No Payment for Six Months. This flat fee is treated by us as a cost of goods sold.  Second, interchange - we are charged a fee each time our pros use their card. It's like an interchange fee for VISA or American Express, and we treat this charge as an operating expense. Third, gain share - this is our share of any profits in excess of a targeted turn. The portfolio has been much more profitable than the targeted return, so we've been enjoying a gain share which is treated as a reduction in operating expenses. The sum of all three totals the total cost of credit. Since 2004, the total cost of credit as a percent of credit sales has dropped by over 100 basis points, and in 2007 was less than 1% of private label credit sales. Under our credit agreement, the cost of credit can increase if the portfolio decreases in profitability. In fact, we project that the cost of credit will increase in 2008 and a major factor to this increase is less gain share due to higher losses in the portfolio. We believe the total cost of credit will reach 2% in 2008. While the year-over-year increase is large, 2% is in line with the cost of credit for traditional bank cards. Now moving to capital allocation, our capital spending plan for 2008 is $2.3 billion, down 32% from what we spent in the retail business last year, primarily due to lower new store openings. Approximately 50% of our capital spending plan is for new stores and the remainder will be used to invest in our existing stores in support of our key initiatives. Given that this is a transition year for our supply chain, we are not planning for any inventory turnover improvement, and given the sales environment, we may see slight deterioration in our turns. Finally, I want to give you our latest thinking on our recapitalization plan. In 2007, we completed almost 50% of our $22.5 billion recapitalization plan. Late last year, we put the recap on pause given market conditions. 2008 is going to be another challenging year, and we think the prudent thing to do is to keep the program on pause until we see stabilization in our business and the credit markets. So thank you for your participation in today's call, and Matt, we're ready and we'll be happy to take your questions.\nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Hi, thanks. Hey, I guess, Carol, first off, just in terms of the credit card, the 2% that the private label card will cost you in '08, I'm calculating that that's about $440 million or so. And I know you gave us what the numbers were for the second half of '07. Can you just give us what the - well, confirm if that absolute number is right and what the total increase will be year-over-year that you're projecting at this point?\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Steve, you're a little bit high on your analysis, and let me give you a bit more color on how to think about our private label credit card. There are three aspects of the program that impact the earnings statement. If you think about deferred interest, that is treated by us as a cost of goods sold. Your year-over change is going to be very little. In fact, we'll have fewer credit promotions days in 2008, and we expect very little change in the cost of deferred interest. As you come, then, to the selling and store operating expense line, clearly we'll have a lot less gain share than we had in 2007. I'm thinking that the amount of deleverage that we'll get year-over-year because of lower gain share is the amount of about 50 basis points.\nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Okay, so I just - so 50 basis points will be the portion within your selling and administrative expenses?\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. In the operating margin decline guidance that we gave of 170 to 210, there's as much as 50 related to the gain share.\nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Oh, okay. All right. Great, that helps. Now the second thing, you know, this quarter, you know, your comp gap with your competitor narrowed pretty nicely, and it looks like it was in the months - the last two months of the quarter. You know, are you - can you speak to that a little? I mean, is it, you know, maybe this quarter might have been kind of an anomaly, or do you really think that, you know, some of the cultural things and the things you're implementing at the store level are starting to gain traction relative to the marketplace?\nFrank Blake - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: You know, Steve, we - I guess the right way for us to think about it is not with respect to any one particular competitor but to think about it in terms of the market as a whole. As Craig said, we were pleased in some of the areas where we think we picked up share, but there are lots more opportunities out there for us to continue to gain share.\nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Okay, thanks. And last, a clarification point, if I could. Carol, the guidance for D&A, which I think you said is $1.9 billion, is that the D&A that's on the face of the P&L or is it the total depreciation and amortization that you disclose separately?\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: It's the total depreciation and amortization that we disclose separately.\nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Okay, so that's $1.9 billion compared with 1.82?\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: That's correct.\nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Okay. All right, great. Thank you.\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot and good morning. I'd like to focus today primarily on distribution. If you could talk about the decision to go with the RDCs versus other distribution alternatives, the stock and fixed DCs specifically, what the cost difference is, and just sort of the thought process beyond that call.\nMark Holifield, Senior Vice President Supply Chain: Yeah, Matt, it's Mark Holifield.  On the decision to go to fast-flow as opposed to stock-and-pick, what I would point out is that we do have stock-and-pick distribution centers today that we use primarily for import products but also for domestic products. So we had capabilities in that arena already. Given our gap of 20% to 75%, where we want to go, these fast-flow facilities are much simpler to set up, much smaller in general and much lower in capital investment, so we felt that this was the fastest way to make that acceleration from 20% to 75% central distribution penetration.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: And just one follow up - thank you for that, Mark - you know, Carol, you talked about the quarter-to-date same-store sales trends, you know, down mid-singles is a pretty sharp improvement from the numbers that you saw in January.  How would you characterize or what would you attribute it to, and how do you think about that in the context of your expectations for the rest of the year?\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Well, clearly we think the first half is going to be softer than the back half, as you can appreciate given the comps that we're up against. We did have a very, very strong President's Day weekend, and so that's obviously contributing to our year-to-date performance.  But as Craig pointed out in his comments, in January the pros - they went home for the holidays, and they just didn't come back. But we're starting to see them come back in our stores.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Fair enough. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Good morning. \nFrank Blake - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Morning.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Two things I'd love to get some guidance on. First of all, in terms of the delta in Capex, Frank or Carol, can you talk about where the investment is changing in '08 relative to '07? I know you that indicated that store openings is an important [inaudible] with that, but where else is there delta taking place there?\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. In 2008 we decided to spend $2.3 billion, which is down $1.1 billion from what we spent in the retail business in 2007. $900 million of that is directly related to new store openings, so that's the biggest change. The remainder decline is in areas where we spent money that we don't need to spend in 2008. For example, we put radio call boxes in our stores in 2007. We don't need to repeat that in 2008.  We're being very judicious on our merchandising resets. As Craig mentioned, we are accelerating merchandising resets that assist the product line review process, but for those major transformation resets, we're pulling back on those a bit because we think that makes the most sense for the business.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Great. And then secondly, for Craig, can you comment about what you're seeing in terms of sourcing costs, specifically your direct import program - if you're seeing the influence of Chinese inflation and how you can react or respond to that?\nCraig Menear - Executive Vice President Merchandising: Yeah, certainly, Eric. No question that there is cost pressure in the market as a result of the taxation change in China. We're working hard with our suppliers to try to offset those costs wherever possible. We have, you know, taken some and in other cases we've been able to work with them to offset costs and forego that. So there is pressure there, but at this point it's not something that we don't feel is unmanageable.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Great. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go to Danielle Fox with Merrill Lynch.\nDanielle Fox - Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about the financial impact from the rollout of this optimal supply chain strategy? Should it be earnings dilutive, neutral or accretive over, you know, the next few years? And on a related note, how do you manage the potential for disruption as you make major changes to your distribution network? Thanks.\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Danielle, on the financial impact, as you can appreciate, as we're rolling this out it will be earnings dilutive, and it's included in the guidance that we gave you for 2008. As Mark mentioned, we expect to be fully functioning in 2010, and that's when we'll see the economic benefit starting to flow through in terms of lower supply chain costs and higher inventory turns. On the disruption, we are planning for that. Mark, you might want to comment.\nMark Holifield, Senior Vice President Supply Chain: Yeah. I think we roll these out over the course of about three or four months as they open up and get to full volume. We have learned a lot from the Braselton test, and we learn each time we're going. You know, we're working very closely with the stores to ensure that our store partners understand the process. And, you know, I won't say we've perfected the program, but through the Braselton pilot, we've stumbled across just about everything we can stumble across and we believe we'll have a good rollout going forward.\nDanielle Fox - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Todd Duvick with Bank of America.\nTodd Duvick - Bank of America: Good morning. I had a quick question for you, and I appreciate the comments on the recapitalization program. I'm just wondering if you can tell us if that precludes any opportunistic share repurchases as we go throughout the year until you do feel the time is right for the recapitalization program?\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Well, what we've said all along is that we will use our excess cash to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. As you can see by looking at our balance sheet, we don't have any. We have $1.7 billion of outstanding commercial paper, and we need to run the business with about $500 to $1 billion of cash.  So we anticipate based on the guidance that we gave that we will be in the commercial paper market in 2008.\nTodd Duvick - Bank of America: Okay. But in terms of any large debt issuance, you're just going to kind of wait and see when the business improves, and following that, you're going to plan to finish the transformation program?\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, we are committed to the recapitalization program, but given our business as well as the conditions of the credit markets, we think it's prudent to pause.\nTodd Duvick - Bank of America: Okay. Thank you very much.\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.\nOperator: We'll go to David Schick with Stifel Nicolaus.\nDavid Schick - Stifel Nicolaus & Company: Hi. Good morning. A question, really, I guess for Mark.  If you think out maybe five years - and I know it's just 90 days of data on Braselton and Chicago - but you think about product costs and gross margin versus sort of inventory turns or driving comps or product availability, can you rank order that opportunity or at least, you know, talk about what's bigger and what's smaller in those opportunities?\nMark Holifield, Senior Vice President Supply Chain: Yeah. I would point out that we have almost a year of experience with the Braselton RDC. As I said, we opened that in late March of '07 so we've got a fair amount of information on that and experience with that. In terms of the business case for RDC, it's really based upon logistics costs, which we expect to lower through improved transportation and handling, improve inventory turnover through a better allocation process and lowering the lead time and the amount of time it takes for products to travel to stores from the vendors, and improved in-stocks leading to greater sales through the process of lowering the lead time and improving the responsiveness to inventory changes in the store. In rank order, it's kind of tough, I think. Logistics cost is very clear. You can measure that very clearly. Inventory turns, there's a whole lot of things that impact inventory turns, so it's a little bit tougher to point to a specific benefit there because there's a lot of moving parts; same thing with in-stock. But we do expect all three of those to improve greatly as we roll these out.\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: But if you love cash, one full turn improvement in inventory is over $1.5 billion of cash. So Mark, I don't know about you, but I'd put that high on the priority list.\nMark Holifield, Senior Vice President Supply Chain: Yes.\nDavid Schick - Stifel Nicolaus & Company: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: We'll go to Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions.  Carol, in the past you've given us the 5% change in sales begets a 10% change in EPS and the 20 basis points to operating margin for every 100 basis points of change in comps. Do those still hold? Do those still hold for the long term, with the exception of the credit cost issue that you had this year?\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Right. Excluding the private label card portfolio, we think our rule of thumb of 20 basis points of deleverage for every point of negative comp holds.  I think that would change in an environment if we were at pro-loan double-digit negative. We're not there. But clearly, we have minimum staffing levels in our stores that we need to be sensitive to.  But we've modeled this, and we're comfortable with the guidance that we've given.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay. And Mark, for you, I'm just a little confused on the difference between the fast-flow facilities of Braselton and what you had - I think you had 10 transit facilities that also served about 100 stores each, if I remember right - and can you give us a difference of what's - what's the difference between those two physically and maybe operationally?\nMark Holifield, Senior Vice President Supply Chain: Sure, Budd. The transit facilities, the easiest way to think about those is they're really more of an in-house LTL dock - a less than truckload freight handling dock.  We place an order that's a store-level order direct to the store, and it simply passes through the transit facility where it's aggregated with other store-level orders going direct to the store. So it's really - the easiest way to think about it is in-house LTL dock. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Right.\nMark Holifield, Senior Vice President Supply Chain: An RDC is different than that. We place a DC-level order, a single order, for the 100 stores, so we reduce the number of purchase orders that we send to the vendor by 99%, we reduce the number of orders that he has to pick by 99%, and we reduce the number of shipments by the same amount. So it's a single bulk shipment into the RDC, and at the RDC, then, we break that down by store and use the information we have on inventory at that point - what's needed in each store - to allocate what's needed to the store. So it's more handling in the RDC, but we gain benefit in terms of the in-stock and inventory turn. And as we roll vendors on this, we work with them to take the costs out that they're saving in terms of fewer orders to process.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Got you. Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll go to Chris Horvers with Bear Stearns.\nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Chris Horvers from Bear Stearns.\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Chris.\nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Stepping back on square footage growth, you cut back the growth this year. Can you talk about how you're thinking about longer term - what your longer-term square footage growth be, how many stores you might think about in 2009 and 2010, domestic versus international?\nFrank Blake - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Well, first let me take the domestic side, Chris.  You know, we've said for awhile that you should look at our new square footage growth as pretty much matching the market. And so obviously, as the market growth has come down, then our plans going forward on new square footage growth is coming down. So I would not expect, you know, at least within our planning horizon much change from what we're going to do in 2008 and if there were a change, it would probably be slightly decremented, not going up. Internationally, we continue to see opportunities in Mexico. You know, we really haven't even started to roll out China. We've stayed with the initial dozen stores from a year ago, just working through that business model. So we haven't really even put on the table yet what's a new store growth plan for China.\nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Okay. That's very helpful. Frank, in prior conference calls you've talked about your relative market share gain or loss versus the market and how you saw some improvement. I'm not sure if I missed it. Could you review that?\nFrank Blake - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, and I think Craig mentioned it just in passing. The way we look at is we think we've still lost share to the market. We think we've I don't want to do a double negative here, but we've reversed the rate of our decline, so it's improving. But we don't see in our performance now that we're picking up share to the market yet.  We feel like we're on that trajectory, but we're not there yet.\nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Do you have the '07 versus '06, what the numbers were by chance?\nFrank Blake - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: I don't off the top of my head.  And truly - we can get that back to you - ballpark, I'm remembering we've kind of cut it in half, the rate of decline, something like that.\nDiane Dayhoff - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations: Chris, this is Diane. I'll get back to you with that.\nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Okay. And then finally, Craig, can you talk a little bit about trends in the Appliance category? You didn't really call it out. How do you feel you're making progress there, and how do you look at that from a market share perspective?\nCraig Menear - Executive Vice President Merchandising: We improved our share in the quarter again from 10.8% to 11.8%. So we had a positive gain in the quarter. The industry in total is contracting, but we still feel that, you know, based on the share information, that our assortment and line up is something that the customer's responding very positively to.\nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Excellent. Thank you very much.\nDiane Dayhoff - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations: Matt, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Gregory Melich with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Hi, thanks. I had a couple questions. One, on the credit, Carol, you mentioned that you thought it was 50 bps of hit this year. Now is that where essentially it's no longer making money for you, or in '09, if credit continued to deteriorate, could it go further? In other words, how profit making is this credit overall?  And then a follow up on distribution.\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Well, remember, there's always a cost to credit. While we share in the profitability of credit, when you add it all up there's always a cost. The cost has been declining. It's now less than 1% of sales. It will increase, we believe, to 2% of sales. It all depends on the profitability of the portfolio. Could it go higher? Yes. It really depends on what happens within the portfolio. We have stress tested this and put it through the wringer, and we don't think it could get any higher than 4%. And we're certainly not predicting that. But, you know, we said bankruptcies jump and delinquencies increase and we stressed it and went into a prolonged recession scenario, and that's the output of that analysis.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: And that compares to the 2% you talked about this year?\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, 2% for 2008, yeah.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Right. And then the second is on distribution. Like, Mark, you gave the number of $200-some million for Capex. I assume you're - are you leasing these DCs, and if you are, what is the cost for that? What would be the implied cost?\nMark Holifield, Senior Vice President Supply Chain: Yeah. The number's $260 million. That does not include the land and equipment - excuse me, the land and building; we lease those. That includes our leasehold improvements and our systems that go into it.\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: The lease costs are included in the guidance that we gave you. As you can appreciate, the locations of these facilities are not the same as our stores, where we seek for A-related real estate. These are in C locations, so the rent expense is very reasonable.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay. So the number, you would say, if you were to add all those lease costs, it's not billions?\nCarol B. Tome - Chief Financial Officer: Oh, no, sir. No.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And on that, as you get these DCs rolled out, does it increase your likelihood and Frank, in terms of doing the stores three or four years from now to go into more rural markets or to do more in-fills, or is that really not the purpose of the exercise?\nFrank Blake - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: That isn't really the purpose of the exercise, but for sure it could be the case that our improved distribution network could facilitate different stores than we have now. But that really isn't the purpose, and that's not what we're looking to it to do.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thanks.\nDiane Dayhoff - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's call. Again, thank you for your participation.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factorsidentified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and ExchangeCommission. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane and good morning, everyone. Our marketcontinues to face into significant headwinds. We started the year with a fairlypessimistic view of the housing and home improvement markets. It turns out weweren\u2019t pessimistic enough. We had expected some market improvement by thethird quarter. That didn\u2019t occur and our results reflect the difficult market. Sales for the third quarter were $19 billion, down 3.5%.Comp sales were negative 6.2% and diluted earnings per share from our retailbusiness were down 9% at $0.59. We expect continued difficult conditions for the remainderof 2007 and into 2008. We have consistently used as a guidepost to marketconditions the ratio of residential construction spend to GDP. The 60-yearaverage is 4.8%. At the height of our market in 2005, the ratio was 6.25%. Themarket is now corrected to 4.5%. When you consider the GDP is approximately $14trillion, this represents a market contraction of over $240 billion. While we are now close to the average, we don\u2019t expect themarket do decline to the average and then pivot back up. We expect that thesoft market will continue, as reflected in the current overhang of housinginventory and the difficulties in the sub-prime mortgage [market]. As painful as the correction has been and will probablycontinue to be, we are now on the underside of this 60-year average. The valueof a time tested average is that it gives you confidence in the marketpotential ahead. For the Home Depot, it reinforces the importance of investingin our business and fixing our core operations. What most distinguishes the Home Depot is the culture of ourassociates, their passion for the company and customer service. As difficult asthe market is, it is great to see that passion reignited. We are achievingprogress from our investments in each of our five key priorities -- associateengagement, store environment, product availability, product excitement, andOwn the Pro. I\u2019ll provide a quick summary on each, but before doing that, let\u2019slook at overall market performance. We recognize that Home Depot's issues are not only marketrelated. We have also lost share through our own performance. One of our keyobjectives has been to reverse that market share loss. The latest data shows uslosing about 385 basis points to the market on a rolling 12-month basis. Thatis a significant improvement over last year\u2019s number of 760 basis points. Also, as Paul will detail, in the markets where the housingand home improvement markets have been more stable, we are seeing positive compperformance. On associate engagement, Paul will take you through what we\u2019vedone on our success sharing program, master trade specialists, and otherinitiatives. A good sign that we are seeing results here is that voluntaryhourly attrition is down 24%. We will continue to invest in our associatesbecause they are at the heart of our customer experience. On our shopping environment, we are rolling out new storestandards for cleanliness and appearance and we\u2019ve already seen significantimprovement in our voice of customer VOC scores. On product availability, with Mark Hollifield and team wehave improved our in-stock position in our stores and this is also reflected inour VOC results, which show an improved score in our find-and-buy metric. We also have a distribution pilot well underway. We took anexisting facility in Georgia, introduced new processes in technology and areseeing shortened lead times and better in-stock positions in the servicestores. Building out our new supply chain will be one of our most importantinitiatives through the remainder of 2007 and 2008. On product excitement, Craig will discuss the areas wherewe\u2019ve made significant share gains. We are also putting additional resourcesinto our regional merchandising efforts and adding talent to our merchandisingorganization. On our Own the Pro initiative, we are using the analyticsfrom Dunnhumby to gain better insights into the 2% of our customers who drivenearly 30% of our sales. Through these analytics, we are gaining a betterunderstanding of who these customers are and what their unique buying patternsarea. The analysis is being used to drive targeted direct mail pieces tooptimize our job lock quantity SKU lists, and to generate customer contactlists for our pro desk sales associates. I would also like to make a brief comment on core retail.We\u2019ve launched a program to transform our merchandising systems and processesand we are on track to deliver the first phase in Canada next year. Our international business remains strong. Mexico posteddouble-digit comps in the quarter, Canada had positive comps, and China ismaking good progress. Our international stores now contribute 9% of sales and11% of operating profit, an impressive record of performance for thesebusinesses. Finally, let me make a few comments about our sale of HDSupply and our recapitalization plan. We closed the sale on August 30th and weare now focused exclusively on our retail business. We used the proceeds fromthe supply sale to fund the bulk of our $10.7 billion tender offer, which wecompleted in early September. That completes about 50% of our recapitalization. Given the market environment now, both in the housing andhome improvement market and the credit market, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent torush to execute the remainder of the recapitalization, so this is not somethingthat will happen in the remainder of 2007. The basic principals behind the recapitalization that wewill be disciplined in our capital allocation and benchmark our use of capitalagainst returning dollars to our shareholders remain in place, as does ouroverall goal. We will provide a more complete view of our perspective on thisin 2008 inFebruary. In a meeting last week, one of our vendors made a greatcomment -- a downturn is a terrible opportunity to waste. This market downturnis an opportunity for the Home Depot to focus our resources and attention onthe things that matter and to bring greater customer focus to the business.That is what we are doing. Now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Frank and good morning, everyone. In the thirdquarter, we experienced negative sales growth in all of our departments exceptkitchens, which was driven by appliances. The departments that outperformed thecompany average comps were plumbing, kitchen and bath, garden, paint, andhardware. The departments that underperformed the company average comp werelumber, millwork, lighting, and building materials, and flooring performed at thecompany average. First let\u2019s talk about what negatively impacted us duringthe quarter, including regional differences in performance and later, we\u2019llhighlight some of the wins that we had in the quarter. A large driver of our weak sales performance in the quarterwas due to the softness in our building materials and related businesses. Lowerdemand, as well as commodity deflation in building material categories, such asdimensional lumber and drywall, impacted average ticket, which was down 1.5% fromlast year to $57.48. As you would expect, we are seeing double-digit declines inmarkets like South Florida, California, and portions of the Northeast. However,a few regions showed positive comps in these commodity related businesses, suchas the Southwest and Ohio Valley. The category where we lost share in the quarter waslighting. This is a product category that we have opportunity to enhance ourmerchandise offering and simplify the selection process for our customers. Herewe have promoted our top expo merchant, Lisa McLelland, to Merchandising VicePresident to lead this category going forward. She is leveraging the learningsfrom expo in fashion and design as the assortment is retooled for the spring of2008. Our kitchen category also remains challenged. In marketsfacing significant home price depreciation, such as Phoenix, Sacramento, andTampa, we are experiencing double-digit negative comps. Despite the headwindsthat we face in this big ticket category, we remain focused on improving our shareloss. We completed the rollout of our assembled kitchen cabinet program that wementioned last quarter and we are pleased with the early results. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are taking thelearnings from our success in the flooring department to our kitchen departmentand we will simplify the purchase process and increase the value propositionfor our customers. We are upgrading the shopping experience by resetting showrooms and enhancing the capability of our associates through additional trainingand technology upgrades. Now let\u2019s talk about some of the areas where we\u2019ve seenshare gains in the quarter -- paint, appliances, and power tools. Despite increasing competitive dynamics in the paintbusiness, our market share of paint grew again this quarter. We have a greatpartner in Masco with Behr Paint, which has been consistently rated number onein independent product testing for the past five years. Sales were particularly strong in our exterior paint andstain categories and customers are responding to the market-leading innovationand products such as our exclusive nano-guard exterior paint that requires nopriming. In a shrinking appliance market, we continued to gain sharethis quarter, building on the gains that we\u2019ve seen for the past few years. Wesaw significant strength in this category throughout the country. Our successhas been driven by our ability to stay relevant to our customers by providingthem with the latest features and benefits at great values. Customers continue to be pleased with the innovation, style,and design we are offering in appliances in products like the GE caf\u00e9 and theLG kitchen series, both high-end suites of kitchen appliances. Another area that is beginning to show positive shareresults is our hardware department. In power tools and accessories, we gainedshare in a shrinking market and extended our leadership in this category. Wesaw a strong performance across the country, including markets such as LosAngeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, San Francisco and Denver. We drove these share gains by staying relevant to both thepro and the do-it-yourself customer, providing them with tools that have thelatest functionality at great value. An example of this was our October launchof the new Ryobi One Plus lithium products, which offers professional featuresat affordable prices. A final comment on areas that we were pleased with in thethird quarter would be our merchandising resets. Where we have completed ourresets and implemented change from our product line review process,collectively these categories are outperforming the store sales performance inline with our expectations. There is no question that we are operating in challengingtimes, and as we look forward, we remain focused on our merchandisingfundamentals, enhancing our processes and strengthening our team. I have talkedto you in the past about our focused bay approach. The company transactionswere down 1.8% for the quarter. However, where we have applied our strategyagainst our specific category roles, we are beginning to see positive results.For example, in toolsets, whose intent is to drive traffic, we have seen thiscategory turn from a negative to a positive comp performance in the quarter. We are also partnering with our suppliers to bring value toour customers. Two weeks ago, we met with all of our top suppliers. We spent alot of time developing actions to more collaboratively solve customer problemsand drive sales for both of our companies. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we are pleasedwith the early sales of our holiday program and gift oriented products. Thisyear, we expanded and refined our assortment and expect to be the number fourretailer in U.S. holiday d\u00e9cor sales, with double-digit year-over-year growth. We are also focused on managing our seasonal categories,such as heating, snow removal, and organization. Before I turn it over to Paul, I want to mention someexciting changes in our merchandising organization. During the past quarter, wehave invested to add talent within the merchandising team at our senior level.Bruce Marino, a 23-year veteran of the Home Depot has come back tomerchandising after spending eight years as the Western Division President.Bruce is leading our field merchandising teams, merchandise serviceorganization, store environment, and new concepts. We also have three Senior Vice Presidents that areresponsible for our merchandising categories. Another former division Presidentand merchant, Eric Pederson, is our SVP running our building materialsbusinesses. Giles Bowman, who has held various merchandising positionsthroughout the organization, is our SVP for hard lines. And lastly, we are pleased that Gordie Erickson has joinedus as our SVP of D\u00e9cor. He brings a strong background of merchandising with 32years of experience in home center mass and specialty retailing. Now I would like to turn the call over to Paul.\nPaul Raines: Thank you, Craig. As Frank mentioned, we have seensignificant differences in regional performance, driven by macroeconomic trendsand housing indicators. In those markets with favorable housing trends andstrong disposable income, we are seeing positive comp performance. For example,in the Southwest, our Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio markets had positivecomps for the quarter. In those areas that have been the hardest hit by housingturnover and new home sales, we continue to feel significant pressure. It is nosurprise that Sacramento, Las Vegas, and Fort Myers, Naples fall in thiscategory, with Fort Myers Naples posting negative comps in excess of 20%. Our business displays significant variation acrossgeographies and that underscores the importance of having a local focus. Forexample, within our Ohio Valley region, we have relatively stable housingmarkets as well as markets with deteriorating housing indicators, both postingpositive comps for the third quarter. We believe that our performance in these markets is beingdriven by share gains, as well as our focus on our five priorities. Now let\u2019s talk about some of our progress on thosepriorities. This year, we have made a lot of progress on our associateengagement priority and despite the difficult business environment, we aredriving positive changes around our associate reward and recognition programs.We know that the motivation and engagement of our more than 300,000 associatesmake a huge impact on customer satisfaction and on sales. In our second quarter earnings call, we spoke a lot aboutcompensation enhancements. The changes in our success sharing program, anincentive program for hourly associates driven by individual store performance,allowed us to increase our associates participation in success sharing byalmost 40 points year over year for the first half. The largest check an hourlyassociated received was $1,855 and the average check was around $200. The issuance of restricted stock grants have more closelyaligned assistant store managers with the company\u2019s goals. We have also seenpositive results from the reinstitution of our Homer Badge program, whereassociates get rewarded with merit badges for outstanding customer service,which they can submit for cash compensation. To date, over 78,000 Homer Badges have been awarded,including seven gold level badges and two platinum level badges. We have also seen a big impact from our master tradespecialist program. As of last week, we had over 2,000 master trade specialistsin our stores, all being either licensed plumbers or electricians. We areextremely pleased with this program. These specialists are better able to helpcustomers with their plumbing and electrical projects, help train associates,and help us better assort stores to comply with local building codes andrequirements. Our merchant team is also leveraging these specialists byhaving regular conference calls to ensure we are adopting and changing ouroffering in stores to reflect the regional needs of the business. While we view this as an investment in the short-term, weare confident that longer term, we will see a return on this investment. We are seeing the impact of our focus on associateengagement through reduced turnover and our employer of choice survey. As Frankmentioned, voluntary hourly turnover in our stores is down 24% from last year.EOC results indicate that our initiatives in associate engagement are making ameaningful difference. Earlier this year, we surveyed almost 300,000 of ourassociates at both the stores and the store support centers. Our highest scoreswere in those areas that are the most difficult to change -- meaningful andchallenging work, inclusive culture, and work environment. We definitely have room for improvement, particularly inareas like communication and work schedule. We are pleased with the results andfeel we can make progress in the areas that need our attention the most. In terms of shopping environment, we are very pleased withour progress. As most of you know, the average age of our stores is aroundseven years old, a time when you really need to refurbish the stores tocontinue to drive sales. Therefore this year, we increased our maintenancebudget by 2.5 times our 2005 spend, geared at making the stores clean anduncluttered and inviting to our customers. We have integrated our field and store support center teamsto better align ourselves around the needs of the business, as well as adopteda programmatic approach to maintenance. To date, we have polished or spiffed 473 floors, striped1,038 parking lots, remodeled 172 restrooms and now have T5 lighting in 1,765stores. In addition to programmatic maintenance, our integratedfield and support center teams have rolled out store standards to all stores.Through a cross-functional approach, we developed and piloted our basicexpectations for stores and our goal is to drive a foundational level of storeappearance that is agreed upon by our merchants, operators and support teams. To do this, we\u2019ve set common guidelines on appearance andshopability and have created discipline around how the store support center directlyimpacts a store\u2019s environment. The standards provide guidance on things such as front apronmerchandising, wing stack usage, signage presentation, fixturing, and off-shelfproduct. This initiative helps reduce the amount of time our store manages spendon navigating some of these issues, removes unnecessary clutter from the aislesand implements a basic, consistent approach in terms of store appearance. Finally, on our Own the Pro initiative, you\u2019ve heard fromFrank that 2% of our customers drive almost 30% of our sales. Through Dunnhumbyand our credit card programs, we have good information about what this superpremium customer spends in our stores. Over the last quarter, this customer whotypically spends twice to three times as much as a regular customer, hascontinued to shop with us. We are now taking the next steps, building betterrelationships with them, communicating our value proposition, and staying relevant to them through our bid roomand job lot quantities programs, to continue to connect with them and gain agreater share of their wallet going forward. We know these initiatives are making a difference becauseour customers are telling us. Through our voice of customer survey, where wehear from over 200,000 customers a week, we see improvements in likelihood torecommend, find and buy, and our clean and uncluttered metrics. Clean anduncluttered, which measures the shopping environment, is improving faster thanall other metrics. Although we see good progress on our associate engagement,shopping environment, and Own the Pro initiatives, we know that continue toface market headwinds and challenges. Our success will be defined by ourability to remain focused on the fundamentals of the business during thisdifficult environment. I want to make a brief comment on the stores organization.Although Craig was able to lure veteran Western Division President Bruce Marinoaway to merchandising, we could not be happier for Bruce and look forward toworking with him closely going forward. We have replaced Bruce with Joe McFarland, who is our newPresident for the Western Division. Joe is a 16-year veteran with the HomeDepot, who has held various operating positions, including regional vicepresident, district manager, and store manager. I am very excited about havingJoe in this leadership position. One last comment before I turn it over to Carol; it isunfortunate when we face natural disasters but it is during times like thesethat our associates and customers need us the most. Taking care of thecommunity and each other in a disaster is one of the things Home Depot doesbest. During the recent wildfires in California, we saw thousandsof customers and associates evacuated from their homes and many lost theirhomes or sustained significant damage to them. In order to assist ourassociates and customers in need, the Home Depot kept stores open longer thanany other retailer in the area and donated palettes of water, flashlights andbatteries, air purifiers, gloves, and more. Beyond providing the necessaryproducts during this disaster relief effort, our associates also donated theirtime to help in any way needed -- at evacuation centers, building sifters,providing shelter for animals and hosting kids workshops. You can always count on Home Depot to stand tall in times ofneed for our customers and associates. I want to thank each and every one ofour associates for your commitment and sacrifice. You make us proud to wear theorange apron. Now I would like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tome: Thank you, Paul and hello, everyone. Before I discuss theresults of the quarter, let me remind you that our third quarter resultsinclude one month of HD Supply as a discontinued operation. As you review ourfinancial statements, please note that the operating results and earningsimpact of the sale of HD Supply are found in a one-line item on our incomestatement entitled earnings from discontinued operations. In the third quarter, sales were $18.96 billion, a 3.5%decrease from last year, reflecting negative same-store sales of 6.2%, offsetin part by sales from new and non-comp stores. Consolidated same-store saleswere negative 5% in August, negative 7.3% in September, and negative 6.3% inOctober. In the third quarter, our gross margin was 33.4%, a decreaseof 18 basis points from the same period last year. Contributing to theyear-over-year decrease in our gross margin rate were the following factors. As expected, our gross margin benefited from lower interestcosts associated with our private label credit card financing program. In thethird quarter, we realized 36 basis points of margin expansion due to lowerinterest costs. We gave up roughly 54 basis points of margin due to a higherpenetration of lower margin products like appliances, as well as markdownstaken to clear through some seasonal items like outdoor power equipment andgrills, and allow us to transition into new products, like assembled cabinetsand kitchen accessories. As a percent of sales, total expenses grew by 183 basispoints to 24.1%. Our expense deleverage reflects the impact of negative sales,where for every point of negative comp, we expect to deleverage expenses byabout 20 basis points. So with a negative comp of roughly 6%, we would expect toreport expense deleverage of 120 basis points. In the third quarter, weexperienced an additional roughly 60 basis points of expense deleverage due totwo main factors. First, during the quarter, we announced our plans to closeour 11 landscape supply locations. We recognized $25 million of expenseassociated with the store closings during the quarter. Second, we share in the profitability of our private labelcredit card portfolio through a gain share program. Private label credit salesmake up about 30% of our total sales. The portfolio remains very profitable butlosses within the portfolio are higher than they were one year ago. As aresult, our gain share was approximately $82 million less than last year. Our expenses reflect investments we are making in support ofour five key priorities. We continue to view payroll as an investment. As apercent of sales, total payroll increased by 51 basis points over last year,which includes investments in our master trade specialist program, as well asexpense associated with employee bonus programs like success sharing.Currently, 57% of our stores are eligible for success sharing compared to 22%last year. As a result of the factors I just mentioned, our operatingmargin declined from last year. Our operating margin for the third quarter was9.3% as compared to 11.3% last year. Net interest expense was $125 million inthe third quarter, up $33 million from last year, reflecting higher levels ofoutstanding indebtedness. In the third quarter, our income tax provision rate forcontinuing operations was 34.7% compared to 37.4% last year. In the thirdquarter, we reached agreement with tax authorities on several state and federaltax audits. As a result, we recognized a $35 million tax benefit in thequarter, as well as some related interest expense benefits. Earnings from continuing operations were $1.1 billion, ascompared to $1.3 billion last year, and continuing earnings per diluted sharewere $0.59, down 9.2% from last year. Diluted shares for the third quarter were1.815 billion shares compared to 2.05 billion shares last year. The reduction in outstanding shares is due to the sharerepurchase program we began in 2002, including the 289 million shares werepurchased in our recent tender offer. Through the end of the third quarter,we had repurchased a total of 743 million shares. Earnings for our discontinued operation, HD Supply, were $20million. Included in this quarter\u2019s results are the net after tax financialresults for the month of August, as well as the impact of the sale of HDSupply. After expenses and taxes, we recognized a $4 million loss on the saleof the business. Moving to our operational metrics, during the third quarterwe opened 25 new stores, including one relocated store, for an ending storecount of 2,224. Today, 236 stores representing approximately 11% of our storebase, operate in Canada, Mexico, and China. At the end of the third quarter, selling square footage was233 million, a 5.4% increase from last year. The average square footage perstore was 105,000 square feet, the same as last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per squarefoot were approximately $323 for the quarter, down 7.8% from last year. Whilethe year-over-year trends for our new stores were also negative, sales persquare foot for our new stores had their best year-over-year performance sincethe fourth quarter of 2006. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $12.6billion, an increase of 3.7% from last year. On a per store basis, inventorywas down 1.9% from last year. Inventory turns were 4.4 times, slightly lowerthan last year. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-termdebt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital forour retail business was 15%, reflecting a 130 basis point improvement from thesecond quarter of 2007. We ended the quarter with $45.5 billion in assets, including$550 million in cash and short-term investments. This is a decrease ofapproximately $64 million in cash from the end of fiscal 2006, reflecting cashgenerated by the business of approximately $5.8 billion, net proceeds from thesale of HD Supply of $8.3 billion, along with commercial paper issuances of$748 million, offset by $2.5 billion of capital expenditures, $325 million paidfor a minority interest in HD Supply, $1.3 billion of dividends paid, and $10.8billion paid for share repurchases. For the year, we now estimate our total capital spendingwill be approximately $3.9 billion. Given our performance to date and the softness we continueto project for the rest of 2007, we think our comps for the year will benegative 6% to 7%, and earnings per share from continuing operations on a52-week basis will be down as much as 11% from last year. Finally, I want to give you our latest thinking on thecompletion of our $22.5 billion recapitalization plan. As Frank mentioned,since we announced the plan in June, we have completed about 50% of our recap.As you know, both the credit market and the housing market have become moredifficult since June. We believe it is prudent to take a cautious stance withregard to the completion of the recap. We will move forward when we seeimprovement in both the home improvement and credit market, which we believewill not occur until some time in 2008. We will keep you appraised of our plans and during ourfourth quarter conference call, we will provide you with sales, earnings, andcapital spending guidance for fiscal 2008. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call and we arenow ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to Chris Horvers atBear Stearns.\nChris Horvers - BearStearns: Thank you and good morning, everybody. First question on therecap program, I think when we are out here speaking with investors and weunderstand being pushed back because of the credit market aspect but pushing itback because of the home improvement market, what do you say to people who turnand say well, if they are not interested in buying our stock, why should I?\nFrank Blake: I think again, as we\u2019ve said, it is looking at both marketsand saying what is the prudent thing for us to do for our shareholders. If yousaid all other things being equal, we were planning to go forward at the end ofthis year and then take another step in the spring, but all things reallyaren\u2019t equal, both in terms of the credit market and we do think it makes senseto look at the housing market and see what\u2019s happening in the housing marketbefore making another major commitment.\nChris Horvers - BearStearns: Could you just expand on that last part? Why would you belooking at the housing market?\nFrank Blake: I think again for us, we look at both what our projectionwas for the year, where it turned out, and we want to get a better sense of2008 and we are frankly just in the middle of the planning process around 2008.\nCarol B. Tome: Chris, you\u2019ll recall that from a capital strategyperspective, we have targeted an adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio of 2.5times, and so clearly the housing market will impact our adjusted EBITDAR, andso we are just working through our plans for 2008 and looking at that relativeto our financing plans.\nChris Horvers - BearStearns: One follow-up question, Carol; as we think about 2008, andunderstand you haven\u2019t given guidance yet, we know sales -- it\u2019s going to be atough environment and we had the second downturn in the housing. As we thinkabout the deleverage that might occur in \u201908, does the accelerated maintenanceand the additional store investment this year make the potential deleverageless next year for every 100 basis points of comp?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, it\u2019s a great question. We had some catch-up spendingin 2007, as we\u2019ve talked to you about. Again, we are not giving guidance todayfor 2008 because we are just building our plans. But as we look at our businessmodel, we believe that we will still, for every negative point of comp sales,deleverage expenses by 20 basis points. Then there will be some other goes-insand goes-outs that we\u2019ll talk to you about.\nChris Horvers - BearStearns: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll move to Deborah Weinswig at Citigroup.\nDeborah Weinswig -Citigroup: Good morning. Frank, I believe Carol had highlighted thefact that 57% of stores this year are eligible for success sharing versus 22% ayear ago. I would assume that that\u2019s very important for employee morale. Canyou talk about if you\u2019ve changed the target or how you\u2019ve gotten to a highernumber year over year, and just what it means for the employees?\nFrank Blake: Yes, we did change the targets, so previously we tended tohave a stretched target in order to get into success sharing, and then you hadto hit 100% of the target. So for this year, we changed that approach and madeit a percent of target and at the time, we were thinking the target we set outwas a very reasonable target, with again, the basic principal being we wantedour associates to feel the benefit of success sharing and then earn their wayup into additional dollars, rather than feeling demotivated from the start at atough plan that they didn\u2019t think they could achieve.\nDeborah Weinswig -Citigroup: Okay, and then last question, in terms of helping theassociates in a tough environment, are there any additional tools that you areproviding them with in store to help serve customers or help them upsell?\nPaul Raines: I\u2019ll take that one. There is a series of activities in thestores around learning that are very important. We\u2019ve spent a lot of timerefocusing in the first half of this year around in-the-aisle learning andemphasizing project and product knowledge versus the heavily e-learning focusthat we\u2019ve had previously. So that\u2019s one of the tools we\u2019ve given them. At the same time, we are doing a tremendous amount of focuson our VOC activities and giving them a lot of feedback and metrics around whatcustomers are saying about the business. So we feel that we are giving ourassociates a lot more tools around the customer and around product knowledgeand helping customers do projects in their homes through this first half.\nDeborah Weinswig -Citigroup: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And next we\u2019ll move to Stephen Chick with J.P. Morgan.\nJeff Wimmer - J.P.Morgan: This is actually Jeff Wimmer on behalf of Stephen Chick. Ihave a question about your guidance, if you could delve in a little bit moreabout that. It looks like sales remain relatively the same, in that high,mid-single digit range, but could you talk about the split between growth andSG&A deleverage? Are you still looking for up gross margins year over year?\nCarol B. Tome: Yes, year over year we are projecting slight marginexpansion. On the expense side, the expense deleverage that we saw in the thirdquarter will continue into the fourth quarter.\nJeff Wimmer - J.P.Morgan: Okay, and then I might have missed this because I got on thecall a little late, but did you give intra-quarter sales yet?\nCarol B. Tome: From a comp perspective?\nJeff Wimmer - J.P.Morgan: From a comp perspective, yes.\nCarol B. Tome: We sure did, and let me just tell you negative 5 in August, negative 7.3 in September, negative 6.3 in October.\nJeff Wimmer - J.P.Morgan: Okay, and then also, just thinking about going forward, youhave the $600 million reinvestment plan. Is this going to be somethingreoccurring next year? Will there be additional incremental investment as welook into \u201908?\nCarol B. Tome: At the beginning of the year, we said that we were investing$2.2 billion in support of our five key priorities, $1.6 billion for capital,$600 million of expense. Some of that expense was catch-up spending. We willcontinue to invest in the key priorities in 2008. Just to update the capital bit, we are going to spend thisyear we project about 1.3 against the original 1.6 target, but that\u2019s reallybecause of the sale of HD Supply.\nJeff Wimmer - J.P.Morgan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll move to Budd Bugatch at Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch -Raymond James: Good morning. Let me ask you a question -- my first questionreally goes to appliances. Can you update us where you are on share onappliances? I noticed in some stores maybe some additional square footagethrough the use of mezzanines. Is that prevalent in a number of stores?\nFrank Blake: Budd, that\u2019s a very limited pilot that we were running and Iwould not expect to see a lot more of those, but let me turn it over to Craigfor general comments on appliances.\nCraig Menear: For appliances overall, again we were pleased with theperformance there. We\u2019ve achieved a 12.4% penetration in terms of market shareversus 10.7 ayear ago, up again from Q2, which was at 11.7, so the customer really continuesto respond to the offering that the team has put together.\nBudd Bugatch -Raymond James: And Craig, those are unit shares?\nCraig Menear: Yes.\nBudd Bugatch -Raymond James: Okay, and if we could also, my last question is to talk alittle bit about any additional talent or what you see in the merchandisingorganization with Gordie\u2019s coming on board, or can you talk about maybe whatother needs you might have?\nCraig Menear: Well again, very excited to not only have Gordie on boardbut also to have Bruce join us, coming in from the field to help us reallycoordinate and connect with our regional team as we continue to try to drivethe regional assortment variations that we need across our business and getthat executed for the stores. And with Gordie joining us, again great retail talent. Ithink well respected in terms of his knowledge, both in mass discount andspecialty retailing and it\u2019s a super addition to our team. We feel very good about the overall team that we have inplace right now and looking forward to driving the business.\nBudd Bugatch -Raymond James: Okay, and Carol, could you just give us what the tax rate isgoing forward? Any more tax issues?\nCarol B. Tome: We project that the provision rate for the year will be36.5%.\nBudd Bugatch -Raymond James: Okay, that helps.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Matthew Fassler at Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - GoldmanSachs: Thanks a lot. Just a couple of quick questions here. Firstof all, the average ticket decline seemed to moderate a bit. If you could giveus any color on why you think that happened, be it mix or other factors. And then just by way of follow-up, Carol, on the recap,would you continue to expect to deploy free cash against buy-backs or would youhold off on that as well?\nFrank Blake: Craig, why don\u2019t you comment on the average ticket.\nCraig Menear: On average ticket overall, again what we saw there was someshift in mix that is impacting that business. When you look at what happened tothe lumber and building materials categories, as that relates to a largerrepair/remodel project overall, that certainly had an impact on the category. We did see some shifting and we are seeing withincategories, for example, in a little more discretionary spend categories likeoutdoor power equipment, we saw some shift down in the line, which impacted theticket in that category as well.\nCarol B. Tome: Just another comment on the ticket, if you look at just thesequential performance, Q3 to Q2, in Q3 we picked up $0.22 of average ticketgrowth because of an increased appliance penetration. We didn\u2019t have that samebenefit in the second quarter, so that\u2019s part of what you are seeing. And on the recap question, as Frank said in his comments, weremain committed to our capital allocation strategy where we will alwayscompare the use of excess cash, returning that to our shareholders versussomething else, and so yes, we\u2019ll remain committed to that.\nMatthew Fassler -Goldman Sachs: But just to clarify, to the extent that you are talkingabout holding off on the recap, you\u2019re talking about holding off borrowing moremoney to buy back stock, not the repurchase of stock in and of itself?\nCarol B. Tome: Right. Now remember, we have $748 million of outstandingcommercial paper, so we don\u2019t have excess cash as we are sitting today.\nMatthew Fassler -Goldman Sachs: Fair enough. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Danielle Fox at Merrill Lynch.\nDanielle Fox -Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Good morning. I guess just looking backhistorically, the retail business has had an operating margin as high as 11.8%,which is about 200 basis points above where you are tracking this year. I\u2019mwondering what needs to happen to get back up to those levels. Presumably youneed to return to positive comps, but do some of these supply chainenhancements that you are beginning also need to work out in order to return tothe 11.8%?\nFrank Blake: I think first, clearly positive comps, because that leverspositively versus the negative, the deleverage that we see now. And thensecond, you are exactly right in terms of improving. What we see is thesubstantial investment that we are going to make in our supply chain will helpus improve our operating margins, as will the merchandising transformationthat\u2019s really at the heart of core retail.\nDanielle Fox -Merrill Lynch: You don\u2019t see anything as having changed in the underlyingcost structure that would prevent you from returning to those levels, giventhat you did need to step up the P&L investing beginning in the second halfof \u201906?\nFrank Blake: No, I would say 11.8 is a long ways away, but we think thereis significant improvement from where we are.\nDanielle Fox -Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Gregory Melich at Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Melich -Morgan Stanley: Thanks. I have two questions; Frank, did we start on theCanadian rollout of the merchandising system that was mentioned as somethingthat will happen next year? Is that a pilot or is that across all the stores or-- just fill us in on the timing there.\nFrank Blake: The timing is around the end of March, the pilots will -- Imean, the way the actual rollout works is it starts with a set of pilot storesand you pilot that for several weeks and then fix any bumps that occurredduring the pilot process and then we expect to have it rolled out to everystore in Canada by the end of 2008.\nGregory Melich - MorganStanley: And if I remember correctly, there was a plan to maybeaccelerate the U.S. following that. Is that still the case? Or that will be a\u201909 business?\nFrank Blake: The way we are setting this up, and I think the tremendousadvantage that we have with Canada as our laboratory, in effect, is that we aregoing to look very closely at what the results are from Canada, both pilot androllout, and that\u2019s going to determine the pace that we take on the U.S. side.\nGregory Melich -Morgan Stanley: Okay, so stay tuned, basically.\nFrank Blake: Yes.\nGregory Melich -Morgan Stanley: Okay, and the second question, Carol, is a follow-up on theearnings share of the credit business. I think you said it was $83 million. DidI get that number right?\nCarol B. Tome: It\u2019s $82 million year over year.\nGregory Melich -Morgan Stanley: So was that -- but it was still profitable in the quarter?\nCarol B. Tome: Yes, it certainly is -- very profitable.\nGregory Melich -Morgan Stanley: And was that swing -- would you call that an ongoing --\nCarol B. Tome: Yes, you know --\nGregory Melich -Morgan Stanley: -- provision that you [unwound], effectively.\nCarol B. Tome: It\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s the loss piece of the portfolio.The portfolio is really a good portfolio. The losses have been running in the4%, 4.5% range. They\u2019ve popped up. We\u2019re now projecting they\u2019ll be in the 6%range which, relative to other credit card portfolios is not bad, but it\u2019shigher so it means the profitability isn\u2019t as large as it was, so we didn\u2019t getas much of a share gain in the quarter. And that pressure will continue intothe fourth quarter.\nGregory Melich -Morgan Stanley: Okay, so we think that 6% is now a good ongoing number thatwe should use?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, we\u2019re going to be watching it very, very carefully.Some other stats, just for your information, 65% of the portfolio has FICOscores greater than 650, so that\u2019s very high quality. But 17% of the portfoliohas FICO scores of less than 600, so we are going to be watching this verycarefully. I mean, the credit market is interesting in today\u2019s environment.\nGregory Melich -Morgan Stanley: And are you -- on the downside there, is there like astop-loss so to speak, that you share profits but is there a cap on that or no?\nCarol B. Tome: The profits that are share is over a threshold, over anearnings threshold. We\u2019ve got a long way to go before that would happen.\nGregory Melich -Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard at ClevelandResearch.\nEric Bosshard -Cleveland Research: Good morning. Two questions -- first of all, on the recap,is the -- waiting to see what you are going to do next year, is that based asmuch on uncertainty about the EBITDA of the business next year? Is that theprimary driver to how you are rethinking the pace of which you are going tomove on that?\nFrank Blake: Well, as both Carol and I said in our comments, it is boththings, both the credit markets and the underlying housing market. As Carolindicated, obviously the underlying housing market impacts our performance,which impacts our EBITDA which impacts our coverage. And for where we are now, I think it\u2019s worth pausing andrealizing look, the window has been closed on us, so we could not have been buyingeven if we had wanted to. The window is now open and you would say -- we\u2019d saylooking at our business and looking at the credit market that this is a time topause and make sure we\u2019ve got a pretty firm idea going forward before makingthat second and third steps in the recapitalization plan, which again, as Isaid in the initial comments, we remain committed to. It\u2019s really just aquestion of figuring out the right timing.\nCarol B. Tome: And we certainly have debt capacity. If you look at ouradjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the trailing 12 months, it\u2019s 1.9 times, sowe\u2019ve got debt capacity.\nEric Bosshard -Cleveland Research: Okay, and then secondly, understanding the uncertainty,you\u2019ve made the decision to move slower on the repurchase. I understand thatbut in terms of the capital and the sales investment that you are going to makein the business for next year, how are you thinking differently about that? Isthat a wait and see how sales are until you determine what you are going toinvest in the business? Or are you going to continue to make the investmentregardless of the sales environment?\nFrank Blake: We are continuing to make the investment in the business tomake the customer experience the best possible customer experience. I\u2019d saywhere there\u2019s an impact and where you\u2019ve already seen an impact this year is inour new store opening and taking down our new store opening, both for 2007, asCarol indicated, that reduced our CapEx for 2007 and into 2008.\nCarol B. Tome: And you\u2019ll recall, Eric, at the beginning of the year, wesaid we would spend $4.5 billion in capital. We are going to spend 3.9. Thatincludes about $200 million at supply, so in the retail business about 3.7 andthe delta from the beginning of the year is really new store capital.\nEric Bosshard -Cleveland Research: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Gary Balter at Credit Suisse.\nShannon Coyne -Credit Suisse: This is actually Shannon Coyne for Gary. I just had onequestion -- how much of the lower guidance is due to the reinvestment in thestores, or minimum labor standards that you\u2019ve put in place versus theworsening housing markets?\nCarol B. Tome: For the fourth quarter and full year, Shannon?\nShannon Coyne -Credit Suisse: Yes.\nCarol B. Tome: If we\u2019re looking at comps of negative 67%, earnings fromcontinuing operations, EPS down 11%, implied in that is expense deleveragealong the lines of what you saw in the third quarter, and gross marginexpansion. And the expense deleverage is just a factor of the negative compsthat we are projecting, the investment, and some continued pressure on credit.\nShannon Coyne -Credit Suisse: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll take a question from Colin McGranahan atBernstein.\nColin McGranahan -Sanford Bernstein: Good morning. I wanted to focus first on the expense line alittle bit. As I look at the expense dollars, year over year the growth rate ofthose dollars is about 4.1%, which is -- looks like a deceleration of about 100basis points from roughly 5% growth rate in the first half of the year. Givensuccess sharing dollars look like they were probably pretty consistent, youhave this $82 million negative year-over-year delta in the credit portfolio,square footage growth is pretty much the same at 5.4%, what was it that causedthe expense dollars to decelerate and where did you realize some expensesavings in the business?\nCarol B. Tome: We didn\u2019t call it out in our prepared remarks, but just likethe second quarter, we were actually under our expense plan in the third quarter.Every day we wake up and look at sales, we look at cash, and we look at wherewe control expenses so it doesn\u2019t impact the customer experience. And we\u2019ve hadgood expense control in areas like advertising. We might want to talk about payroll, it\u2019s our biggestexpense. On the payroll side, wages are up year over year. That\u2019s reflectingthe investments that we are making but as you would expect, we\u2019ve got anactivity-based labor model and the hours in the stores are actually lower thanthey were a year ago, as you would expect, because we have less activity in thestores. On the G&A side, we\u2019ve got unbelievable expense control.We\u2019re investing where we need to invest but where we can cut costs, we are.\nColin McGranahan -Sanford Bernstein: So were labor dollars then growing at a slower rate in thethird quarter than they were in the first half of the year?\nCarol B. Tome: They were.\nColin McGranahan -Sanford Bernstein: Okay, so that was a savings, then advertising is a savingsand just tightening the nuts on the G&A.\nCarol B. Tome: Yes. And still there are lots of other small goes-ins andgoes-outs, but yes, those are the big buckets.\nColin McGranahan -Sanford Bernstein: Okay, and is that 4% a reasonable pace going forward?Because it looks like that $82 million credit delta is probably recurring andgiven probably some stress levels of some of your larger pros that are sittingon those credit cards, that may actually be getting worse, not better.\nCarol B. Tome: Well, I think we\u2019ve given you pretty good guidance for theyear, so you can do the math.\nColin McGranahan -Sanford Bernstein: Okay, and then my second question just on traffic. Obviouslyticket improved sequentially a little bit. It looks like there was a prettysignificant deceleration in traffic. Would you peg any of that to kind ofseasonal variances and the drought conditions and thinks like that? Or was itjust general housing market?\nCraig Menear: Not really -- as we looked at the traffic, just let meaddress the drought question. We saw some impact in categories like live goods,pressure washers, and power equipment in the southeast area of the country. Itwasn\u2019t material overall in the quarter. We did take the opportunity to movesome power equipment into the southwest region of the country, which wasperforming extremely strong, and to make sure that we continued to leverage theopportunity in that business. But overall, I wouldn\u2019t say that weather was the impact tothe average ticket.\nColin McGranahan -Sanford Bernstein: To the traffic?\nCraig Menear: Or traffic, I\u2019m sorry, yes.\nColin McGranahan -Sanford Bernstein: Okay, great. Good luck, guys. Thanks.\nDiane Dayhoff: We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay, and we\u2019ll go to Brian Nagel at UBS.\nBrian Nagel - UBS: Good morning. A question on -- as we see the weakness in theU.S. dollar here, and [you are presumably] sourcing more products overseas,what impact has that or could that have upon your business or specific grossmargins in the coming quarters?\nCraig Menear: When we look at what\u2019s going on with the dollar right now,certainly there is some pressure out there but we are working hard with oursuppliers to really work through that pressure with them to find other waysthat we can work together to take mutual costs that we have out of our businessand really not let that impact the retail environment whatsoever, so we\u2019re notseeing a significant change overall.\nBrian Nagel - UBS: That\u2019s helpful, and then one very quick question; I noticedin the guidance, it seems like the benefit of that extra week from an EPSperspective change this time in your guidance. What explains that?\nCarol B. Tome: We tightened up our forecasts. We had carried over somecosts into that extra week that we didn\u2019t need to, and so we just have a betterforecast.\nBrian Nagel - UBS: Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much and good luck nextquarter.\nFrank Blake: Thank you all very much.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you for joining us and we look forward to the callnext quarter.\nOperator: And that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

As a reminder today's call is being recorded. Beginning today's discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. \nDiane Dayhoff: Good morning to everyone. Welcome to the Home Depot second quarter earnings conference call. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of the Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and Carol Tome, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services.  Following our prepared remarks the call will be open for analyst questions.

Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Now, let me turn the call over to Frank Blake. \nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that I realize that many of you want to know where we stand on the sale of our HD Supply business. Unfortunately, I have no new details to add. We remain in discussions with the buyers and I'm not in a position to answer the very reasonable questions you may have about what is the likely outcome.  What I can talk about this morning is the performance of our core retail business. Our market continues to be a challenging one. You are familiar with the statistics: housing starts are down 22%, existing home sales are down 12%, inventory of homes for sale is at 8.7 months -- a 15-year high -- and the home builder index is at 24%, a 16-year low. In addition, the issues around the subprime market continue to intensify and this is an important concern both for the financial markets generally and for housing specifically, since subprime mortgages accounted for 24% of the dollar volume in the mortgage market last year. So this is a difficult time and our performance reflects that.  Sales were $22.2 billion, down about 2% for the quarter. Comp sales were a negative 5.2%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were down 6% at $0.77. Despite the difficulties, there were some positive signs for us. First, on the comp sales side, we did see strength in regions of the country with our Southwestern and Ohio Valley markets posting positive comps. The second positive sign is that our transactions grew year-over-year. While we still had negative comp transactions, this was our best comp transaction performance in awhile. As Craig will review with you, we also believe that we gained share in some key product categories and for our overall market, we have reversed our market share loss; or in other words, we're not losing market share as fast as we were.  But as that last phrase indicates, we have a long way to go to get to where we need to be. We don't want to be losing less share; we want to be gaining share and outperforming our market, so we will continue to invest in our stores and in our associates to improve customer service. In addition, we'll continue to look for more cost effective and productive ways to manage non-customer facing activities.  Here is a quick update on the progress we've made on our five key priorities: We are restructuring the way our associates are compensated, recognized and rewarded to make it clear that taking care of our associates is one of the core values of the company. As an example, one program we restructured was success sharing, an incentive sharing for our hourly store associates driven by individual store performance. 74% of our stores or over 200,000 of our associates will receive a success sharing payout for the first half which compares to 33% of our stores or about 86,000 associates in the first half of last year. The payout on success sharing is nearly three times what it was last year. We want to recognize and reward our associates for the hard work they're doing and we believe this is contributing to the improvement we are seeing in associate retention.  We have picked up considerable momentum in our Master Trade Specialist Program and we now have over 700 licensed electricians and plumbers in our aisles. We've reallocated our resources, putting more at the division and regional levels and have pushed more decision-making closer to the customer to take greater advantage of unique regional opportunities across the country.  In our merchandising organization, we have created three new Senior Vice President positions reporting to Craig and have staffed two positions with Home Depot veterans and are conducting an internal and external search for a third, as well as another Senior Vice President position that's open in merchandising.  In our supply chain organization, Mark Holifield has added leaders with experience developing and implementing large scale retail systems and comprehensive retail supply chain strategies. We have dedicated a regional Vice President, a Merchandising Vice President, and a Logistics Vice President to our U.S. core retail project team to ensure this effort gets the focus that's required for successful implementation.  We are past the halfway mark for the year on planned maintenance projects such as restroom remodels, floor polishing, relamping and lot striping and these efforts are reflected in higher voice of customer scores compared to last year. For example, we've seen year-over-year improvement in our store environment, clear and uncluttered aisles as well as associate availability and likelihood to recommend scores.  Now let me address our international business. Our international businesses -- Canada, Mexico, and China -- performed well during the quarter. Our Canadian stores posted positive comps and our Mexican stores posted double-digit positive comps in the quarter. We've been in China less than a year and we continue to be excited about the opportunities this market presents.  Let me finish with this comment: the second quarter was more difficult than disappointing. As Carol will go through, our results for the most part were in line with our expectations. We expect continued difficult conditions in the back half of the year but our investments are not for the short term, they are for the long term health and growth of the business and we believe we are seeing signs of progress.  Now, let me turn the call over to Craig. \n Craig Menear: Thank you, Frank and good morning, everyone. While comp sales in the second quarter continued to be negatively impacted by the current housing environment, we have made progress in executing our merchandise strategy resulting in sequential year-over-year improvements in sales growth, gross margin expansion, and inventory velocity. In the second quarter, four departments outperformed the company's comp: garden, flooring, paint and plumbing. Six departments performed below the company's comp: hardware, lumber, kitchen/bath, lighting, building materials and millwork. Commodity deflation of lumber as well as softness in certain big ticket categories impacted average ticket which was down 2.8% from last year to $58.30. Over the past several years, we have seen a benefit from the sale of appliances in our average ticket. This quarter the average ticket benefit from appliances remained the same as last year.  Despite the challenging selling environment we made progress this quarter. Our comp transactions while down 2% were better than we've seen many years. Our total transactions were up 1%. We saw market share improvements in key areas resulting from the merchandise actions we've been taking in the most recent quarters. We have shared with you that we've been taking action to turn around our flooring business. Our merchandising team\u2019s efforts have started to gain traction as we saw market share gains in both hard and soft flooring in the second quarter.  For example, carpeting is an area where we gain share in a flat market by accelerating our product line review process and improving our assortment with the addition of 40 new styles, each offering 12 color choices. We also improve the overall shopping experience by enhancing our merchandising displays. Our investment in flooring displays and resets have made a positive impact on the customer\u2019s ability to shop this category. Finally, by creating a tighter association between our install services program, our merchandise and marketing we simplified the installation offers to our customers which drove sales and positive gross margin results.  Our market share of paint sales grew this quarter, primarily driven by innovation, seasonally relevant products like our exclusive Behr Nanoguard exterior paint that requires no priming. We believe this quarter\u2019s paint performance was supported by the positive customer response to the Behr Challenge marketing campaign where our customers were invited into our stores to compare Behr\u2019s outstanding performance and value to other brands. Behr has been consistently rated number one in independent product testing for the past four years.  As customers expand their homes into the backyard, outdoor living continues to be a major trend with patio and grills leading the way in bringing customers affordable luxury. We saw significant gains in grills this quarter driven by the success of the Charmglow brand. In patio, we expanded our assortment to focus alternative, casual seating groups, our selection in seating and tabletop dining sets helped cement our success this season. We gained significant market share in patio furniture and further extended our leadership in this category.  In a shrinking appliance market, we continue to gain share this quarter, building on the gains that we've seen for the last few years. Customers continue to be pleased with the innovation, style, and design we offer in appliances. Second quarter results were driven by sales of innovative washers, dryers and refrigerators such as the Maytag Bravo high efficiency top-load washers and matching dryers and the GE Adora refreshment center side by side refrigerator, both found exclusively at the Home Depot.  The professional customer remains a key focus for us. We're pleased with the quarter\u2019s market share results in areas like gypsum, windows, and power tools. Gains in the power tools are driven in part by the products such as the new Makita magnesium lightweight more powerful circular saw which was well received by our professional customers.  Our execution this spring led to good results in seasonal categories with particularly strong results in live goods. We're also pleased with our performance over key holidays like Memorial Day, 4th of July, and Father's Day where we had strong weekends.  We're making progress but we still have a lot of areas where we have opportunity. In the second quarter we lost share in kitchen and millwork and let me share with you some of the actions we're taking in these areas. We are in the midst of replacing the ready to assemble kitchen cabinets in most markets that we have carried this product for over 20 years. We accelerated the exit of this category by taking markdowns in the second quarter to bring a new line of assembled cabinets into the majority of our stores by the end of the third quarter. This product offering better address the needs of our pro and serious do-it-yourself customers than ready to assemble product. We will continue to offer ready to assemble cabinets in those markets where it remains important to our customers.  In millwork, we updated our door program by introducing new products at great prices and enhancing our regional mix. During the quarter we introduced a number of new wood grain collections and glass styles in our Feather River fiberglass door program. These additions continue to expand and update our fiberglass offering to show the latest trends and styles in decorative exterior doors.  Looking to the third quarter I'm really excited about the new products that you'll see in our stores. First, we'll continue to bring affordable luxury to our customers by introducing products such as our exclusive line of Arietta designer range hoods which offers the style and quality of premium brand designer hoods at half the price. In addition we're excited about our new LG Kitchen Series tat's being introduced right now. This is a high end suite of Kitchen Appliances that includes a steam dishwasher.  Second, we'll introduce several products that will bring Pro features to the do-it-yourselfers such as Home Life\u2019s lightweight backpack leaf blower. In door locks we'll introduce Kwikset smart key door locks that makes rekeying simple and easy for our homeowner. This exclusive launch will be great for our DIY and our Pro repair and maintenance customers.  In power tools, we will enhance our current line up of lithium ion products with new Black and Decker and Ryobi tool lines. The Black & Decker BDX lithium ion line offers great design features and value to the eco boomers who are just buying their first set of tools. Our current Ryobi One Plus assortment will be enhanced with lithium products that offer professional performance at outstanding values.  With products like these and our focus on executing merchandising fundamentals, we bring excitement to our stores and deliver greater value to our customers. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Carol. \n Carol Tome:  Thank you, Craig and hello, everyone. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, let me remind you that we are now reporting the results of HD Supply as a discontinued operation. Any reference we make to continuing operations is a reference to our retail business only, and as you review our financial statements, please note that the operating results of HD Supply are found in a one line item on the income statement entitled earnings from discontinued operations and HD Supply assets and liabilities are noted on our balance sheet as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations.  In the second quarter, sales were $22.2 billion, a 1.8% decrease from last year, reflecting negative same-store sales of 5.2% offset in part by sales from new and non-comp stores. Consolidated store sales were a negative 3.1% in May, negative 5.4% in June, and negative 6.8% in July, as we did not repeat last years highly promotional activity in July. Now, given the state of the home improvement market, we had planned for negative comp sales in the U.S. and our actual results were, for the most part, in line with our expectations. For our stores outside of the U.S., comps were positive. Now, one last comment about comps. For the first two weeks of August, our comps are running in the negative 3% area.  In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33.1%, an increase of 9 basis points from the same period last year. Contributing to the year-over-year increase in our gross margin were the following factors: first, as expected, our gross margin benefited from lower interest costs associated with our private label credit card financing program. In the second quarter, we realized 38 basis points of margin expansion due to lower interest cost. Second, on a net basis, we gave up roughly 16 basis points of this expansion due to a change in mix of products sold and markdowns taken to allow us to transition into new products, including the kitchen cabinet program that Craig mentioned. Finally, we experienced higher shrinkage than one year ago and this negatively impacted gross margin by about 13 basis points. While shrink was higher in the second quarter, it has since returned to the levels we experienced last year.  As a percent of sales, total expenses grew by 147 basis points to 21.6%. Our expense deleverage reflects the impact of negative sales where for every point of negative comp we expect to deleverage expenses by about 20 basis points. Our expenses also reflect investments we are making in support of our five key priorities. We continue to view payroll as an investment. As a percent of sales, total payroll increased by 79 basis points over last year. This reflects investment in store labor as well as the impact of our success sharing and other store bonus plans.  One last comment about expenses. While we are committed to our five key priorities, it doesn't mean we aren't taking action to control costs in this negative comp sales environment. In the second quarter, our expenses were approximately $140 million less than our plan. As a result of the factors I just mentioned, our operating margin for the second quarter was 11.5%, down 137 basis points from last year.  Net interest expense was $145 million in the second quarter, up $47 million from last year, reflecting higher levels of outstanding indebtedness. Our long term debt to equity ratio at the end of the second quarter was approximately 43% compared to approximately 25% last year.  In the second quarter, our income tax provision rate for continuing operations was 36.9% compared to 39.6% last year. Last year\u2019s tax provision rate reflects the impact of an assessment we received from the Province of Quebec.  Earnings from continuing operations were $1.5 billion as compared to $1.7 billion last year and continuing earnings per diluted share were $0.77 down 6.1% from last year. Diluted shares for the second quarter were 1.97 billion shares compared to 2.1 billion shares last year. The reduction in outstanding shares is due to the share repurchase program we began in 2002. Through the end of the second quarter of 2007, we had repurchased a total of 454 million shares.  Earnings for our discontinued operation, HD Supply, were $66 million compared to $161 million last year. Included in this quarter\u2019s earnings is a discrete tax item of approximately $60 million arising from the timing of the sale of HD Supply. Excluding this discrete item, earnings from discontinued operations were approximately $126 million. The discrete tax item should reverse itself in the third quarter.  Moving to our operational metrics, during the second quarter we opened 33 new stores, including three relocations for an ending store count of 2,200 stores. Today, 232 stores representing approximately 11% of our store base operate in Canada, Mexico and China. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 230 million, a 5% increase from last year. The average square footage per store was 105,000 square feet, the same as last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot were approximately $383 for the quarter, down 6.9% from last year.  Now, turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $12.3 billion, an increase of $200 million or 1.6% from last year. On a per store basis, inventory was down 4% from last year. Inventory turns were 4.6 times, slightly lower than last year. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 15% as compared to 20.7% last year.  We ended the quarter with $56.9 billion in assets, including $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $2.4 billion in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2006, reflecting generated by the business of approximately $5 billion offset by $1.6 billion of consolidated capital expenditures, $886 million of dividends paid, and $91 million paid for share repurchases.  In closing, we believe that residential construction and the home improvement market will remain soft throughout 2007 and into 2008. We are committed to our reinvestment plans for the long term health of the business, understanding that it will put short-term pressure on earnings. We think our earnings per share from continuing operations on a 52 week basis will decline by 12% to 15% in fiscal 2007 with consolidated earnings per share down 15% to 18%. Our earnings per share guidance does not include the impact of the 53rd week, the impact of the sale of HD Supply or the impact of our outstanding tender offer.  Thank you for your participation in today's call. We are now ready for questions. \nOperator: Your first question comes from Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs. \n Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : I want to focus on the capital structure if I can. I know that you're not inclined to comment on the specifics about the sale of Supply, but you still have I would think a range of opportunities, perhaps depending on market conditions, perhaps not. Can you talk about your view and the board\u2019s view about the recap in general given the range of outcomes that you might see on Supply? \n Frank Blake:  What I'd say, Matt, is we remain committed to the recap strategy. Obviously, this is something we're going to do with our eyes open looking at the market conditions that we're facing in terms of timing, size, and the rest. \n Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs :  If the Supply deal were not to get done or not to get done in a timely fashion, would you be willing to do the tender? \n Frank Blake:  Well, I'm cautious on answering kind of hypothetical questions on this, as just to put the connection, maybe the easiest way is to give one overview comment. To put the connection between the Supply transaction and our recap and tender in perspective, what I'd say -- and this is an obvious comment and of course you all know it -- is that the $22.5 billion included $10.3 billion from Supply in it. So if you take the Supply transaction out, you've got a different recapitalization size and then you have to look at the tender as it relates to a portion of your recap strategy and that's basically what we would be weighing. \n Carol Tome: From a liquidity perspective, as you know we ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash, we have access to the A2 P2 commercial paper market and we do have a $10 billion bridge financing facility. \n Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : You talked about August comps to date, just looking at your last year\u2019s third quarter performance, August was actually your toughest compare. How should we think about the fact that business is tracking somewhat better in August? Any color you could give us there? \n Carol Tome:  Actually, Matt, let me just call out the comps last year by month. August was a negative 1.1, September was a negative 4.3, and October was a negative 8.7. \n Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : So to the extent that August is your toughest compare and you're doing somewhat better in the first couple weeks, it would sound like a pretty impressive performance. \n Frank Blake:  Matt, I just would add a caution that you have to look at last year\u2019s comp numbers because they were compared to the prior year\u2019s numbers which were so influenced by the hurricane impacts. So I'd like to reach exactly the same conclusion you're reaching but we're cautious on that as we see this unfold. \n Carol Tome:  Yes, let's look at the third quarter comps, negative 5.1 last year, positive 3.6 the prior year, a positive 4.5 the year before that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Budd Bugatch - Raymond James. \n Budd Bugatch - Raymond James:  Good morning as well. I'd like to just ask a question about gross margin. Carol, in your remarks you had talked about the July comparison being down 6.8 because you did not repeat the last year\u2019s promotional activity and yet when you went through the gross margin activity, gross margin results you were down 16 basis points for a combination of mix and markdowns and I would have thought if you had less promotional activity you might have actually seen a lift from that. Can you maybe parse out mix and markdowns and give us a feel of how that works out? \n Craig Menear: There's two things. As Carol mentioned number one, we were less aggressive in July from a promotional standpoint. We shared with you that in first quarter we were too aggressive and that we would relook at that in second quarter which we did. Secondly, as we continued to work our assortment strategies and continue to focus on our line structure, we are aggressively moving product out that isn't performing to the standard that we would like to see. Like we shared with you on the cabinet program, we made a decision to move quickly on that and accelerate the pace of the introduction of new product. \n Budd Bugatch - Raymond James: In cabinets you had made a comment, Craig, between assembled and RGA, and that the overall cabinet business looked like it was down and under performing. How did assembled do versus RGA? \n Craig Menear:  The assembled cabinets are performing very well as we get that into our stores. \n Budd Bugatch - Raymond James:  Frank, for you, my last question is talk about if -- and this is a hypothetical and I know you're going to love it -- if HD Supply is not sold for whatever reason, you had previously said that you wanted to integrate that into the stores as opposed to the silo type of strategy that was being employed before. Is that still your view or would you relook at that original thought process? \n Frank Blake:  The strategy, what I'd say, Budd is it is very important to me strategically that we think of ourselves as a retail business because the value in this business is the retail company. So assuming a world with Supply, we'll adjust but it will still be within the framework of the dominant focus of our company is going to be retail. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Seth Basham - Credit Suisse. \n Seth Basham - Credit Suisse: On the gross margin front again, is your guidance for the year still intact? \n Carol Tome:  Our guidance for slight margin expansion is still intact. \n Seth Basham - Credit Suisse: The reset cadence going forward, are you expecting less of a negative hit from markdowns related to resets? \n Carol Tome:  I think that as we look at our reset program going forward, we plan as part of that process for the change over and liquidation of inventory in that process and we expect that to be as we had planned it going forward. \n Seth Basham - Credit Suisse: Finally just related to the expenses in the quarter, can you give us some more color as to what beat your plan this quarter? I think you mentioned $140 million in difference? \n Carol Tome:  Yes, I can give you some color. We were laser focused on how we spend our advertising dollars and our advertising dollars came in under plan and our -- I'll call it our operations expense category -- lots of categories from the cost of the bags that you use when you check out at the register, and if you go line by line by line we were just really, really controlled. When you added it all up, it was about $140 million. I should point out in that $140 million that it was about $20 million less in depreciation and amortization than we had planned. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Chick \u2013 JP Morgan. \n Steve Chick - JP Morgan: Good quarter under the circumstances. If I could ask some follow-up questions on Supply. Based upon the data you gave, which was a little limited, I think EBIT for that business looks like it was about down year-over-year say $60 million and I was wondering if you could speak to what the sales trends were there and if it was margin versus sales?  Secondly, as it relates to your willingness to restructure the terms potentially, is it the performance of the business or is it the credit market that are factors there? \n Frank Blake:  Well, let me ask Carol to address the first and not surprisingly I'll pass on the second. \n Carol Tome:  Regarding HD Supply as you know, their business is heavily focused on residential construction and you know what's going on in the residential construction market. For the quarter, sales for HD Supply were down almost 7%, organic growth was down about 10%. Their gross margin did suffer some contraction in the quarter. They did a great job of controlling expenses in this environment but when you add it all up there was operating margin contraction. I should point out, as we look at it from a market share perspective, we see that they continue to do a very good job in share gains. It's just a tough market out there. \n Steve Chick - JP Morgan: Can you speak to maybe, Frank, what the timing would be in terms of when we might hear what the resolution is on that process? \n Frank Blake: Everything is better off with a fuller, freer discussion than we can have, but just genuinely these are issues in negotiation and I just wouldn't be comfortable talking about it. \n Steve Chick - JP Morgan: A second question if I could. CapEx guidance, it looks like you're back half weighted again this year for your cap spending. Is that still on track? I think your target is -- refresh my memory -- $4.5 billion and do you still planned on hitting that in the second half? \n Carol Tome:  Thank you for asking the question. This is the perfect opportunity to give clarity and update that guidance. We were looking at $4.5 billion at the beginning of the year, we're now looking at $4 billion. The delta is in two big buckets. The first bucket is HD Supply. We spent some capital for HD Supply for the first half but we're not planning to spend any capital for HD Supply in the back half so that's about $100 million. The rest all is related to the timing of new store capital. As we've looked at when we were going to pay for the purchase price of land, et cetera, some of that has gotten pushed off into 2008. So as it relates to the capital for our five key initiatives, we are spending and in the stores taking care of those five key priorities as we speak. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Colin McGranahan - Bernstein. \n Colin McGranahan - Bernstein: I was going to ask you what your reserve price on Supply was but I'm afraid I wouldn't get an answer to that. Seriously, I would like to focus on maybe the core retail implementation, and if I understand you're probably fairly close to the Canadian implementation. Could you give us a quick update on where you are in Canada, any changes versus the timeline you've laid out and just a general update on core retail? \n Frank Blake:  Absolutely, Colin, and actually Mark Holifield is in the room here so I will turn this over to Mark. \n Mark Holifield: Thanks, Frank. I'd say core retail is going very well with Score being our Canadian implementation there. In Canada we're in the very heavy lifting phase of this right now where we're really deep into the implementation process. We do still expect to pilot some stores in Canada this year and then rollout throughout 2008. We've accelerated since our business plan in 2007 originally did not include U.S. core retail. We've actually accelerated our efforts there and we're in the process of planning our U.S. core retail implementation with the folks that Frank talked about earlier.  Our EVP from Stores and Merchandise Vice President and Logistics Vice President all working together to make the plan for U.S. Core retail which will launch shortly after the heavy lifting efforts there. \n Colin McGranahan - Bernstein:  So Mark in Canada you're piloting a few stores this year. When would you expect to have Canada completely switched over to SAP? \n Mark Holifield:  In 2008. \n Colin McGranahan - Bernstein:  Just some time in 2008? \n Mark Holifield:  Yes. \n Colin McGranahan - Bernstein:  So if we can't find any hammers in Toronto at some point, we know it's switched? \n Frank Blake:  You'll find exactly the hammer you're looking for. \n Colin McGranahan - Bernstein:  Okay, good luck with that. Actually, Mark since I've got you on the line, can you talk at all about the logistics plan and any change there on how your strategy there is evolving as well? \n Mark Holifield: We're working against the plan that we've laid out previously and we're pleased with progress there. We've successfully hit some key milestones there on new systems and processes around Warehouse Management Systems and new distribution techniques, so we've hit key milestones also on our network planning effort and we've got the plans for the new DC facility openings through 2008 consistent with that plan. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank. \n Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank: Your SG&A sounds like you're in line with your plan but your SG&A was better than planned, so was there areas where you were disappointed, was it just the comps? Although it sounded like that was about what you expected. \n Carol Tome:  The comment about our performance in line with the most of our expectations starts with the sales. Our sales were very close to our plan. We continue to see weakness in areas like South Florida and in California. That's weaker than what we planned. You back those areas out and we would have been right on our plan, so that's really where my comments rested, I think as you go down the rest of the income statement we did a pretty good job as well. \n Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank: Is there more SG&A opportunity for some of the belt tightening that you talked about or is that something we should continue to expect? \n Frank Blake:  Look, we're always looking for opportunities to do things more effectively and more productively and we have those opportunities, so we'll continue to work on that. \n Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank: I'll take my shot at Home Depot Supply question. So in my mind, a tender in the Home Depot Supply were linked to the extent now that you can do the tender, you can buy the same number of shares for less amount of money. Does that make it easier for you to be able to accept less for the Home Depot Supply because again, in my mind, it was essentially trading Home Depot Supply for 250 million shares; or is that just too simple? \n Frank Blake:  It's not exactly how I'd say certainly I look at it. I look at Supply, as we've said right from the start, we're taking a look at creating shareholder value with our Supply transaction and what's the best way to do that. The linkage to how does that tie into the share price on the tender offer, I mean it's there but that is not what's in our line of sight. \n Carol Tome:  Supply was linked to the size of the recapitalization plan. \nOperator:  Next we'll move to Parham Behrooz - Evergreen Investments. \n Parham Behrooz - Evergreen Investments: I have a question on your debt funding. You seemed very confident you were going to be able to place a lot of debt after you placed a lot of debt last year, and then hit everybody with a four notch downgrade. Can you expand on how you're planning on placing debt, when you're planning on placing it, and any changes to the terms of existing debtholders? \n Carol Tome:  Well, it sounds like you may be a fixed income investor or an analyst and you know the debt capital markets better than we. They're extraordinary turbulent today. We're watching them very carefully. Our approach to raising capital is to be prudent and to be practical with everybody's interests at heart, so we have not clearly determined nor articulated when we will go to market, how we will go to market. We're looking at all of our opportunities. \n Parham Behrooz - Evergreen Investments:  So you don't want to expand on any of that today? \n Carol Tome:  I do not. As Frank said, there are some things we'll talk about today and some things we aren't. \n Parham Behrooz - Evergreen Investments:  When can we look for you to put a plan together? Because it seems like you have a plan together for the stockholders but you really don't for the debtholders. \n Carol Tome: We are thinking about our debtholders as stakeholders, very important to our company and our overall capital structure and as we continue to refine our plans we will certainly be articulating those plans. \nOperator: Your next question comes from David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus. \n David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus:  As we think about the existing home sales and obviously the pressure on the business and the way the consumer thinks about things differently and in the meantime, you've affected gross margin with some of the resets, et cetera. Forget this year, even maybe forget '08. Is the consumer, do you think, coming out or is this business coming out with anything different on what it should support from a gross margin perspective as you think about the elasticity that you see as you work some of these things through? \n Frank Blake:  Well, if I understand the question, let me take a general comment to that and then turn it to Craig. I think if you look at how our stores reflect some of the trends in the market and how people think about their homes, you can see it in things like the outdoor living that Craig was referencing, so now when you go into our stores you see an assortment around outdoor living for the home that frankly has opportunities for us on the gross margin side and I think is addressing what customers are interested in doing with their homes. I think you'll see that in other areas of the store as we build out our product mix. \n Craig Menear: Two other things that I would add-on and number one is as we continue to drive innovation, that certainly should help us drive not only top line sales but then the resulting gross margin dollars and then the second key thing that we have to stay focused on to continue to drive the gross margin dollars for the business is project selling, and as we stay focused on the overall line structure and selling projects, we can have a positive impact to the gross margin dollar generation. \n David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus: With the pressure you're seeing, there's nothing with the pressure we're seeing in the consumer to make you think five years from now gross margin should be lower in this industry than it is today, in fact perhaps higher based on things you can do? \n Carol Tome:  Oh, goodness if I could just jump in, if you think about what we're doing with core retail and logistics, our margins should grow through a cost out perspective. \n David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus:  I'm just trying to clarify sensitivity and elasticity. Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research. \n Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : The retail profit looked like it was down around 18% and your guidance for the full year suggests that you don't expect much of a change in the profit degradation in retail in the second half on a year-over-year basis, in other words down 18% first half, down 15% or 18% second half. The comparisons are a lot easier in the second half. Can you talk a little bit about why the rate of decline in retail is expected to continue to be at that level in the second half? \n Frank Blake:  Well, I think as I said, we continue to see some pressure ahead for us. If you were to ask in kind of a general perspective, the year-to-date in terms of the market I'd say has played out pretty close to our expectation. The first quarter we had some weather impacts but it was pretty close to what we expected. The second quarter has been pretty close to what we expected.  In terms of how we had developed our plans, we've had to adjust the third and fourth quarter are going to be more difficult, and frankly we're reflecting that additional difficulty that we see in the back half of the year, particularly as compared to last year. \n Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research :  Is that reflective of concern with sales or with spending or with gross margin? \n Frank Blake:  Sales. I think the key point there would be sales. \n Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : Secondly, you talk about this is the year where you are spending more money to drive share progress which you've done successfully. Can you talk about how you're thinking about balancing controlling expenses to generate earnings and with that investment, how are you thinking about that? \n Frank Blake: First the general point of view is we're investing in our stores. We want to see share gain because we think as the number one home improvement retailer we should be performing at our market and from where we are now, that implies improved share performance. But we're investing in our stores because our stores really require the investment to meet the customer expectation, and we start from that before we go to the is it a share gain play? Is it an expense improvement play? We've done a lot of work around what our customer expectations are and we know we just have to improve the shopability of our store and we know we have to invest to achieve that. \n Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research :  As you look at the second half plans at $140 million reduction in expenses in Q2, are we likely to see that follow through in the second half? Have you lowered the planned spending in the second half already at this point? \n Carol Tome:  We're looking at every expense item that we can control, but not diluting our focus on our five key priorities. I think what I'd ask you to do is just look at the guidance that we've given and expect us to deliver along that guidance. \n Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : Last question, Carol, on Supply. You've talked about your performance versus plan on a lot of categories. Can you talk about the Supply profit performance in the second quarter and how that related to the plan you had for the second quarter? \n Carol Tome:  I could, but given where we are, it's a discontinued operation and I think we've given enough color on the business. \nOperator:  We'll go next to Susan Hutman - Alliance Bernstein. \nSusan Hutman - Alliance Bernstein: My question is really for Carol. I just want to clarify an answer you gave to an earlier question. It was about whether the full tender would be completed even if Supply weren't sold and you made a strong point to note that you have CP access and bank availability. By my calculation, if you actually did completely debt finance the full $22.5 billion, your lease adjusted leverage would be four times which is way above your 2.5 times target.  At the recent Analyst meeting you stated your commitment to strong investment grade ratings and I would doubt at four times that you could hold your current high BBB which is already four notches below. Would you say that your view on ratings has changed relative to your strong view relating to the recap? \n Carol Tome:  No. Our view of ratings has not changed. We have a targeted adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. It's our intent to stay true to that ratio. Now it will go up and down each time you measure it every quarter but nothing is changed on the rating. My comment on the size of the recap at HD Supply is simply that we sized our recap based on $10.3 billion of anticipated proceeds from Supply and $12 billion of debt finance to be raised as soon as practical. If HD Supply, if we have no proceeds from HD Supply and I'm not saying that's the case but if that were to happen our recap would be reduced to $12 billion. \nOperator: Your final question comes from Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch. \n Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch :  Thanks, good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about what drove the sequential improvement in transactions and should we be reading transaction as the equivalent to traffic? It was a little bit surprising given that Carol, you mentioned one of the things, one of the areas where you found some savings was in advertising, so I'm wondering what you think drove the sequential improvement in the transaction count? \n Frank Blake: Danielle, first as an overall comment for the company and then turn to Craig and Carol, we had very strong performance in our garden and live goods, so when you think about transaction count and if you saw some of our stores, I think if you had the chance to walk them, I think you'd be very, very impressed this year with what we did in our D28 and I think that accounted for a lot of the transaction growth, just the performance of garden and live goods. \n Craig Menear: As we shared with you early on in the year, we were really focused on our focused bay approach and we had a roll on ten categories and we've been working hard to implement that and part of that as we shared with you there were traffic driving categories and certainly in our lawn and garden area that was one of them. I think the other piece of it is as we continue to work the merchandising strategy from our end, we're working very closely with Paul Reines and the operations team to make sure that we're doing everything we can to communicate to our store associates the advantages that we have in the marketplace and try to communicate that to our customers both through our marketing and through our associates on the floor, and I certainly think that's having a benefit as well. \n Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch : I know you mentioned where you were tracking in August. Carol, did you give us the monthly comps for this quarter? If I missed it I'll just go back through the transcript but I don't have that in my notes. \n Carol Tome:  For this quarter I did. I think I kind of stumbled through that description. Let me go through it one more time. May was negative 3.1%, June was a negative 5.4% and July was a negative 6.8%. \nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you to everyone who has joined us today and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Now, let me turn the call over to Frank Blake. \nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane and good morning, everyone. This was a difficult first quarter for us. Consolidated sales were $21.6 billion, up about 1%, but diluted earnings per share were down 24% at $0.53. Our retail business had a negative comp of 7.6% for the quarter and while we expected a tough quarter, this was worse than we anticipated.  There were a number of factors that contributed to our poor performance. The housing and home improvement markets were soft, and especially so in some of our traditionally strong markets in Florida and the Northeast. The weather was challenging as we had one of the coldest Aprils in more than a decade and finally, we continue to work through our own issues on performance and execution.  Let me give you a summary assessment of what has gone well in this first quarter and where some of our major opportunities and issues remain.  First, our associates have responded quickly and enthusiastically to the basic message that we are focusing on our retail business and reconnecting with the core values that are the foundation of the company. If anything, this has happened more rapidly than I anticipated and is a testament to the strength of the culture of this company and how deep-seated it is in our associates.  As Paul will describe, we have taken a number of actions to change the way our associates are compensated, recognized and rewarded to make it clear that taking care of our associates is one of the core values of the company.  We have also invested in associate hours on the store floor with a significant increase in payroll as a percent of sales. With this, we have rededicated ourselves to excellence in customer service and I hope you have seen some of that in our stores.  We remain committed to our strategy of investing in the retail business despite the challenging environment. We know that this put additional pressure on our earnings in this quarter but believe it was important for the long-term strength of our business.  Carol will take you through some of the specific drivers of the declines in our gross margin and operating profit performance. As a point of reference, we saw comp transaction declines of 15% to 20%-plus in our northern division and in parts of our southern division during two key weeks in April. It is difficult to make a timely adjustment for that level of decline. We did, however, see positive comp transactions of a similar magnitude this last week as spring arrived in the North.  We are making good progress on our programmatic maintenance efforts and are well on our way on planned projects such as restroom remodels, floor polishing, re-lamping and lot striping. Over 20% of our projects are in progress or complete.  We accelerated clearance mark-downs in the quarter in support of merchandising reset activities.  We are revamping our processes for connecting with smaller vendors with innovative products who in the past have found it difficult to deal with some of our bureaucracy and procedures.  We have taken early steps forward in our supply chain transformation. We have implemented enhancements to our replenishment systems. We successfully went live with our first distribution center conversion to the Manhattan Warehouse Management System, which will be our single state-of-the-art platform, and we have begun to pilot our new central distribution concepts.  We have also made significant improvements in the services we provide to our pro customers, particularly through our bid room. We have nearly tripled the volume of business that we do through our bid room.  We believe we have narrowed the gap between our performance and our market\u2019s performance, but we still have significant room to improve. Craig will describe for you some of the areas where we are seeing market share gains, as well as some of the areas where we continue to struggle.  We need to bring to every effort we undertake a consistent customer-based and store-based focus. This may sound obvious but there are worlds of differences between a program that works well in Atlanta and one that works well in the store, and we still have too many programs that aren\u2019t designed for effective implementation in our stores.  Now let me address our international retail business. Our international businesses, Canada, Mexico and China, performed well during the quarter. Canada\u2019s comps were above the U.S.\u2019 and the sales growth there was consistent with Canadian home improvement markets growth. Our Mexican stores continued to outperform the market, posting double-digit comps in the quarter, and our China stores are performing consistent with our integration plan.  Leaving retail and turning now to our supply business, sales were $3.1 billion, up 46% and operating profit was $163 million, up 9% for the quarter. Like our retail business, supplies results were impacted by the slowdown in the housing market during the quarter. As a result, organic sales declined 6.5%.  We continue to analyze strategic alternatives for the supply business. We are working as diligently as possible on this and we will update you as soon as the review is complete.  For the quarter ahead and the remainder of the year, we expect the U.S. home improvement market to remain challenging. One simple benchmark that we\u2019ve used is the percent of gross domestic product, GDP, represented by private residential investment. This number was as high as 6.3% in late 2005. It ended the first quarter of 2007 at 5%. The historic mean is around 4.8%.  Active mortgage equity withdrawals have declined significantly and housing inventory continues to build. So we continue to see headwinds in our market and are not planning for any near-term market improvement. We will, however, stay on strategy and invest in our five key priorities: associate engagement; product excitement; shopping environment; product availability; and own the pro.  At the end of this call, Carol will give you an update on our earnings guidance.  Now let me turn the call over to Craig. Craig. \nCraig Menear: Thank you, Frank and good morning, everybody. Comps in the first quarter were disappointing and less than what we had planned. Four departments performed above the company average -- electrical lighting, plumbing, garden, and appliances. Two departments performed around the company average -- paint and hardware. Five departments were below the average -- lumber, building materials, millwork, flooring, and kitchen and bath.  As Frank mentioned, there were some notable factors in this quarter that impacted our performance. Weather, commodity deflation, and a tough housing market, particularly in certain regional areas where we have significant business. This was partially offset by sharper focus on merchandising fundamentals and implementation.  We began the year in February with poor weather but bounced back with inline performance in March. However, the first two weeks of April brought with it unusually cold, snowy and wet weather that negatively impacted key seasonal and pro categories, particularly in the North. These two weeks of April happened to be some of the largest run-rate increase weeks in the quarter, so the timing of this weather impact was particularly difficult.  Falling lumber prices continued to negatively impact results. In the first quarter, lumber price deflation negatively impacted comps by 95 basis points. Lumber prices are at their lowest point in five years.  Existing and new home sales continued to be negative year over year, with some regions being affected more than others. For example, we experienced double-digit negative comps in South Florida and Boston due to slower sales in construction categories like windows and roofing.  Soft housing along with the weather negatively impacted customer transactions. Additionally, these conditions impacted our big ticket items such as soft flooring and special order kitchens. Consequently, the average ticket was down 2.9% from last year to $59.01.  Our gross margin rate in the first quarter reflects the acceleration of our merchandise strategy that we launched at the beginning of the year. We cleared out products to make room for new merchandising as we launched our enhanced product line review process. As an example, we accelerated the clearance in our wood and laminate categories as our stores implemented new resets in this area.  Additionally, our gross margin rate reflects an increase in sales penetration of lower margin items such as appliances, power equipment, water heaters and wire.  Finally, with the current market environment and severe weather impact, we created three significant sales driving events in an effort to support top line sales in certain categories.  As part of our merchandise strategy, we told you that we would measure ourselves by our performance in market share improvement. We are seeing positive improvement in many of our product categories but we have a lot of work to do in others where we continue to lose share.  An example of where we are continuing to lose share is bath. To address this, we have begun to roll out bath showrooms in new stores and smaller showroom resets in existing stores. These design showrooms and resets improve product visibility, making it easier for our customers to shop. Additionally, we are adding exciting new bath products under our Pegasus brand name to all of our stores.  Other underperforming categories will be addressed throughout the year as we keep on our merchandise strategy.  We have shared with you in the past that we have challenges in flooring. While we continue to work on soft flooring, we have seen improvement in hard surface flooring, led by strong performance in wood flooring and ceramic tile, driven primarily by reset activity and new product assortments. Both of these categories saw an increase in market share.  We did see market share improvement on a rolling 12 month basis in several additional categories as we implemented our focused approach in assortment, presentation and value. These include categories of patio, outdoor power equipment, appliances, nursery, landscape, power tools and accessories.  In patio, we enhanced our offerings to reflect the changing trends in outdoor living. Customers also responded to the breadth of brand offering and the value in power tools and outdoor power equipment. Through our strong vendor partnerships, we have improved our execution, product quality and value proposition in landscape and nursery products.  Finally, we continued to have success in appliances during the quarter, gaining share for the fourth quarter in a row. I am proud that we were once again named Energy Star Retailer of the Year. This award was due in part to the Eco-Options program that we launched in the fourth quarter of last year. We continued our success of this program in the first quarter. Eco-Options is intended to educate our customers on ways to be more energy efficient. We gave away 1 million CFL bulbs on Earth Day, and the additional sales of CFLs led to strong positive comps in light bulbs.  Overall, customers responded positively to our 2,500 plus environmentally friendly Eco-Options products. We will continue to work on enhancing this program with additional products to drive sales throughout the year.  As we look to the second quarter, despite the tough market we believe our performance relative to the market will continue to improve as we proceed to execute our merchandise strategy. We are well-positioned in key seasonal categories, such as tractors, mowers, grills, patio and air conditioners, and we have new programs and products in place for key holidays, such as Memorial Day, Father\u2019s Day and the Fourth of July.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Paul. \nPaul Raines: Thank you, Craig and good morning, everyone. As many of you know, one of our key priorities is associate engagement. The store experience starts with how our associates are feeling about themselves and the company. This business has a high emotional content and morale and the emotional engagement with customers is vital to our success.  With over 364,000 associates, this is a challenge we continually face but in a short period of time, we\u2019ve made notable progress in associate morale. I am getting a lot more e-mails from customers wanting to tell me about their great experience at The Home Depot. It is evident that our associates are energized.  At our investor conference, we told you that we were going to make several investments. One was to deleverage payroll expense as a result of our associate engagement initiatives. We stayed true to that commitment in the first quarter.  We also shared with you that we reduced the number of metrics we hold store managers accountable for from 35 to eight. This has allowed store managers to remain focused on what\u2019s most important -- our customers.  We gave the stores a fun fund -- $3,000 that could be used at the store manager\u2019s discretion to pump up their associates. Since then, we have also done a number of other things. During the first quarter, we launched a program to hire master trade specialists, particularly certified plumbers and electricians. These specialists not only bring their experience and know-how to the store but they also transfer knowledge to other associates and help boost morale. While it is still early, we are pleased with this program.  We have changed our associates\u2019 compensation structure. One of the ways we reward our hourly associates for great performance is through success sharing, which was historically based on a store achieving 100% of its goals. This is not the market design so like many other retailers, we changed the threshold to 95%. Now, associates feel more empowered and motivated to reach these goals.  I am pleased to say that for the first quarter, over 65% of our stores are on target to achieve success sharing.  We also continued our Orange Juiced program and reintroduced merit badges, which we call the Homer badge. Our Homer badge program rewards associates for good performance or exceptional customer service. Once you attain three badges, you can exchange them for cash. You will soon begin to see the Homer badges on the aprons of your favorite associates across the country.  We have strengthened the role of the regional merchandise manager, or RMM, in the merchandising process to ensure we are meeting the local product needs of our customers. Before this change, the majority of merchandising decisions were centralized but today, RMMs are able to adapt to the needs of customers by regionally allocating inventory.  One of Home Depot's traditional strengths has been our ability to adapt to local needs and drive regional differentiation. We are returning to that core competence.  To own the pro, we are focused on a number of different initiatives to better service pros, drive sales and build loyalty. One which I am really excited about is the pro bid room. The pro bid room, which is now available in all of our stores, allows us to leverage the buying power of The Home Depot for the benefit of our pro customers. Our direct ship program allows us to have large orders delivered from our vendors to the customer\u2019s job site directly. This reduces handling, lead time and cost and builds loyalty with this important customer.  The pro bid room brings the power of The Home Depot to our customer\u2019s job site.  Another initiative that I\u2019m particularly excited about are managed accounts. We have identified our super premium customers, that 2% of customers that represents 30% of our sales. To better service these customers, we have begun adding more pro sales managers to strategic markets. Even though we are just starting to expand this program, accounts that are managed by a dedicated Home Depot pro sales manager spend 50% more than unmanaged accounts.  As Frank mentioned, we have also continued to invest in programmatic store maintenance. Year over year, our spending on maintenance for general repairs, lighting, painting and lot striping has more than doubled. And with all of these investments, we are starting to see results. Through our voice of the customer surveys, we hear from approximately 200,000 customers a week. Our latest results show that we are tracking above the year-ago period for all of our metrics, indicating increased satisfaction from those customers that shop in our stores and make a purchase.  We also know some customers have not shopped us recently so we are working hard to make their next experience a great one.  Although the progress we are making in the stores is not evident in our financial results today, our attrition rates are down. The morale in the stores has improved significantly and our voice of the customer scores tell us we are doing the right things for our associates and our customers.  I believe I have a good perspective on this. I have worked in the store support center and have also had key operational roles as RVP and Division President. I have a good understanding of the role that the store support center can play and the needs of the field, and can bridge those two.  The Home Depot is a large enterprise and our reputation has been built through millions of customer experiences on the floor of our stores. I am pleased to say that we are committed to enhancing that legacy one customer at a time.  I would now like to turn it over to Carol Tom\u00e9. \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Paul and hello, everyone. In the first quarter, our total company sales grew by 0.6% to $21.6 billion. We experienced sales growth of $977 million in our supply segment but a sales decline of $830 million in our retail segment.  Sales in the retail segment were $18.5 billion, a 4.3% decrease from last year, reflecting the impact of negative same-store sales of 7.6%, offset in part by sales from new stores.  Based on the slowing housing environment and tough year-over-year comparisons, we had planned for a negative comp of slightly over 5% for the quarter. What we didn\u2019t plan for was unseasonably cold and wet weather in April. The two coldest weeks in April accounted for two-thirds of the comp miss to our plan, and the miss was found in the Northern and Southern part of the country. Out west, where the sun was shining, our Western Division beat its sales plan for the quarter.  Same-store sales were negative 7.4% in February, negative 5% in March, and negative 9.3% in April. Now, while still negative, same-store sales have rebounded and for the first two weeks of the second quarter are in line with our expectation.  One more comment about retail sales -- while we missed our comp plan by more than 200 basis points, the market growth was down from what we expected by approximately 300 basis points, so we believe we performed better than the market in the first quarter.  As you heard from Frank, sales in the supply segment were $3.1 billion, up 45.8% from last year. We look at sales growth in this segment from an organic and an acquired perspective. Given the challenging residential construction market, organic sales declined by 6.5% in the first quarter.  Consolidated gross margin was 32.9%, a decrease of 80 basis points from the same period last year. Given the growth in our supply segment, we are experiencing a higher penetration of lower supply gross margin dollars. In the first quarter, approximately 12% of our gross margin dollars came from supply, as compared to 8% last year. 38 basis points of the consolidated gross margin decline in the first quarter was a result of a higher penetration of supply.  Supply\u2019s gross margin for the first quarter was 26.8%, down 94 basis points from the first quarter last year, the majority of which reflects a change in mix of businesses owned, namely Hughes Supply.  The remaining 42 basis points of contraction in our consolidated gross margin came from a decline in the retail gross margin. Retail\u2019s gross margin in the first quarter was 33.8%, down 47 basis points from last year.  At our February investor conference, we told you that we anticipated a gross margin benefit this year arising from lower interest costs associated with our private label credit card financing program. In the first quarter, we realized about 37 basis points of margin expansion from lower interest costs.  This benefit was offset by two main factors. First, as Frank and Craig mentioned, we elected to accelerate clearance mark-downs in support of our reset activity and our product line review. Clearance mark-downs costs us about 54 basis points in the quarter.  Second, we had a higher penetration of lower margin categories like appliances. This change in mix, along with the promotional activity that Craig mentioned, drove approximately 30 basis points of the year-over-year decline.  In the first quarter, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of sales increased by 199 basis points to 24.4%, consistent with our plan. We experienced expense deleverage in both the retail and supply segments.  As a percent of sales, total expenses in the retail segment grew by 217 basis points to 24.7%. This deleverage occurred across every major expense category in support of our five key priorities. For example, in addition to our recognition programs, we elected to keep associates on the floor of the store even though sales were softer than our plan. In the first quarter, total payroll as a percent of sales increased by 76 basis points from the prior year.  One last comment about expenses; while we will control expenses where we can, in a negative comp environment, it is very hard to leverage expenses. We believe that for every point of negative comp, we will deleverage expenses by about 20 basis points.  As a result of the factors I just mentioned, the operating margin in both our retail and supply segments declined from last year. On a consolidated basis, our operating margin for the first quarter was 8.5%, down 279 basis points from last year.  Net interest expense was $161 million in the first quarter, up $109 million from last year, reflecting higher levels of outstanding indebtedness. Our long-term debt-to-equity ratio at the end of the first quarter was approximately 45% compared to approximately 24% one year ago.  In the first quarter, our income tax provision rate was 37.5%.  Diluted shares for the first quarter were 2 billion shares compared to 2.1 billion shares last year. The reduction in outstanding shares is due to our share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares and cumulatively since 2002 when our share repurchase program began, we have repurchased 454 million shares and spent $16.5 billion under our $17.5 billion authorization.  Now, moving to our operational metrics, during the first quarter we opened 26 new stores, closed two floor stores, and relocated one store for an ending store count of 2,170 stores. Today, 230 stores representing approximately 11% of our store base, operate in Canada, Mexico and China.  At the end of the first quarter, selling retail square footage was $228 million, a 5.6% increase from last year. The average square footage per store was 105,000 square feet, the same as last year.  Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot were approximately $329 for the quarter, down 9.4% from last year. In the first quarter, our new stores were 64% as productive as our comp stores, down from 66% last year and this reflects our changing store base. Of the new stores that we opened over the last year, approximately 28% were in Canada, Mexico and China. Generally, these stores are less productive than U.S. stores.  Now, turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, total inventory was $14.4 billion, an increase of $1 billion, or 7.6%, from the first quarter last year. In the retail segment on a per store basis, retail inventory was up 0.2% from last year. Inventory is higher than we planned but that is because of the sales softness in April. Our inventory lumps are in seasonal categories and we have already seen inventory drop as seasonal sales have strengthened in May.  Consolidated inventory turns were 4.3 times, down from 4.6 times last year.  Beginning long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 16.5%, reflecting our retail operating performance and lower returns in our supply business.  We ended the quarter with $56 billion in assets, including $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2006, reflecting cash flow generated by the business of approximately $2.8 billion, offset by $696 million of capital expenditure, $443 million in dividends paid, $91 million spent for share repurchases, and $31 million paid for acquisitions.  As Frank mentioned, we believe the home improvement market will remain soft throughout 2007. We intend to continue our reinvestment plans for the long-term health of the business, understanding that it will put short-term pressure on earnings.  At the beginning of the year, we provided earnings guidance and said that our earnings per share on a 52-week basis would decline by 4% to 9% in fiscal 2007. Based on the drivers of our first quarter performance, we now believe we will be at the low end of our earnings guidance for the year.  Thank you for listening to today\u2019s call and we are now ready to take your questions. We are ready for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions)  We\u2019ll go first to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot and good morning. I want to focus first on supply margins, if you would. I think you spoke at your analyst meeting to slight operating margin expansion for that business for the year. I realize that Hughes had a dilutive impact on the margins but you did own it for part of the first quarter last year, so as you think about the earnings outlook for that piece of the business, would you say that it has perhaps come down from where you were at the outset of the year? \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Good morning, Matt. Supply\u2019s gross margin dropped 94 basis points in the first quarter from last year. 75 basis points of that was directly attributable to Hughes Supply. Last year, we had Hughes in for one month of the quarter. This year we had Hughes in for three months of the quarter. Based on the guidance that we gave at our February investor conference, despite the fact that the residential construction market is challenging, we still feel comfortable about the guidance that we\u2019ve given. \nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs: And that has, that performance is not an issue as you look at the strategic review? Does the first quarter number if you will from supply impact the progress of that process? \nFrank Blake: I think we are pleased with the performance of the supply business, again recognizing that they face some of the same issues in the housing market that you are all familiar with. \nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs: And just for a quick follow-up, the share repurchase number I guess was a much slower run-rate than we have typically seen, though obviously we are still early in the year. How should we think about that $90 million spent on repurchases and think about the outlook for buy-backs for the rest of the year? \nFrank Blake: I think generally, we\u2019ve said we are going to wait until the end of our strategic review process with supply and then come out with a more general framework around what we are going to do on capital and our share repurchases. \nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Fair enough. Thank you so much. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go now to Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Thank you. Frank, first of all, I just want to say that just visiting stores, you see such a difference in the employees so whatever you are doing, keep it up. \nFrank Blake: Thank you, Gary. It\u2019s a lot of people other than I, obviously. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Yes, it\u2019s the whole team but you can see the difference. A question for you -- that wasn\u2019t a question, so I still get my two, but a question for you; at the conference in February, you talked about operating margins going from 11.4 to 11.9 at retail between \u201906 and 2010. It looks like this year is going to come in maybe 10-ish, 10.2, somewhere in that range. Are you still comfortable as you look out to 2010 that you could turn it around that rapidly, given the investments you need and given what you are seeing already? \nFrank Blake: I think, as we talked about at the conference, we see such enormous opportunities around our supply chain. Mark is actually here in the room and he\u2019s -- we\u2019re starting to -- we\u2019re very, very early in that process but that was really the bulk of where we saw the potential for operational efficiency and improvement and we remain very optimistic about that. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: As part of that, how dependent is the supply chain on getting the SAP system working effectively? \nFrank Blake: That\u2019s highly dependent on that. Mark, you might want to comment on it. \nMark Holifield: Yes, as you know, we have the core retail SAP implementation going forward in Canada and we are just at the early stages of beginning the plans to get that going in the U.S., but we are on track pretty much with our plans in Canada and expect a pilot with our first stores later this year. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: And then the second question is appliances obviously has a lower gross margin. That\u2019s been an area you\u2019ve been focusing on. Could you walk us through the operating margin difference between selling products such as appliances versus your core products? \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: From an operating margin perspective? \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Is there a dedicated labor force -- do you make it back, in other words, on the operating margin line or is this just something that is going to drive down margins as you grow in those businesses? \nCraig Menear: We do have a dedicated team that from a labor standpoint that is involved with our appliance business but in total, we look at our sales in the appliance category and the growth in that business as part of driving overall top line sales productivity. We are looking for a margin mix in total that would bring the bottom line in conjunction with where our plans would project them to be. So we are not necessarily looking for an individual category look. We are looking at a total mix look. \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: But it\u2019s fair to say we make money on appliances. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go now to Colin McGranahan with Bernstein. \nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: Good morning. I wanted to focus a little bit on the gross margin line, and understanding obviously the first quarter was a difficult quarter from a clearance event and a seasonal event, but I just want to try to understand the tradeoff that you are looking at between comp growth and driving traffic, driving the excitement, which I know is one of the five major initiatives. I just want to try to get a little bit more understanding of how you are thinking about promotional events and whether given the clearance activity in the first quarter you still would expect gross margins in the retail business to be up for the year. \nFrank Blake: First, I\u2019ll make a comment on that and then turn it to Craig. As he commented, we did some promotional events in the first quarter frankly, I take this on myself, in response to the sales environment that didn\u2019t pay out, that weren\u2019t the smartest thing to do. I think as we go forward, the way we are thinking of our promotional events is to make sure they are more impactful and make more sense in terms of driving transactions in our store and yielding gross margin dollars. \nCraig Menear: In terms of when you look at the margin impacts, we made a conscious decision to accelerate clearance in the first quarter, really looking to take advantage of some of the peak traffic time that we have in our store. Obviously didn\u2019t anticipate the weather impact of the first couple of weeks of April, which also put a little bit more of a negative spin on our clearance plan in the quarter.  We will be less promotional, as Frank said, moving forward. I think that it is fair to say mix is difficult for us to predict as we move forward. \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: If I could just jump in from a guidance perspective, based on the drivers of the first quarter performance, we are comfortable with the guidance that we gave on sales for the year, which was mid-single digit negative comp. We did have gross margin guidance as well. We are comfortable with the low-end of that gross margin guidance, which is the 20 basis point range. \nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: Okay, and then Carol while I\u2019ve got you, just a quick follow-up, CapEx in the first quarter seemed a little bit light versus our expectations. Is that still on track for the year? \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: The thing about our capital spending program, as you can appreciate, this is the busiest time of the year for us and so we don\u2019t want to put a lot of activity inside the stores when our customers are there. So you will see the capital start to really take off in the second, third and fourth quarters. \nColin McGranahan - Bernstein: Great, thanks. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go now to Budd Bugatch with Raymond James & Associates. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Thank you and good morning. Payroll to sales you said went up 70 basis points in Q1. Could you reflect that versus what the plan might have been, and maybe tell us how we should think about payroll to sales for the rest of the year? \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: I\u2019ll start and Paul, you might want to jump in, but we were actually over hours in the first quarter, so relative to our plan, the expense deleverage was a little bit more than we anticipated but we\u2019re okay with that. We want to keep people on the floor of the store and we are not coming off the guidance that we gave, that we\u2019ll keep the associates on the floor of the store. \nPaul Raines: As you know, we\u2019ve made a significant commitment beginning the back-half of last year to our voice of the customer projects and service, and we remain committed to that and we continue to see it through the rest of this year. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: I understand and appreciate that, I just wonder whether 76 basis points is a proper run-rate to expect for the rest of the year, or maybe just two-thirds of that, or somehow you can give us a feel for that. \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Sure, Budd. I think that\u2019s a very fair question. The sales were soft, I mean, clearly down almost 8% on a comp store basis, so that deleverage that we experienced in the first quarter is not what we expect to have going forward because we are not expecting a negative 8 comp for the balance of the year. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay, two other areas just quickly; soft flooring has been very weak for a long time and I think the comp performance in the first quarter was maybe amongst the poorest in the stores, if our suppliers are telling us right. What are you doing to fix that? And did I hear you right that you closed both floor stores in the quarter? \nFrank Blake: We did, Budd. We did not think that that pilot was particularly a good idea, or yielded the results that we expected. We are doing a number of things across soft flooring in the stores, and as you can appreciate -- and again, I\u2019ll let Craig comment to some of the specifics -- but as you can appreciate, this is one of those items that goes from what the appearance of the store because it\u2019s a d\u00e9cor kind of sale, the product that we carry in the store, and then the connection to our installers because such a large percentage of that product we install. So getting the right coordination from sale through to installation is a key part of getting that business right.  Craig, do you want to make a couple of additional -- \nCraig Menear: Budd, I think if you look at our key actions that are taking place in the soft flooring market, we are focused on assortment. There are several assortment changes that are coming forward and are being implemented in the store really as we speak. As Frank mentioned, presentation, so we will begin to have some showroom upgrades in this category as well, and then of course we are focused on trying to simplify the offering for our customer from an installation standpoint.  So all three of those are key action areas that we are focused on right now. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: When do you expect some positive comps in that particular area? \nCraig Menear: We are seeing improvement begin in the category. We are a long ways from the category being where we want it to be. \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: I think we should just go ahead and tell you what flooring was, because it wasn\u2019t one of the worst comp departments in the store. Flooring for the quarter was down 8.7%. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: I understand that, Carol, but that included the hard as well. I was just thinking about soft being that area. \nFrank Blake: The other think I would add, Budd, in terms of your question of when this turns around, one of the areas where we have achieved the most success is frankly having more intensive training for our associates on the floor, so if you looked across the whole range of things that we\u2019ve done, and we\u2019ve been working on this -- this isn\u2019t a first quarter issue, this has been a multi-year issue. That\u2019s been one of the ones that\u2019s had the most encouraging performance in terms of turning it around to positive comps, so we are now looking at okay, how do we take those pilots and extend them more broadly? \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: That is exciting, Frank. My last question, Carol, for you is did I understand you have a -- the quality of the inventory is in good shape, that you\u2019ve now with the better weather, the quality is okay and the amount of clearance should be therefore reduced in upcoming quarters? \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: The inventory lumps are in the seasonal categories. It\u2019s patio, grill, tractors -- just good stuff and we are starting to see the inventory come down as the sales improve. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Thank you very much. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go now to Steve Chick with J.P. Morgan. \nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. Paul, you had outlined a projection of $200 million of payroll deleverage I think for 2007 back at the analyst presentation. I was wondering if you could speak to the payroll deleverage in terms of that target for the year.  Secondly to that, with that and the $100 million investment that you made at the end of the second half, are you seeing improved customer service levels and sales related to the dollars that you are allocating to that investment? \nPaul Raines: Maybe I\u2019ll start with talking about the second piece of that and I\u2019ll let Carol answer the first piece. I think we are seeing improved results. If you see our BOC metrics, we are clearly ahead on year over year on all of those metrics. We are seeing a significant improvement in the customer experience on all of those metrics. We also have a significant morale improvement in our stores, which as you know our associates, the ability to take care of customers is a big driver of their own morale, so we are pleased with that and we think that\u2019s part of it.  In terms of the deleverage, I think the main issue for us is we are going to continue to fund the activities in the store based on what our service model is and we don\u2019t expect to see the kind of impact top line that we saw in the first quarter.  Carol, I don\u2019t know what you want to say about the deleverage. \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: That\u2019s right. We\u2019re on track. \nPaul Raines: We\u2019re on track. \nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: But I guess -- for the $200 million, if I just simplistically take 76 basis points of deleverage this quarter and look at it relative to retail sales, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too simplistic to look at it that way but that\u2019s about $140 million of deleverage. Is it too simplistic to look at it that way? \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: The payroll number I shared was total payroll inside the store. What Paul is referring to is hourly payroll, so I think we need to back that out. Hourly payroll we deleveraged by about 36 basis points in the first quarter, so maybe that\u2019s helpful. \nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Okay, so the target that you\u2019ve set out, you think that\u2019s the right type of investment you need to make with hours in the stores? \nFrank Blake: I would also say, Steve, it\u2019s not as though we started this and said it\u2019s a $200 million bucket and where are we on the $200 million bucket. It\u2019s much more, as Paul said, what do we need on the floor of our store to adequately serve our customers? Look what happened to us on the first quarter was we kept to that despite some pressure on the sales. So if the bucket is slightly more or slightly less than the $200 million, that\u2019s going to float a bit with what the sales are. \nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Second question, if I could, Frank, just in terms of the process with Home Depot Supply. I understand the sensitivities around speaking to it, but it was February 12th I think that you mentioned you were evaluating the review. I guess we are all anxious to hear the end of that evaluation but it is a little surprising that you haven\u2019t decided yet. Can you speak to what the delay is, so to speak and how things are going with the process? \nFrank Blake: Sure, I\u2019d be happy to. I guess just so you know my mindset, I have to say I don\u2019t see this at all as a delay. We are 90 days, give or take, 90 days into the process and truly, as you can well imagine, this wasn\u2019t something that we had been thinking about 90 days before or 120 days before, so we are 90 days into the process and I think if you ask most folks what this kind of process takes, something between 90 and 180 -- I mean, 90 days would almost be unheard of. 180 days is probably more the norm. We are I think going to be a lot more expeditious in this but I don\u2019t see this as a delay at all. \nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Okay, but are you pretty encouraged by the process in terms of feedback and interest level and things like that, in the event you go that route? \nFrank Blake: I think -- look, there\u2019s a lot of things we think about on a strategic evaluation process. One is the interest from other people in the assets and I think we\u2019ve got some strong interest in the assets and then the other part is our own internal evaluation of what is the best thing for our shareholders with these assets. \nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Will we hear a conclusion by the end of next quarter, do you think? \nFrank Blake: This is what I wouldn\u2019t comment on. \nSteve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thanks. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go now to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about how you are going to get customers back into the store? It seemed like Craig commented that from a promotional spend, that you would be less promotional in 2Q. I\u2019m just curious how you are going to get, how you expect to get customers back into the store to see the improved morale, improved energy in the store, improved execution. \nFrank Blake: First, I\u2019ll give a general comment on that, but offering -- to my mind, there\u2019s a difference between promotional activity and offering compelling values. The compelling values will drive footsteps into our stores and that\u2019s what we have to be focused and never lose that proposition to our customers.  Then, I would also say if you look at where we are in the market, probably one of our biggest opportunities is conversion -- converting the customers who come into our stores as it is now. We are the top-of-mind home improvement retailer, so fortunately we are not faced with just an issue of gee, do I want to go into Home Depot? but when I\u2019m in Home Depot looking at this category, do I see the compelling value? Do they have the product that I want?  Craig, I don\u2019t know if you want to add to that. \nCraig Menear: Eric, it\u2019s really continuing to work the merchandising strategy that I laid out at the conference. We have to continue to focus on improving our offering, as Frank has mentioned, as it relates to not only the value proposition but the line structure, and then really making sure that we communicate those values to our customers properly through our marketing efforts. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: And then just a follow-up for Carol, if I could. In terms of the guidance, Carol, you said that you are now at the low-end of the earnings guidance but maintaining what sounds like the same comp guidance. Is the deviation for the year just reflective of what happened in 1Q, or do you have a different perspective of how the rest of the year will lay out versus what your prior expectations were? \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, clearly there\u2019s the impact of the first quarter because we were below our earnings plan for the first quarter. As we look out for the remaining quarters, the change in our guidance really is on the gross margin line, where we believe we will have margin expansion but it won\u2019t be on the high-end of the margin expansion that we had guided to earlier in the year. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Thank you. \nDiane Dayhoff: We have time for one more question. \nOperator: We will take our final question from Chris Horvers with Bear Stearns. \nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Thank you. Good morning. Can you talk about the bay reset program for the year and how deep you are into that and how we should think about clearance activities looking forward? \nCraig Menear: In terms of our merchandising resets, we are on track to continue driving change within our stores through multiple categories. You will see that begin to ramp up a little bit more heavily as we move towards the back-half of the second quarter. As Carol mentioned earlier, we do try to purposefully keep some of the activity out of this high-traffic timeframe so that we don\u2019t disrupt the stores. \nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: So should we expect clearance activity to also pick up in line with that? \nCraig Menear: We accelerated clearance in the first quarter and we\u2019ll see a more normalized clearance approach going through the balance of the year. \nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Okay, and on a related question as we think about the payroll and the maintenance spend on the stores, the cadence of that spending as we look throughout the year, how do you look at that and does the fact that you really started some of these programs in the back-half of last year make it less of a drag in the back-half? \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: As we mentioned at our investor conference, in support of our five key priorities, we are spending about $1.6 billion in capital, about $600 million in expense, so you are going to see that drag, if you will, in every quarter.  We are investing for the long-term. \nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: But the fact that you spent $500 million or so in the back-half of last year, you are going to spend the incremental on top of that? \nFrank Blake: Again, it\u2019s important that while we spend, we also -- in the back-half of \u201906 we also know that just programmatically, there are improvements we have to be making in our stores. \nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Finally, as you think about the big ticket categories like kitchen and bath, clearly I expected that to be a drag on the comp perspective. How is that versus your expectations? Was it worse and did April have an impact and maybe saw some marginal or sequential improvement in May? \nCraig Menear: I would say that it is fair to say in some of the big ticket category spending it was a little bit more difficult than what we had anticipated. \nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Any improvement in the back-half of the quarter or May? \nFrank Blake: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still a little early. \nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: We\u2019re two weeks into May. \nChris Horvers - Bear Stearns: Okay. Thank you. \nFrank Blake: Thank you all very much. \nDiane Dayhoff: Thanks for joining us. \nOperator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for your participation and have a great day.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $14.6 billion. Comp sales were negative 13%. When adjusted for the seasonal shift caused by having 53 weeks in our fiscal 2007, our comp sales were negative 11.5%.  At the end of January, we announced several actions that we are taking in light of current market conditions. These included shutting down our expo businesses, restructuring support positions, and writing down our equity interest in HD Supply. Those actions resulted in $550 million of charges in the fourth quarter. Excluding those charges, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.19.  Carol will give you more detail in a few minutes on both our fourth quarter and fiscal year numbers. As a general comment, we anticipated a difficult quarter and year and they were all that and more. The issues impacting us are familiar to you all -- the housing market is still depressed, the percent of GDP now spent on housing related construction is at 3.1%. This is the lowest that it has ever been in 60 years of recorded data and we anticipate further deterioration. The credit markets are still stressed for consumers and businesses alike and unemployment continues to increase.  We have seen some improvement in our California and Florida markets in the sense that the rate of decline has slowed but these relative improvements are more than offset by declines elsewhere in the country.  Our Canadian business started the year strong but deteriorated in the second half as the global economy began to weaken. Also, the implementation of the bulk of our core retail pilot occurred in the second half in Canada and that caused some additional distraction in a difficult time. For the year, Canada posted mid-single-digit negative comps. China, while small, had positive comps, and our business in Mexico had another great year, with double-digit positive comps.  There were some very positive signs of improved business performance during 2008. We said at the start of the year that we would maintain a flat to slightly positive gross margin rate for the year. We did that and we did it at the same time we launched a new lower price campaign. This is indicative of better control and coordination within our merchandising organization and our effective focus on everyday pricing. We also reduced our inventory by over $1 billion while at the same time maintaining the best in-stock rate we\u2019ve had in several years.  Again, this reflects planning, focus, and execution across the business from merchandising to store operations to supply chain to finance, and we continue to see improvement in customer satisfaction as measured by our voice-of-the-customer surveys and by independent third parties. We also gained market share in key categories, as Craig will describe.  For 2009, we anticipate another difficult year. We are expecting sales to decline approximately 9% and earnings per share to decline by about 7%. Excluding the impacts of our strategic actions from this January and the store rationalization charges of earlier in 2008, we expect earnings per share to decline approximately 26%.  Let me add a note of caution here -- last year at this time, we provided guidance in terms of a range of performance for 2008. This year, we are not providing a range. That doesn\u2019t mean that we are more certain about 2009 than we were about 2008 -- in fact, 2009 is an even more uncertain planning horizon. Housing inventory remains high; consumer demand remains soft, and the impact of government stimulus is uncertain. But rather than giving a very broad range, which would not provide you much of an understanding of how we think about the business, we thought it better to provide our working estimate. Carol will outline for you the key assumptions underlying this estimate. Our intent is to provide a reasonably transparent framework for thinking about our business without implying a certainty that would be misplaced in the current environment. And while we are anticipating a tough year in 2009, we will continue to make progress in improving our business. Over the last two years, we have become a simpler company, which is a good thing. We have exited non-core businesses; we have restructured support staff; we have stopped applying significant capital to building new square footage; and we have renegotiated our private label credit agreement. These actions will make us a better business. They also allow us to focus in 2009 on the steps we know we have to take for long-term success.  We have to improve our supply chain. With the opening of our fifth RDC in January, RDCs now serve approximately 500 of our stores. By the end of 2009, we expect that they will serve over 1,000 stores. We are pleased with the results we have seen to date with RDCs and we anticipate additional improvement as we get closer to critical mass on the number of stores served, vendors [on board], and percent of cost of goods flowing through the facilities.  We have to improve our merchandising tools. We have made progress over the last two years on this and 2008\u2019s performance on margin rate and inventory would not have been possible without the improved tools and disciplines we have already put in place. Matt Carey and our IT team, along with Craig and the merchandising team, have additional improvements in process for 2009. We are not contemplating any significant spend on a U.S. based enterprise wide system in 2009. We have the advantage of being able to assess the benefits of putting such a program in place in Canada in 2008 and we\u2019ll be in a good position at the end of 2009 to assess whether such an investment for the U.S. would make sense.  And we have to continue to improve our customer service. Marvin and the store operations team have applied the same concept of simplification to our stores. Last year, we re-invested over $250 million annualized in hours to the floor of the store, our Aprons-on-the-Floor initiative. This year, Marvin and Tim [Pro], our Head of HR, and their teams will focus on improving our training so that we enhance our associates\u2019 effectiveness.  We are going into 2009 conscious that we have to preserve the momentum in improving our business and also conscious that we have to be more disciplined than ever in our use of cash. Our capital spending is back-end weighted and we\u2019ll be prepared to adjust if circumstances require, and we\u2019ll continue to carefully control our discretionary spending.  I want to thank our associates for all their hard work and dedication during a very tough year and their commitment for the year ahead. Our associates carry the culture of our company to our customers every day and I am very proud that even in these difficult times, we had a record number of stores participate in our success sharing program for hourly associates.  Now let me turn the call over to Craig. \nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank and good morning, everyone. Our sales reflect the ongoing softness in the home improvement market. For the quarter and full year, our remerchandising department experienced negative comp sales growth compared to 2007. In the fourth quarter, the departments that outperformed the company\u2019s average comp were building materials, plumbing, seasonal, paint, and hardware. Flooring performed at the company\u2019s average comp.  From a regional perspective, sales trends were mixed. In the areas that first experienced the housing downturn, there are some signs of stabilization. For example, markets such as Miami, San Francisco, and San Diego are still posting negative comps but have shown a significant improvement in comps in the fourth quarter versus last year. However, in areas that previously showed some resilience, like Cleveland, Seattle, and Pittsburgh, we are seeing greater softness.  We also saw strong comps for regions that had been affected by severe weather. The Gulf Region posted positive comps in the fourth quarter as communities continued to rebuild following last summer\u2019s hurricanes. Additionally, we saw increased sales in chemicals, flashlights, chainsaws, portable generators, shovels, and snow blowers as a result of ice storms that spread across the Midwest and Kentucky.  I want to take a moment to thank our store associates, merchants, and logistics teams for coordinating the efforts during those ice storms to ensure that we had the right products in the stores to take care of our customers. It was a tremendous collaboration and they executed very well.  During the quarter, we continued to experience softness in big ticket projects. We define these projects as those transactions over $500. In this average ticket tier, we saw double-digit declines during the quarter. Contrast this with transactions with tickets under $20 where the decline was just 2.7%. In total, average ticket for the fourth quarter on a comparable 13-week basis was down 7.5% to $50.87. We continued to see relative strength in basic repair and remodel as evidence of our plumbing, hardware, and paint department results.  We also were pleased with our better execution and performance in our holiday and seasonal gift merchandise. While there are several economic factors affecting our results that we cannot control, we continue to focus on those areas we can control. We are executing on our merchandising transformation to provide a great, everyday value to our customers and will continue to do so in 2009. At the heart of our merchandising transformation is our portfolio strategy. This defines the role and intent of our merchandise categories to capture the full basket on project sales, driving sales and gross margin productivity.  Our new lower price campaign is a major component of our portfolio strategy, where we shout out value on key products and project starters across the store. An example of this is in interior paint, where we have lowered prices on items such as Behr\u2019s Flat Premium Plus. Unit sales are increasing and at the same time, our attachment sales of related items are going up. Overall, we are pleased with the results of this campaign and can already see that our customers are responding to this program.  Despite the deterioration we saw in the fourth quarter sales as a result of the worsening economy, we were very pleased that our comp transactions did not decline sharply in the fourth quarter. Comp transactions were a negative 5.8% compared to the full year at negative 5.5%. Our enhanced assortment planning and forecasting tools allowed our merchants to make faster decisions in this business environment. Enhanced forecasting is particularly important in our seasonal businesses. We knew it was going to be a difficult holiday season, so in the U.S., we assorted accordingly and planned for less inventory in these categories. This result in better sell-through and fewer markdowns. To put this in perspective, our special buy, seasonal merchandise, we purchased fewer goods, had better than 90% sell-through while reducing markdowns nearly 10%.  This was also a quarter of unprecedented swings in commodities like I\u2019ve never seen. Framing lumber reached its lowest level since 1990 and copper and oil prices fell over 50% from the beginning of the quarter. Despite this and the softer sales, our new processes and tools allowed us to better manage the business, deliver a solid gross margin and inventory performance in the U.S.  We are confident that our merchandising strategy is working, as evidenced by our unit share gains in nine out of our 13 departments during the quarter. Based on independent third-party tracking of our consumer activity, we saw strong unit share gains in several key merchandising classes -- carpet, hand tools, power tools, blinds, windows and doors, to name a few.  We feel good as we head into the spring in this challenging environment. We utilized our assortment of management tools to refine our seasonal assortments and to strengthen our value segments at the opening and middle price points. In the fourth quarter, we saw some customers purchase top-of-the-line snow removal product as they traded in their third-party service contracts and opted to do it themselves. We are prepared to provide customers with the necessary products in lawn equipment, chemicals, and fertilizer categories should this trend continue into the spring businesses.  2009 is going to be another tough year, but we are focused on merchandising fundamentals and we are well-positioned to execute. And now I would like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol B. Tome: Thank you, Craig and hello, everyone. Our financial results for the quarter and year are distorted by a few factors that I would like to discuss and get out of the way before I cover our results.  For the fourth quarter and the year, we will be comparing our results against an extra week, as fiscal 2007 was a 53-week year. The extra week in 2007 added approximately $1.1 billion to sales and approximately $0.04 to earnings per share. We had several strategic charges in fiscal 2008, which we have highlighted on an exhibit to our press release.  For the year, the charges totaled $951 million, representing a $564 million store rationalization charge related to the closing of 15 under-performing stores and the removal of 50 stores from our new store opening pipeline, and a $387 million charge taken in the fourth quarter in connection with the closing of our expo businesses and support staff reductions. For the purpose of this call, we will refer to these charges as the business rationalization charge.  Finally, earnings from continuing operations were impacted by a $163 million write-down of our investment in HD Supply, which is reflected in other expense, and we reported a $52 million loss net of taxes from discontinued operations related to the settlement of an HD Supply working capital matter.  So with that, in the fourth quarter, sales were $14.6 billion, a 17.3% decrease from last year. For the year, our sales declined by 7.8% to $71.3 billion. Excluding last year\u2019s extra week, sales were down 12% for the quarter and 6.5% for the year.  Comp or same-store sales were negative 13% for the quarter, with negative comps up 12.6% in November, negative 17.4% in December, and negative 9.2% in January. The monthly comps are distorted because last year\u2019s extra week shifted our fiscal calendar. On a like-for-like basis, for the fourth quarter comps were negative 11.5%. Now like-for-like comps for our U.S. stores were a negative 9.2%.  Roughly 10% of our sales are from outside of the U.S. In the fourth quarter, we saw significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all currencies. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted total company comps by 190 basis points in the quarter.  For the year, comp sales were negative 8.7%. Neither the calendar shift or foreign exchange had a meaningful impact to comps for the year.  Excluding the fourth quarter business rationalization charge and the HD Supply write-downs, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.19 for the fourth quarter. For the year, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.37.  On an adjusted basis, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.78, down 21.6%, slightly better than our most recent guidance.  In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 34%, a decrease of 32 basis points from last year, reflecting the following factors. First, our U.S. retail business reported five basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, due primarily to better shrink results than last year. Through our focused [inaudible] portfolio approach, our merchants are driving new lower prices while maintaining overall gross margin. This gross margin expansion was offset by 14 basis points, or $20 million, related to markdowns taken in connection with the closing of the expo businesses.  Second, we realized 23 basis points of margin contraction, primarily related to our Canadian business, reflecting the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, a promotional December, and inventory adjustments related to our score or SAP conversion.  For the year, our gross margin was 33.7%, up four basis points from last year. Excluding the markdowns associated with the business rationalization charge, our gross margin increased by eight basis points from last year.  In the fourth quarter, operating expenses increased by 493 basis points to 32.1% of sales. Excluding the business rationalization charge, operating expense increased by 241 basis points to 29.6%. Our expense deleverage reflects the impact of negative sales, where we expect to deleverage expenses for every point of negative comp by about 20 basis points.  In the fourth quarter, our expense deleverage per point of negative comp was about 18 basis points, including the cost of private label credit. Throughout the year, we had been experiencing additional expense deleverage due to rising costs associated with our private label credit program. In the fourth quarter, and as expected, the expense pressure from our private label credit card moderated.  For the year, operating expenses increased by 329 basis points to 27.5% of sales. Excluding the business rationalization charge, operating expenses increased by 200 basis points to 26.2% of sales.  Net interest and other expense was $297 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $105 million. For the year, net interest and other expense was $769 million, an increase of $147 million from last year. Both the quarter and year reflect a $163 million charge due to a 50% write-down of our investment in HD Supply.  Now moving to our operational metrics, during the fourth quarter we opened six net new stores, including one relocation, for an ending store count of 2,274. At the end of the fourth quarter, selling square footage was $238 million, a 1.3% increase from last year. Reflecting the sales environment and excluding last year\u2019s extra week, total sales per square foot for fiscal 2008 were $298, down roughly 9%.  Now turning to the balance sheet, our team has done an excellent job of controlling inventory in this sales environment and the quality of our inventory has never been better. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $10.7 billion, down 9% from last year. On a per-store basis, inventory was down 10.6% to last year. Inventory turns were four times, compared to 4.2 times last year.  We ended the quarter with $41 billion in assets, including $525 million in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $68 million in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2007, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $5.3 billion, offset by $1.8 billion of capital expenditures, $2 billion used to repay outstanding commercial paper and other debt obligations, and $1.5 billion of dividends.  As a reminder, we have a $3.25 billion A2P2 commercial paper program that is 100% back-stopped by a committed long-term bank line of credit. As of the end of the year, we had no outstanding commercial paper.  Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, and excluding the business rationalization charge, return on invested capital was approximately 11.4%. As Frank mentioned, we expect 2009 to be challenging. Our guidance reflects our best thinking at this point. We have detailed our guidance in our press release, so let me just hit the high points.  First, let me remind you that we guide off of GAAP. We have based our working estimate on a number of external factors, including GDP, where our view is that nominal GDP will fall by 2.5% in the first half, and fall by 1.1% in the second half. Now our view on GDP does not include any potential lift from the economic stimulus package, which could be positive, or any impact if there were to be a significant increase in the personal savings rate, which could be negative.  As of today, we expect fiscal 2009 sales to decline by 9%, with negative comps in the high-single-digit area. We expect the first half to be softer than the back half of the year.  For fiscal 2009, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations to decline by 7%. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share to decline approximately 26%. Included in our earnings per share guidance is our view that gross margin expansion will be flat to slightly positive for the year, and expenses as a percent of sales should be flat year over year, but clearly this is distorted by the business rationalization charge. On an adjusted basis, we expect to deleverage expenses by about 13 basis points per point of negative comp, and this reflects the benefit of our support staff reductions, a lower cost of private label credit, and the exit of the expo businesses.  Now moving to capital allocations, our capital spending plan for 2009 is $1 billion, reflecting $175 million for new stores, $577 million for our existing U.S. stores and supply chain, $200 million for core IT and other corporate initiatives, and $72 million for our non-U.S. businesses.  We expect to open 12 stores this year, with about half of those openings in Canada and Mexico.  We have approximately $11.4 million of long-term debt, of which $1.8 billion comes due in the latter part of 2009. At this point, it is our intent to repay the debt maturities as they come due using cash generated by the business.  Finally, I want to give you our latest thinking on our recapitalization plan. In 2007, we completed almost 50% of our $22.5 billion recapitalization plan. Shortly after, we put the recap on pause given market conditions and it will stay on pause until we see stabilization in our business and the credit markets.  So thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call and August, we\u2019re now ready for questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Good morning. Throughout the call today we heard about the newly improved assortment management tools. How much more opportunity is there to improve the processes?\nFrank Blake: Deborah, I would say we\u2019re really in the early innings of that, so just starting but Craig, why don\u2019t you address that?\nCraig Menear: Yeah, Deborah, I think it would be fair to say that we are probably at this stage maybe a quarter of the way through the process, or even maybe slightly just a little less than that. So we have a lot of work to still do. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Okay, and then we\u2019ll sneak one more question in -- on the RDCs, I think it was said on the call it was the best [in-stock] rate that you had experienced in five years. Can you compare your RDC [serve stores] and non-RDC [serve stores]?\nFrank Blake: So at this point, Deborah, they are roughly the same. We have seen a little bit better performance from our RDC supported stores but to tell you the truth, the supply chain as a whole, along with our store operations team and our merchandise team, have just done an excellent job on the in-stock rate, so that improvement reflects improvement across the company, not just in the RDC supported stores. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Great. Thanks so much. Keep up the great work and best of luck. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Good morning. Focusing back on the RDCs for a second here, it sounds like that by the end of next year, or nearly half of the store base will be served by an RDC. I know Mark had talked about initially some obviously inventory benefits, some supply chain cost benefits, operating margin benefits. I think it was 30 or 40 basis points. How are you thinking about those benefits now that you have five of these open, and how is that impacting your outlook for inventory at the end of next year, inventory turnover and the potential margin benefits that could accrue in \u201909 from the supply chain improvements?\nFrank Blake: I would say first, and then Mark is here and he\u2019ll address your question in more detail, Colin, but I would say we are still very pleased with the results and counting on those results as we go forward. In 2009, it\u2019s not yet at critical mass in terms of whether we see the benefit on inventory turnover. We are immediately seeing the benefit on transportation on the freight cost but less so on the in-stock and inventory turn. Mark, do you want to -- \nMark Holifield: Sure, just a bit more detail on RDC -- as Frank said, we opened our fifth this quarter. That opened in Allentown, Pennsylvania. We had about five weeks of operation there and all of our KPIs -- key performance indicators -- are looking good there and meeting our expectations. The four other RDCs are progressing well against their KPIs as well, and we are on track to achieve the original business case for the RDCs. We expect to be serving about half of our stores by the end of 2009, and by the end of 2010 serving all of them. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, and then just a quick follow-up for Carol -- you know, it looks like the free cash flow should be up nicely in 2009. I understand you have $1.8 billion in maturities but are you -- do you plan maybe to just keep excess cash on the balance sheet at this point? And do you have a specific outlook for what you expect on free cash flow?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, we expect it will generate more than enough cash to meet all of our obligations, including our dividend, which is $1.5 billion; our CapEx, which is $1 billion, to repay our debt maturities, which is $1.8 billion, and the additional cash that is generated will be held in the bank. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot. If we could get a little more color on the progression of your business through the quarter -- you had that dip in December and I\u2019m not sure if there was calendar distortion behind that but I would like to get just kind of quantitative color there and also how you experienced holiday this year, given the promotional environment and any particular merchandising efforts you brought to bear. \nFrank Blake: Matt, why don\u2019t -- I think probably it would help if Carol gave you the adjusted comps through those months and then both she and Craig can comment on the holiday season. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: That would be great. \nCarol B. Tome: Hey, Matt. We saw some real distortion because of the calendar shift, so first let me give you the adjusted comps for total company and then I\u2019ll give you the adjusted comps for U.S. store.  So the adjusted comps for total company in the month of November were at negative 11.7%; in the month of December, negative 10.8%; and in the month of January, negative 11.9%. For the U.S. stores, the adjusted comp was negative 9.5% in November, negative 8.6% in December, and negative 9.4% in January. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: And when you give us total company, that is not local currency but U.S. dollar comps for -- as they\u2019re impacted by Canada?\nCarol B. Tome:  That is the total company comps in U.S. dollars reflecting exchange rate impacts, yes. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Okay, good. \nFrank Blake: And Craig, do you want to comment on the holiday season?\nCraig Menear: Yes, overall on the holiday season, we were pretty pleased, Matt, with the overall performance when we looked at where we gained share, hand tools, power tools, holiday, decorating. You know, we felt pretty good about the end result. It was a tough environment, obviously, in the market but at the same time, we gained share and we came out as clean as we have ever come out, so we feel pretty positive about it. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Gotcha, and then one quick follow-up -- you talked about Florida and California showing smaller declines. We\u2019ve heard that from different companies at different times over the past two years, so I guess how consistently have you seen the comp decline moderation in those markets?\nFrank Blake: So it\u2019s been pretty consistent for the last few quarters, Matt, that California and Florida are -- the rate of comp decline is improving. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: How do they compare with the total company level?\nCarol B. Tome: Just a data point -- if you look at -- and this is what we reported, you know, we reported negative comp of 13%. If you back out California and Florida, the comp would have been negative 13.5%. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Gotcha -- okay, thank you so much. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Lasser with Barclays Capital.\nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: Good morning, thanks. If you start to see competitors become more aggressive from a promotional perspective in the upcoming year, what\u2019s your sense for how you are going to respond, particularly because you will have some gross margin cushion from your enhanced inventory assortment efforts?\nFrank Blake: So Michael, I mean, the -- one of the things that really lies behind the portfolio approach is that we try to articulate pretty clearly for ourselves what the role is of each category and where it\u2019s critical to set the right price impression, where it may not be, where we have some opportunities. And so we\u2019re trying to set the path to provide the most value for the customer and then the response is really going to be dictated by what\u2019s our overall portfolio strategy.  Craig, do you want to elaborate on that?\nCraig Menear: For about the last year-and-a-half, we\u2019ve been really focused on trying to work hard to eliminate promotional activity in our business. You know, we\u2019re not 100% there, obviously but that is the strategy to get back to providing great value for our customers every single day. And I think we\u2019ve shared with you on past calls that promotional activity that we had out there in the past wasn\u2019t really nutritive to the business and we are simply converting that type of spend into driving our portfolio strategy and really focusing on the project business. And so we\u2019re conscious, obviously, of the market that we compete in. We have to be because that\u2019s at the heart of driving value to our customers. But we\u2019re going to really react based on our portfolio strategy approach. \nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: Maybe I\u2019ll ask it a little bit differently then -- how much of the flat to slightly up gross margin guidance for the year is a result of the focus bay approach, and how much is inherent, you know, are you assuming that the promotional environment in the upcoming year is going to become more [intense]? And then what is the risk that there\u2019s a structural change in the home improvement sub-sector that gross margins are structurally lower because everyone else is just chasing traffic? Thanks. \nFrank Blake: Well, again, Michael, the way we look at it is our job is to provide the compelling value to our customers and that\u2019s what sets the strategy, so I -- it\u2019s -- we don\u2019t start with an assumption of hey, here\u2019s how we see all the different potentials on the competitive environment. We start from the -- where do we know we have to go to provide great value to our customer and build from there? \nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: Okay. Thank you for your comments. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Gregory Melich with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. I have two questions -- one on credit and then on CapEx. On credit, we know how much it helps the SG&A, Carol -- have you guys thought about how much it could impact the top line in terms of the percentage of your sales that would be on credit, or reduced credit lines for some of your private label card customers?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, today we are approving 76% of all new applications and in 2008, we opened up $3.2 million accounts. Now, the approval line, if you will, is dropped by about 6% so the average line that\u2019s been approved is $6,850. The through-the-door FICO scores are 705, so we still think that credit is going to be an important value proposition going forward. As a penetration of total sales, it was down slightly from last year at about 28%.  We\u2019re really focused on just asking our customers every time they shop with us if they would like to use their private label credit card. We\u2019re not going to push credit at them but we certainly encourage them to use it and we have factored in our best thinking as it relates to credit in the guidance that we\u2019ve given. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great, so you expect to see that could drop a little bit in terms of percentage, like it did last year?\nCarol B. Tome: I think that\u2019s actually very reasonable, yeah. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And then on CapEx, for anyone there, if you think about it longer term, the billing that you are doing this year, which makes I guess a lot of sense given where we are in, on a five-year view, what do you think that needs to be or should be, if we were thinking out longer term?\nFrank Blake: Well, I think we\u2019ve said in the past in terms of applying CapEx to new stores that we see a constrained opportunity but there\u2019s still some opportunity, so I think we\u2019ve talked about average -- over time, a little over 1% growth in new square footage, around 1.5%, 1.4% growth in new square footage. So as you go forward, as communities shift, as you have to follow different geographies, they will -- we\u2019ll continue to put in some new square footage but it is going to be significantly less, obviously, than it has been in the past.  And there are other things that we obviously are looking at closely. We\u2019ll continue to spend CapEx on our building out our new supply chain on the IT side, as I said in my comments, we\u2019re going to be spending this year, observing how, what the results are in Canada with the new enterprise wide system that they have in place, because if we were to decide to do that, that would obviously require some resources as well. \nCarol B. Tome: And as we look out, we can\u2019t imagine a scenario where our capital spending would ever exceed our annual depreciation and amortization expense. And as a reminder, the RDCs are not capital intensive. In 2009, we\u2019ll be spending about $89 million in support of our RDC investment. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: That\u2019s great. Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Thank you for taking my question. Good morning. Can you talk, Carol, the linearity of that basis point of deleverage for every comp point of deleverage? At 13 basis points, how linear is that as that moves up and down? Obviously the comps are a big number now. \nCarol B. Tome: Right -- well, we feel pretty good about that. Budd, you know, this is an art, not a science. Could it move a couple of basis points if the comps were worse than we thought? Sure, but we feel pretty good about that. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: And on the upside?\nCarol B. Tome: We should start to see leverage as soon as we hit a 0% comp. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay. Secondly, the 12 net new stores, off of what base are we looking at? Because we still have yard birds and expo and the store count -- I\u2019m just making sure I understand. \nCarol B. Tome: Yeah, we have -- yeah, expo is still in there, so it\u2019s just add 12 and subtract 34. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay, and the same for yard birds too? I mean, it\u2019s 12 net off of the -- \nCarol B. Tome: Yes, it\u2019s 12 net off -- subtract from the 2,274 that we ended the year, subtract 41 and add 12. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Gotcha. Okay, and finally on the CapEx, it\u2019s about -- what, about $250,000 per store, if my math is right, right now excluding what you are going to spend on the supply chain? Is that number look like a number that will be constant over a couple of years?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, there are a couple of things to remember -- first, we did some catch-up spending that we don\u2019t need to repeat in 2009. We also have a lot of expense dollars that we spend on just maintaining our stores. In fact, over $500 million of expense dollars go into maintaining our stores. So if we look at what we are spending on a per square footage base, just maintaining the stores, it\u2019s a little less than $3 a square foot and we feel pretty good about that. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay. Thanks, Carol. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question will come from John [Zolidis] with Buckingham Research.\nJohn Zolidis - Buckingham Research: Good morning. Just a clean-up question on the foreign currency -- can you tell us what the total impact to sales was in the fourth quarter, and if there was any material impact to the bottom line? And then what is anticipated in the guidance for foreign currency impact in 2009? Thank you. \nCarol B. Tome: The impact to sales is about $320 million in the fourth quarter. There was no material impact to the bottom line and as we look out for 2009, included in our guidance is our view that the currencies will stay where they are, so we\u2019re not assuming further strengthening of the U.S. dollar or any weakening as a point, so there is a year-over-year impact to ourselves because of where the currencies are today and that\u2019s included in the guidance. \nJohn Zolidis - Buckingham Research: Can you give us some help on what that might be and since you report the comps in U.S. dollars, is there maybe a 100 basis points impact from FX in that?\nCarol B. Tome: That\u2019s right -- there\u2019s about 100 basis points. \nJohn Zolidis - Buckingham Research: Okay. Thank you. \nCarol B. Tome: You\u2019re welcome. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Maggie Gilliam with Gilliam & Company.\nMaggie Gilliam - Gilliam & Company: Could you comment on what is the status of the SAP system in Canada and what are your plans for implementing it in the U.S.? I know there has been a little bit of talk about simplifying it or making some modifications going forward. Thank you. \nFrank Blake: Sure. Good morning, Maggie. First, great credit to the Canadian team and our IT team for the implementation of the system. I mean, you look at major efforts like this and a lot of times, you run into some significant unanticipated issues. This was done on time and the Canadian team really did just an excellent job of getting it in place. Now, going forward, we have the opportunity to figure out okay, what are the benefits, who do those benefits compare to our ongoing efforts to improve our infrastructure here in the U.S., and then assess kind of towards the end of 2009, what\u2019s the best path forward for the United States? Matt Carey, our IT leader, is here in the room and so I -- Matt, if you want to add some comments to that. \nMatt Carey: Absolutely. We intend on measuring the impact and the return that we\u2019ve gotten or are going to get in this system and we\u2019ll assess it throughout the year and go through a few seasonal cycles and make sure that it meets our expectations before we make a call. \nFrank Blake: Thanks. \nDiane Dayhoff: Augusta, I think we\u2019re ready for the next question. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Wayne Hood with BMO Capital Markets.\nWayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets: Good morning. I guess on Canada again, Carol specifically to you, I guess as you look at their implementation there, there was some inventory adjustments and as you look at that, what do you see there that might mean or imply inventory adjustments that might be needed in the U.S. if you rolled out SAP and how much is their inventory down up there since that rollout -- about 5% or 10% or can you put some parameters around that?\nCarol B. Tome: Well Wayne, we haven\u2019t done the analysis in the United States to be able to quantify what it could mean but anytime you convert, and I think you know we converted from retail method of inventory to cost and there was an inventory adjustment that took place, so that impacted the gross margin performance in the fourth quarter. We also had some shrinkage and that was really because of the disruption associated with the implementation. So I can tell you what it meant to Canada, which we called out in this overall impact to the company gross margin up in Canada -- it was about 23 basis points. The inventory piece related to the score or SAP implementation was about 12 basis points. So I can\u2019t tell you what it means for the U.S. \nWayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, and then I just had a quick question for Craig; Craig, you indicated some increase in units you are employing in some of these other areas. I am just wondering, when you think about fully allocating expenses back to these labor intensive departments, what level of profitability are you seeing year over year, even though your share may be up?\nCraig Menear: When we look at our flooring business -- for example, soft flooring has been a very strong business for us, where we\u2019ve been gaining share and when we look at the overall profitability of that product category, we\u2019re actually very pleased with our results. \nWayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets: So it\u2019s up year over year, fully allocated?\nCraig Menear: All in, when you look at everything, yeah, we\u2019re very happy with where we are at. \nWayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Nagel with UBS.\nBrian Nagel - UBS: Good morning. I wanted to just follow-up; you commented in your prepared remarks about California and Florida, and seeing some signs of stabilization there and some weakness, some incremental weakness in other markets. I guess as we think about the trend of business throughout the country and how the trend is likely to change potentially as we go through 2009, are there regions of the country that are still uncharacteristically strong, that are helping to support comps? That\u2019s one question.  And then the second, going back to California and Florida, as you\u2019ve seen maybe signs of stabilization there, do you think that reflects, or to what degree does that reflect sales of foreclosed homes?\nFrank Blake: Brian, a couple of comments -- the first would be, just so that everybody is clear, they are still declining, so -- I mean, it\u2019s not stabilization in the sense of oh, okay, well, we\u2019ve actually bottomed. This is just a rate of decline that is slowing.  The second, in terms of areas that are positive, as Craig called out in the weather-impacted areas, we\u2019ve seen positive comps, so we\u2019ve seen positive comps in our Gulf area, for example. \nBrian Nagel - UBS: And then as far as foreclosures, are those helping to drive better -- or I guess less bad results?\nFrank Blake: Yeah, I mean there is an advantage to existing housing turnover. That\u2019s something clearly that is relevant to our business and clearly a lot of the turnover in those areas has been from foreclosed housing. \nCraig Menear: We also see when you look at product categories, things like vinyl flooring, cleaning, in-stock carpet -- all of those businesses and compared to the total company are relatively strong businesses and we think that that\u2019s a combination of people that are beginning to fix up some of these homes but also the fact that there is high rent impact out there, where more people are renting. \nBrian Nagel - UBS: Okay. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Shannon Joseph with Wachovia.\nShannon Joseph - Wachovia Capital Markets: Actually, my questions have already been answered. Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Good morning. Two things as we think about 2009 -- first of all, I guess one for Craig, and that is as you think about the merchandising strategy in response to the consumer, can you just give us a little detail on categories or areas or price points or what you are thinking about proactively and how you are going to position merchandising? And then secondly for Marvin, if he\u2019s in the room, just a similar question for how you are thinking about staffing stores and service levels in anticipation of what you are looking at for 2009. \nFrank Blake: Okay. Marvin is in the room, so he\u2019ll respond to the second part of your question, Eric. Craig. \nCraig Menear: Eric, as it relates to kind of how we are looking at the merchandising piece, using our assortment planning tools, we are actually expanding the variety or clusters, if you will, of assortments that we are putting out there, trying to be more granular to approach specific customer needs and specific types of stores. So we have an improvement in, for example, in our seasonal areas of things like patio grills, power equipment, and so on, where we have put more clusters to be more granular.  Also, the other thing that we have focused on is really making the adjustments where we feel it was necessary and potentially shifting to stronger opening price point and mid-price points, and we have assorted accordingly as we move into 2009 to make those types of adjustments.  And then as I mentioned, we are also watching, because we think that there is potential upside where customers will in fact potentially opt out of services that they have around their home today and elect to do it themselves, and what we saw in snow equipment in the fourth quarter was that actually -- that translated into our better product selling at the top end of the line and we\u2019ll be prepared to make those type of adjustments to fulfill those customers\u2019 needs as well. \nUnidentified Participant:  Eric, good morning. This is Marvin. The second half of your question, we\u2019re really going to keep it very basic. We have spent a lot of time simplifying the stores, removing task and making sure that we are positioning associates in the customer facing areas of the business. So for \u201909, it\u2019s going to be a focus on training, as Frank mentioned earlier. We are going to re-orient and re-train every single associate on the fundamentals of customer service. We\u2019ve never done that before and we are going to focus on that in the first quarter. We are also going to make sure that we have our associates in the parts of the store during the times of the day that we have our greatest customer traffic and we are going to just focus on customer service. Our goal is going to be to execute well so that we can bring some of the merchandising events and new products to life with better service and just better associate know-how, so really taking [inaudible], customer service, and associate know-how will be the plan for 2009. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: And in terms of staffing levels relative to sales, is there any adjustment being made in the model?\nUnidentified Participant:  No, it\u2019s not -- I mean, we have an activity based system that is staffed based on departments, so an example would be when we have a department that is performing well, like our repair maintenance categories, you will see more associates in that area because sales are up. And when we have some [inaudible] that may be slightly down, you will see less associates based on the number of customers. So department by department, store by store, and we feel like that has served us well and we\u2019ll continue that for 2009. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: And then lastly on that, is there any change in the minimum staffing target as the sales continue to contract?\nUnidentified Participant:  No, because we staff based on departments, we don\u2019t look at minimum staffing by store. We focus on a department-by-department basis. If you look at our store, we are a store made up of many different, smaller stores. A hardware store, plumbing store, so we think a department-by-department focus is the best method for us to serve our customers. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Great. Thank you. \nDiane Dayhoff: Augusta, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: That question will come from Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan.\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Yes, made it in. I was going to say best for last, but -- so first to clarify, we\u2019ve received a number of questions about guidance, so it\u2019s $1.37, down 7% -- that\u2019s $1.27. Should we think about adjusting for that $132 million of one-time expenses in 4Q as well?\nCarol B. Tome: Yes, when we said on an adjusted basis, EPS would be down around 26%, we\u2019re adjusting out the expenses in 2008 and 2009, related to the business rationalization. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Right, so the point forecast is like $1.32-ish, something like that. \nCarol B. Tome: On an adjusted basis. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Right, yes, on an adjusted basis. Okay, that\u2019s perfect. And then can you talk of a follow-up question on the promotional environment -- you know, Lowe\u2019s results last week caused a lot of concern out there. Have you seen Sears pull back? What is Menards doing? Has Lowe's changed their pricing strategy? And then broadly on inventory, it seems like you guys are very clean. How do you think the channel looks and your other big retail competitors?\nFrank Blake: Well first, look, it\u2019s always a competitive market. I mean, we\u2019re always responding to customers, we\u2019re always out there trying every day to have the best pricing for our customers, so that\u2019s going to be the same in 2009 as it was in 2008. And in terms of our competitors inventory positions, I guess I\u2019m not really in a position to comment. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: From what you are seeing in the channel and the suppliers, do you think they are clean, so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a lot of inventory that needs to be cleared out?\nFrank Blake: In our channel?\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Yeah, your vendors.\nCraig Menear: I really -- you mean from the vendor standpoint, Chris?\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Yes. \nCraig Menear: Yeah, I mean, I think our vendors are probably in pretty good shape as we talk to them. You know, everybody in this environment is trying to watch how they manage their business, so I\u2019m not hearing anything from our vendor community that has them with dire concern over inventory position.  You know, and just one other comment as it relates to kind of how we are approaching the environment -- it is the job of our merchants to understand and anticipate where they think the market will go as they build their assortments for a given year, and we take into account what we think will happen the best we can and then assort accordingly, which is why we\u2019ve made some of the adjustments that we\u2019ve made within the line structures as we move into 2009. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then just one final one -- so then Craig, how have you ordered Spring on a year-over-year inventory basis?\nCraig Menear: We have -- \nFrank Blake: You know, Chris, I think that\u2019s probably not -- \nCraig Menear: More competitive information than I want to give out. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Chris. \nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you all for joining us and we look forward to talking to you at the end of next quarter. \nOperator: This does conclude our call. We would like to thank everyone for their participation. Have a great day."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-11-18 15:11:09", "content": "Executives:  Diane Dayhoff - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Frank Blake - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear - Executive Vice President, Merchandising Carol B.

(Operator Instructions) Beginning today's discussion is Diane Dayhoff, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nDiane Dayhoff:  Thank you, [Augusta], and good morning to everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot third quarter earnings conference call.  Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot, Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising, and Carol Tome, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst's questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors and, as a reminder, we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question and one follow up, please. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations Department at 770-384-2387.  Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake:  Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone.  Sales for the third quarter were $17.8 billion, down 6.2%. Comp sales were negative 8.3%. As Carol will describe, sales for the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $225 million because of the seasonal shift associated with 53 weeks in fiscal 2007. Adjusting for that, comp sales were negative 7.1%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.45. You all obviously know that this is a difficult environment in the housing and home improvement markets. The view we had at the start of the quarter, that we might be nearing a bottom - our August was actually better than we'd planned - gave way to the financial crisis in September and beyond.  We've seen the kinds of pressure you'd expect in this environment. Our big ticket sales are down significantly, as Craig will describe. Our customers are finding credit harder to come by, as Carol will discuss, and we're generally seeing continued softness in tough markets and erosion in previously strong markets.  Let me give you some specifics. Since the mid-September and forward time period is the most relevant, we look at the rolling six-week comp performance of our top 40 markets versus Q3 2007. Of those top 40 markets, only 15 are performing better now. So we are not seeing the improvement that we thought we'd see as we cycled against the soft comparisons from last year. And where we are seeing better performance, frequently there's only fractional improvement.  So, for example, Miami is performing better, but is still mid-teens negative comping. We've seen some improvement in California and New England but, again, these markets remain under pressure. At the same time, previously strong markets have eroded. Last year the Northwest was a relatively strong area for us. Now Seattle, Portland, and Spokane have negative double-digit comps. We expect that these pressures will continue into the fourth quarter and 2009.  In many respects the difficult market is obscuring the progress that our associates are making. Our customer service levels as reflected in our Voice of the Customer surveys continued to improve. Marvin Ellison, our Executive Vice President, U.S. Stores, has implemented significant changes in our store operations, making our approach simpler, more consistent, and more customer-focused. On the merchandising side, you can already see some of the improvements Craig and his team have accomplished. It's an enormous challenge to operate a business our size in a declining market with rapidly changing commodity prices and achieve price leadership, margin stability, and inventory control.  For the quarter, we launched a strong new lower-priced campaign, achieved significantly better markdown control, and lowered per-store inventory by 7.5%. I believe we have better execution in our business across merchandising, operations, supply chain and our supporting functions than we have had in quite awhile.  At the end of October we opened our fourth Rapid Deployment Center or RDC in Winchester, Virginia. RDCs now serve approximately 400 of our stores. We remain committed to enhancing our supply chain and are pleased to be back on the track of opening facilities. This year we have one more facility that we will open in the fourth quarter. Our International businesses, particularly Canada, have started to feel some of the economic pressures that we've had in the U.S. Canada had mid single-digit negative comps and saw a similar pattern of accelerated declining sales in the quarter. In addition, our Canadian team tackled a major business system implementation with SAP Core Retail, which is now live in all our Canadian stores - a substantial undertaking in the midst of very difficult market conditions. The rest of our business will now benefit from the learnings we can gain from the Canadian effort, and I'm very excited to have Matt Carey, who has over 20 years of experience with WalMart and eBay, on board as our new EVP and CIO to help us in that effort. China also reported negative comps, driven in large part by the impact of the Olympics in China in August.  But Mexico continued its strong performance with another quarter of double-digit positive comps. Across our entire business, we are making the adjustments necessary to respond to a tough market environment. We are carefully controlling our discretionary spending, scrutinizing every dollar of capital, and, most importantly, intensifying our focus on our customers. The culture at Home Depot is our strength, and I want to thank our associates for responding well in a tough time.  Now let turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear:  Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter we experienced negative comp sales growth in all departments except building materials, which was driven by strong sales in roofing and insulation. Both categories increased in the number of units sold, though it should be noted that some of the comp dollar gain in roofing was driven by higher prices due to increased petroleum costs. Additional departments that outperformed the company's average comp were plumbing, hardware and garden. The departments that underperformed the company average comp were kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical, lumber and flooring. And paint performed at the company's average comp. Average ticket was down $1.62 or 2.8% from last year to $55.86. We saw a decline in two areas. First, big ticket sales continued to suffer. For example, [special] kitchens were down nearly 30% versus last year. And second, we saw that approximately 40% of the decline in average ticket was due to lower average spending per basket. From a regional perspective, areas of the North, particularly the Northern Plains and Ohio Valley, performed above the company's average comp in the third quarter. The same is true for parts of the South, like Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.  The positive results along the Gulf are attributed primarily to hurricane-related sales. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike added approximately $125 million in incremental sales in the quarter; however, we did not realize any benefit to the bottom line as those sales were low margin sales and margin dollars were offset by additional expenses such as freight, store damage and associate cost. I am proud of the cross-functional team's efforts before, during and after the storms to ensure our products and associates were in place to help our customers and their communities. As Frank has said, in this challenging environment, we need to remain focused on executing and improving those things that we can control. We have discussed for several quarters the implementation of our portfolio strategy, and while we still have a long ways to go, we're starting to see the deliberative results. One such result was reflected in our transactions. While total company transactions of $315 million were down 3.4% year-over-year, we saw an improving trend during the last six weeks of the quarter.  One of our ongoing initiatives has been to reduce promotions and refocus our efforts on being an everyday value provider as part of our portfolio strategy. By the third quarter, we felt that we had accomplished enough in this transition to effectively communicate our progress to our customers. Our marketing campaign supporting our new lower price reinforces the everyday value message. Our new lower price program increased transactions and drove attachment sales. Another metric supporting the initial success of our portfolio strategy and overall merchandising transformation was our gross margin results. The third quarter presented the most volatile commodity market I've ever seen; however, we worked through it and we saw a 27 basis point improvement in gross margin over the third quarter last year.  Early this year we introduced new tools to our merchants to better plan, assort and react to changes in the market by forecasting at a more granular level. The clarity that these tools provided drove gross margin and inventory productivity, particularly in our seasonal categories. In the third quarter alone, we saw a 200 basis point gross margin improvement in our U.S. garden category due to lower markdowns. All the merchandising initiatives that I've described so far are also driving the results in market share. In the U.S., 6 out of 13 departments gained unit share in the third quarter, and 10 out of 13 showed share improvements from where they ended the second quarter. Based on independent third-party tracking of consumer activity, we saw strong share gains in several key merchandising classes. For example, insulation, carpet, ceramic tile, power tools, toilets, faucets, grills and molding all gained share in the quarter, to name a few. Many of these classes received concentrated merchandising focus and investment, utilizing our portfolio strategy. For example, in molding we updated the assortments regionally, refined the merchandising sets, improved the value proposition, and added point of sale information, making it easier for our customers to shop and make a selection. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect that we will continue to see relative strength in energy efficient and basic repair products. We have a compelling selection of value conscious and energy efficient products. We are positioned well in holiday products, including our expanded assortment of LED lighting, our gift centers have strong values in hand tool sets and power tools across varying price points, and we're ready to serve the storage and organization needs of our customers following the holidays.  In this difficult environment, we are focused on things that we can control and executing on them. We will continue to execute our portfolio strategy, make assortment and pricing adjustments, implement resets, and drive project sales by the way we position merchandise in our stores. We believe these actions improve the value proposition for our customers and simplify their shopping experience. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tome:  Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $17.8 billion, a 6.2% decrease from last year, reflecting negative same-store sales of 8.3%, offset in part by sales from new stores. Net earnings were $756 million compared to $1.1 billion last year. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.45 versus $0.59 last year.  Comp store same-store sales were negative 8.3% for the quarter, with negative comps of 6.5% in August, negative 7.4% in September, and negative 10.5% in October. The last three weeks in October were particularly weak. In fiscal 2007 we had 53 weeks in the year. This shifted our 2008 fiscal calendar. Because of this shift and given the seasonal nature of our business, third quarter sales on a like-for-like calendar basis were negatively impacted by approximately $225 million. Excluding the calendar shift, our likeforlike comp for the quarter was negative 7.1%.  Roughly 10% of our sales are outside of the United States. Late in the third quarter we saw significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all currencies. The impact to total sales was about $40 million. And similarly, from an earnings perspective, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar did not have a material impact in the quarter. In the third quarter our gross margin was 33.7%, an increase of 27 basis points from last year, and reflects the benefits arising from our focused-based portfolio approach as well as a shift in the mix of products sold. Specifically, our gross margin expansion was driven by the following factors: First, lower markdowns coupled with a smarter approach to promotions covered the cost of our new lower price program and drove 23 basis points of margin expansion. Second, a decline in the penetration of our lower-margin kitchen and appliance category drove 14 basis points of margin expansion. And finally, we experienced a contraction in our gross margin of 10 basis points resulting from clearance activities taken in connection with the one-time conversion of our Canadian stores to their SAP Core Retail platform. In the third quarter, operating expenses increased by 214 basis points to 26.3% of sales. Our expense deleverage reflects for the most part the impact of negative sales. Generally, we expect to deleverage expenses by about 20 basis points for every point of negative comp. In the third quarter, our expense deleverage per point of negative comp was approximately 17 basis points for a total of 144 basis points of deleverage.  Further, as expected, in the quarter we experienced an additional 70 basis points of expense deleverage due to a higher cost of credit associated with our private label credit card. In the third quarter, our total cost of credit as a percent of private label credit sales was approximately 2.2%.  Looking forward, our new private label credit card contract with Citi begins in January of 2009 and at that time the cost of credit will be capped at 1.5% of private label credit sales. As you know, a great deal of pressure has been placed on consumers and therefore retail sales due to tightening of consumer credit. Sales under our private label credit card made up 28% of our total sales compared to 30% one year ago. Today, over 70% of our new account applications are granted credit lines, but the average approval limit has decreased by 5% from last year. Further, in some cases existing credit lines have been reduced. So as we look out, continuing pressure on credit availability could potentially impact sales.  Our operating margin was 7.4% in the third quarter, down 186 basis points from last year.  Net interest expense was $151 million, an increase of $26 million from last year, reflecting a decline in interest income due to the lower interest rate environment and lower investable cash balances.  In the third quarter our income tax provision rate was 35.5%. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.1% for the year. Diluted shares were 1.69 billion shares compared to 1.82 billion shares last year. The reduction in outstanding shares is due to our share repurchase program and includes the tender offer we completed in September of 2007. At the beginning of the third quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $70 million. When the financial markets shut down, we put our recapitalization program back on pause and it will remain on pause until further notice. Now moving to our operational metrics, during the third quarter we opened 11 net new stores for an ending store count of 2,268. Today, 257 stores representing approximately 11% of our store base operate in Canada, Mexico and China. At the end of the quarter, selling square footage was 238 million, a 2.1% increase from last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot were approximately $296 for the quarter, down 8.5% from last year. Sales per square foot for our new stores were up 2.1% from last year. Now turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet and our cash position remain strong. At the end of the quarter we had $874 million in cash and no outstanding commercial paper. As a reminder, we have a $3.25 billion A2/P2 commercial paper program that is 100% backstopped by a committed long-term bank line of credit. We do not foresee the need to access the commercial paper market during the remainder of the fourth quarter; however, if we need to issue commercial paper, we believe the market is open to us at this time. We have approximately $11 billion of long-term debt of which $1.7 billion comes due in 2009. The average duration of our long-term debt portfolio is approximately 11 years.  We ended the quarter with $44.2 billion in assets. Since the end of the year, our cash position has increased by approximately $400 million, reflecting cash flow generated by the business of approximately $4.9 billion offset by $1.4 billion of capital expenditures, $1.1 billion of dividends paid, and $2 billion used to repay outstanding commercial paper and an operating lease obligation. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $11.9 billion, down 5.7% from last year. On a perstore basis, inventory was down 7.5%. Our operators and merchants have done an excellent job of controlling inventory in this sales environment. The quality of our inventory has never been better and clearance inventory is at a record low. Further, our in-stock level is at a record high. Reflecting the sales environment, however, inventory turnover was 4.2 times compared to 4.4 times last year. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital for continuing operations was approximately 11.6%. Excluding the store rationalization charge earlier this year, our return on invested capital was approximately 12.7%.  As we look forward we continue to project a challenging sales environment. We've been controlling what we can control, but November comps to date are about the same as October. Based on our year-to-date results, the stronger U.S. dollar, and our view that the consumer could be very challenged in the fourth quarter, we now believe that fiscal 2008 sales could be down as much as 8% for the year.  We continue to project that our earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the store rationalization charge will be down approximately 24% from last year.  We will share our 2009 guidance with you during our fourth quarter earnings conference call, which is scheduled for February 24. So thank you for your participation in today's call and Augusta, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.:  Craig, you said that 40% of the decline in ticket was due to lower spending per basket. I'm assuming the remaining 60% decline in average ticket, then, was due to mix - fewer large ticket purchases. Can you comment maybe how that compares over the course of the last, I don't know, year or two and what that implies in terms of how the mix impact is working on the average ticket?\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Yes, Colin. The balance was in fact the decline in average ticket. We're continuing to see pressure in big-ticket categories like kitchen and millwork that is impacting the overall average ticket. And I would tell you that in the third quarter, as we looked at those larger transactions above $500 or $1,000 - they took a step down to double-digit.\nCarol B. Tome: I'll just jump in on the appliance side, because I think this is important. If you look back in 2007 and 2006, we saw average ticket growth because of an increasing penetration of our appliances. In the third quarter we lost $0.17 in our ticket just due to appliance.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: And then the second question, I don't know if Matt Carey is actually on the call, but if he is -= and if he's not, maybe someone else can jump in - just in terms of what are the initial experiences with SAP in Canada, what you've learned and how you're thinking about those learnings in terms of U.S. IT implementation.\nFrank Blake: Colin, Matt is here so Matt, why don't you address it.\nMatt Carey:  Sure. You know, it's early days. We are just in the very end of the rollout. The team's been focused very hard in completing the rollout, and we'll be assessing the performance of those stores and that business in the coming year and learning as much as we can such that we can help the U.S. business as well.\nFrank Blake: And Colin, the one thing I'd say is we entered this with a number of questions and one of the first questions was could we do it? I mean, could we implement this without just a dramatic impact on the business because, frankly, you look at other big implementations like this and there have been some significant - beyond divots - huge potholes. And I think credit to the Canadian team and to Matt's team, you know, the implementation as an implementation, it's gone pretty well.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: It seems like you converted all the stores. There were no major snafus. \nFrank Blake: Right.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Up and running. And you're probably already seeing some initial benefits, I would imagine.\nFrank Blake: Well, again, tough as I outlined, Canada is seeing - you know, if you think about Canada, they've got some of the same issues in terms of impact from the auto industry, oil and gas. So it's way too early yet for us to be able to tease out what the benefits are as they wrestle with a tough market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC.\nPeter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC:  Again on the average ticket, it's been down the last nine quarters and I think the third quarter number puts us basically back to where we were in about the third quarter of 2004. When you look at the mix of your business and the stores today, what period would you say it's most similar to over the past several years? Is it like 2004 or is there some other year that we can look back to that would be more representative of what you're seeing in the stores today?\nCraig Menear:  I would tell you that as we look at the current decline in the big ticket, the change in our business from 2004 to now as it relates to appliances, I don't think you can really compare it to - I think the mix is different. So we've grown our appliance business significantly since 2004, and on the flip side, you know, in this current environment, the categories like kitchen cabinets are down significantly. So I'm not sure it's a fair comparison.\nFrank Blake: Peter, it really is tough because, as both Carol and Craig said, you've got to look at categories. I mean, I think of things like countertops that we were barely in in 2004 versus now.\nCarol B. Tome: More kitchen, flooring, the whole emphasis on specialties is very different. And that's our business model; it's just being impacted by the economic environment.\nFrank Blake: Correct.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Strasser - Banc of America Securities.\nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities:  So, quickly, when you look at the mix of stores around the country - the Northeast now is about 17% of stores; the Midwest, 10% of stores - you can make a good argument that those areas, based on what's happening in the economy, are going to get worse. When you look at some of the mistakes or some of the positive things you were able to do in areas like Southern California, Nevada, Florida, what have you learned that you can use to anticipate slowdowns as some of the things that are going on in those areas start to materialize.\nFrank Blake: So, David, I'd say - and this is more anticipation than direct experience at this point - I would expect that the dynamics are going to be different. So when you look at California, Florida, Nevada, you had just a lot of speculative homebuilding. You had strong employment, strong underlying GDP growth, but a housing bubble that had a direct impact on us as that bubble collapsed. I suspect we're going to be seeing a different dynamic play out going forward where it's less a housing bubble unwinding than it is a region dealing with basic difficulties on economic growth and employment. So just on your premise, we're not anticipating that it will be same-same and we can have hypotheses on how that will play out in our stores, but I think we're going to see a very different unfolding.\nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: Just as a follow up, at the beginning of the call you had said the Northeast. Could you just repeat what you had mentioned, how the business had trended there?\nFrank Blake:  Yes. The comment on New England was that it's better than it was, which is good, but I want to be very cautious in saying better is truly a relative term and that it's still under pressure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities:  So you said November was about where it was in October. Is that that 10.5% that you said for October? It sounds like the end of October was worse than the total October of 10.5%, so I just wanted to clarify where November was relative to that.\nCarol B. Tome: It's around the negative 10.5% area.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities: I think the sales guidance, the full year sales guidance, down 8% seems to imply down 18% for the fourth quarter. You have one fewer weeks so; you adjust that, maybe down 12% or 13%. You get a percent or two from square footage, so it sounds like the guidance for the comp, at least, is a little bit worse than down 10%, if my math is even close to right. So is that just being conservative, thinking things might drop off, or is my math just completely off?\nCarol B. Tome: Your math is right. What's included in our guidance is our view of the U.S. dollar's impact to our fourth quarter sales. You know, the U.S. dollar strengthened at the end of the third quarter so it didn't have a big impact to our third quarter, but we assume that the dollar will remain strong in the fourth quarter and that will have an impact to our sales outside the United States. \nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities: By a percent or two or something along those lines?\nCarol B. Tome: We're thinking about almost a couple percent.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets:  What has been the big change in terms of the sales trends in October/November? I'm sure it's just a continuation, but are we seeing incremental pressure on traffic or is it incremental pressure on ticket or is it both?\nFrank Blake: Well, I think I'll turn it to Craig, but as Craig was outlining, we actually feel like we're gaining some traction on the transactions, but just seeing continued pressure on ticket.\nCraig Menear: Yes, that is correct. We looked at transactions actually in October. We actually saw a significant change and improvement in transactions. But when you look at ticket in the month of October, that fell significantly. Ticket above $500 was double-digit off.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan.\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan:  I want to understand, you know, maybe how we should read the stat trend or the trend in the business as you enter the fourth quarter and try to get our arms around A) how do compares ease as you go from November to January, and B) how much should we read into or ascribe the shift down in comps to the fact that the seasonal and the maintenance categories, well, they just don't do as well when everybody's holed up in the winter, with the windows shut and the heat on.\nCarol B. Tome: Well, let me answer the first part of your question if I could. In terms of comparisons, looking at last year - and remember, there's a calendar shift that distorts some of this - but last year our comps were negative 6 - 6 in November, negative 7 - 2 in December, and negative 10 - 8 in January. So from a comparison, it would appear that January is the easiest compare.\nFrank Blake: In terms of your comment on the product assortment and what sells, the mix, it's going to be roughly the same year-over-year, that same shift away. Obviously, there are a lot of things like kitchen remodels and new flooring and the like that really slow down pretty significantly once you're past, frankly, this period, once you're past the Thanksgiving Day period. \nCraig Menear: And when you look at the seasonal impact of, like, the garden department, the big shift obviously comes from Q2 to Q3. It's much less significant Q3 to Q4. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: So maybe coming at it from a different angle, how much would you say because of that mix shift away from outdoor and from seasonal, how much of this is just a dip down because we're entering that time of year and how much might maybe we recover in the first half next year when you get into a better seasonal period?\nFrank Blake: Well, again, on the comp perspective, you're comparing same dip to same dip, and then obviously our business does pick up. January is our lowest month.\nCarol B. Tome: If you look at just total sales dollars, you should [inaudible] just because of the seasonal nature, and then it picks right back up when spring comes.\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: And a follow up question on SG&A trends. You've been basically keeping SG&A per foot flattish here in the first three quarters of 2008. How should we think about your ability to keep it flattish into 2009, either from a maintenance SG&A spend perspective or from stores on minimum staffing level?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, let me first talk about the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter we expect our expenses per average store to be down from what they were a year ago. Two reasons for that, primarily lower advertising spending in the fourth quarter this year versus last year, and then last fourth quarter you may recall that we had some write-offs associated with stores that we elected not to open. There was a big write-off for a store in San Francisco, if you remember that. We won't be repeating that in the fourth quarter, so expenses should be down on a per square foot basis. And as we come back to you at the end of the fourth quarter, we'll give you the guidance for 2009 and we'll let you know what we think about expenses on a per store basis. But clearly, this is an area of real focus.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: So, Carol, originally or last quarter you had given guidance of sales to decline 5% for fiscal '08. Now you're saying potentially an 8% decline, but we're keeping earnings guidance kind of down 24%. Is the major difference on the gross margin side or how should we think through that?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, we had a good earnings quarter in the third quarter; our earnings were better than our plan. So we're able to take that into the fourth quarter. And then as we look at the fourth quarter, you know, Craig's talked to you about the new tools that we're using that allow us to forecast sales margin and inventory now for 200 classes on a weekly basis. That's giving us better visibility on what we think the margin will do in the fourth quarter and that's giving us comfort for the guidance that we gave.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: And then also can you talk about your inventory performance in the quarter? Certainly very impressive, especially in light of the environment.\nFrank Blake: This is a joint effort of everybody on the team. I mean, it starts with Craig and his merchandising team and Carol and her finance team working with them on the planning process and Marvin on the store execution side and supply chain. I mean, it really is just - it's connecting a lot of - this isn't a very fancy answer, but it's just connecting a lot of dots within the business in a more effective way.\nCraig Menear: It's really the new tools are giving us great visibility and has changed how we manage the business. And quite honestly, when we look at the inventory overall, it was widespread. It wasn't concentrated in a significant or one area; it was widespread across all our merchandising departments.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: So, Frank, would you say it's a much more collaborative effort?\nFrank Blake: Again, yes. I mean, I think there are lots of opportunities for us to improve our operations, and these are the kinds of time periods that force us to get those. And as Craig said, you know, develop the new tools that help us communicate better within the organization.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: What are you seeing with regards to stores that are being serviced by the RDC network and, in terms of the RDC network, how shall we think about 2009?\nFrank Blake: Well, one of our - and Mark is here and he can address that as well - but when we put this on pause we had a series of benchmarks that we wanted to hit before we would start again, and one of them was how are we performing with the stores in terms of accuracy of shipments and how are the stores performing in terms of out-of-stocks, and we hit those targets, which is what gave us confidence to restart the rollout process. And our plan is to continue through 2009 and 2010. Mark, if you want?\nMark Holifield:  Yes, just that we had opened our Winchester facility. We're in our fourth week of operations there. We're experiencing no significant issues and pleased with the progress there. As Frank said, the main things we're looking at from a store perspective is the in-stock in the store and our RDC stores perform better than our other stores. We're looking at our ability to service the stores with very accurate loads and timely delivery. So we believe we're on track to achieve our ultimate targeted levels over time, so we're pleased with that progress. In terms of 2009, we want to continue until we can serve 100% of our stores and we're targeting 2010 for that completion, so you'll see openings in 2009 against that target.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alan Rifkin - Merrill Lynch.\nAlan Rifkin - Merrill Lynch:  Certainly it sounds like the price rationalization program has been pretty successful in driving transactions and units and revenues. My question is, though, taken together with the incremental marketing spend, has it been accretive to net income and, if so, what is your proclivity going forward to expand the program?\nFrank Blake: First of all, there wasn't an incremental marketing spend per se. It was a shift of how we were using our dollars to communicate to the customer. And overall, I think that as we look at the program, part of our portfolio strategy is to drive to an everyday great value for our customer, and we've been doing that by eliminating promotional activity that was non-nutritive.  And so we see this as an ongoing program. It's focused on our customer. It's focused on driving value to our customer every day and, as we look at this program, it's built in our guidance as we move forward. \nAlan Rifkin - Merrill Lynch: When you say it's an ongoing program, will it maintain the same level or will it be intensified?\nFrank Blake: As we look at the market and we look at implementation of our portfolio strategy, I certainly would not see it going backwards. As the market bears, we'll look at whether or not that intensifies. \nAlan Rifkin - Merrill Lynch: Where are you, Carol, with respect to minimum staffing levels at the store level? And going forward, if we continue to see a decelerating revenue environment, what is the opportunity to further reduce payroll at the store level?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, Alan, we staff by department, not by store. And Marvin Ellison is here, our Executive Vice President of Stores, and I'll let him address your question.\nMarvin Ellison:  As Carol said, we staff by department and not by total store, and really it's based on the rate of sales in that department. So if we have a department like plumbing, where sales is increasing, then we will beef up staffing. If a department has sales declining, we'll pull back staffing. The other thing we've done is that we've looked at customer shopping traffic patterns, and we focus our service during those timeframes. So we've been able to take the same number of associates and increase our service levels just based on when customers shop. So we think that that works for us and we're going to continue to strive with that model for the rest of the year.\nAlan Rifkin - Merrill Lynch: Okay, but at the departmental level, for departments that, going forward, let's say, come in below your plan, is there opportunity to further reduce labor within those departments or are you pretty much at the lowest staffing levels today?\nMarvin Ellison: We look at it case by case. And as it stands right now, I mean, we're not at any minimum staffing levels. We just try to maintain a certain level of service in our stores, and the reason why departments work is because it allows us to be granular and we can look at it department by department and make sure that we are flexing the necessary sources in areas where we need to to provide service. \nOperator: Your next question comes from T.J. McConville - Raymond James.\nT.J. McConville - Raymond James:  The first question I had was a follow up to a previous question on the call. Craig, I think you said that ticket above $500 was off double-digit in October. I was wondering if maybe we could get a sense for where that was in the beginning parts of the quarter or maybe where it was last year?\nCraig Menear: In the beginning parts of the quarter it was mid single-digit. We believe that there was some impact of that, particularly in September, as a result of hurricane sales and the repair that was happening in those particular parts of the country, but mid single-digits. And prior to that it ranged pretty much double-digit negative.\nT.J. McConville - Raymond James: And the second question I had was on the geographical regions. I know Frank gave us a pretty nice update at the beginning of the call on how things were looking. I was wondering if we could get a sense for the progression of decline throughout the quarter. Maybe a better way to ask would be did the bad markets sort of flatten out as things got worse and the good markets just got that much more bad or was it just an across-the-board deterioration for you?\nFrank Blake: I'll be honest, T.J., I don't have the time lapsed photography on that to tell you exactly how it played out, so I'd be guessing if I gave you an answer on that. And, again, you'd see a lot of variation from within the market. Some markets impacted more dramatically through the quarter than others. But honestly, I just don't have that in my head.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs:  As you disclosed the monthly comp numbers, are those impacted by the calendar shift as well or are those monthly progressions distorted or are they pretty clean?\nCarol B. Tome: The monthly comps that we gave you were the reported comps. I'd be happy to give you the likeforlike comps.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: That'd be great.\nCarol B. Tome: Okay. So we reported a negative 6.5 for August. The like-for-like was negative 6.2. We reported a negative 7.4 for September. The like-for-like was negative 5.3. And we reported a negative 10.5 for October. The like-for-like was negative 9.4. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: So negative 9.4 would kind of be the comparable number as you left the quarter?\nCarol B. Tome: Yeah.\nFrank Blake: Right.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Secondly, can you try to quantify the impact that International had on the business and maybe put that in the context of what you had seen year-to-date, I guess both overall and then currency, I think, probably hurt you at least a little bit in the third quarter, having helped you prior to that, so if you could help us understand that as well.\nCarol B. Tome: Yes. Our reported comp for the quarter was negative 8.3%. Our U.S. comp was negative 8.4%. So that gives you some sense of the positive impact that we've seen from our nonU.S. businesses has diminished.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: And then obviously make the calendar adjustments comparably.\nCarol B. Tome: That's right.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: And then the comment that you made at the outset, Frank, of 15 of 40 markets having gotten better, just to make sure I understand, you're actually seeing some sequential improvement in a number of markets, it's just not as many markets as you thought you might as the compares get easier and probably by a lesser magnitude where you saw that improvement.\nFrank Blake: That's correct, both statements. It's fewer than we thought and it's not as much as we thought.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: And then finally, the payables ratio looked like it was down a bit year-on-year. If you could share with us whether there's any rhyme or reason to that movement and what we should look for over the course of the year?\nCarol B. Tome: Yes. Our payables ratio was 57% compared to 60% a year ago. Last year you may recall we outsourced all of our payables processing to India. And candidly, we had some disruption. The 57% is where we think we should be. Now remember that at the end of each year there's always a low point in that ratio, so in the fourth quarter I would expect it to be around, call it 49%, something like that, and then it will build back up. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Your aggregate market share numbers, you talked about having gained share in a number of categories. As you look at that third-party source, is there an aggregate share gain or loss that they gave you and, if they did, how has that moved versus the year-to-date trend?\nFrank Blake: I don't think they do an aggregate.\nCraig Menear: They don't. They don't do an aggregate.\nDiane Dayhoff: Augusta, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Michael Lasser - Barclays Capital.\nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital:  Frank, at the outset you said you expect these pressures will continue into the fourth quarter of 2009. Maybe you could expand a little bit more on that comment and, if that is the case, will it necessitate a greater store rationalization program that you occurred earlier this year?\nFrank Blake: We expect it to be to the fourth quarter and into 2009, as I said. And, you know, look, we look every quarter at our stores and try to make sure we're doing the right thing in terms of the stores that we have open. And I would say as we look at our orange box stores, we don't see a dramatic change from what we saw in the first quarter in terms of the long-term value of those stores.\nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: And a follow up for Carol. You mentioned that the leverage or deleverage per point of comp is now down to about 17 basis points. Will there be an asymmetric leverage profile such that you'll get much better leverage once the comp turns positive and how are you thinking about that?\nCarol B. Tome: I'm looking for the day when that comp turns positive and, yes, there is an asymmetrical relationship as things start to move up. \nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: But it's hard to quantify at this point?\nCarol B. Tome: It is. We're working through that right now. And as you can appreciate, Michael, all our focus has been on running the business in this very challenging sales environment. As we look out, planning for positive comps - and that day will come - we'll come back and tell you what the leverage looks like.\nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: What has caused the downshift from the 20 basis points to 17 basis points?\nCarol B. Tome: Our 20 basis point rule is a rule of thumb. It's going to be around 20. I don't think it'll ever be exactly 20.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you when we release our fourth quarter earnings on February 24.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude our call. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation.

Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $21 billion, down 5.4%. Comp sales were negative 7.9%. As Carol will describe, sales for the quarter were negatively impacted by about $160 million because of the seasonal shift associated with 53 weeks in fiscal 2007. Adjusting for that, comp sales were negative 7.2%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.71.  I think you all are well aware of the difficult environment in the housing and home improvement markets, so what I would like to do is discuss the areas where we are focused on for execution and give you a sense of the progress we are making and the ground we still have to cover.  For the past 18 months, we\u2019ve been working on our five key priorities -- associate engagement, shopping environment, product excitement, product availability, and own the pro. I won\u2019t go through each of these but I\u2019ll highlight some of the key items.  On the product and merchandising side of the business, we have made significant progress. We have had better execution across the board. Craig and his team are implementing a portfolio approach to our merchandising efforts and this is already providing significant benefits.  In a time of increasing price pressure, they are managing through the areas where we need to protect critical price points for our customers and at the same time, they are addressing areas where we need to recognize the cost increases that some of our vendors are facing.  We are also managing our seasonal business more effectively. This allows us to redirect funds that would have been used in margin dollar eroding promotions and instead drive more coherent, better price points for our customers.  On product availability or supply chain, we have three rapid deployment centers or RDCs serving 300 stores. Although our current RDCs are meeting or beating most of the measurements of performance that we set out for them, we believe that full rollout will be more effective when we\u2019ve improved some of the key processes in the facilities. That is what we have been focused on over the last 90 days.  Obviously we\u2019d have preferred to keep to our initial rollout plan and to have hit no bumps in the road but this is a bump, not a detour. It impacts the timing in 2008 but not our overall timing. We remain committed to our RDC rollout strategy.  Our core retail pilot in Canada is now live in 36 stores with 20 coming online yesterday. It is going well and remains on track to be completed in all Canadian stores by year-end. Most important, we continue to make progress with customer satisfaction, whether we measure that through our voice of the customer surveys or through other third-party measurements.  One additional indicator that we\u2019ve looked at is something known as the net promoter score. The net promoter score looks at the percentage of customers who rate their shopping experience as nine or a 10 and subtracts from that the percent of customers who rate the experience as a six or worse. The theory behind this is that the best way to grow is to get more customers who are promoters and fewer who are detractors.  Our net promoter score has improved 480 basis points year over year and is now at 52.9%. Industry benchmarks say the best-in-class retailers have net promoter scores of over 50%.  We still have a great deal of room to improve but it is encouraging that the investments we are making in the business are starting to make a discernible impact with our customers.  On share performance, we have stabilized our share loss rate but we have not yet turned the corner on total share gain. Of the 13 major categories we look at, we believe we gained share in five but in some of the categories where we lost share, flooring, for example, we believe that we will reverse that loss in the remainder of the year. Long-term, we believe there\u2019s a benefit to our customers and our shareholders in driving to a compelling everyday value proposition, even if there are short-term share fluctuations.  As we look forward into the second half of the year, we see continued pressure in our markets. Housing and home improvement spend as a percent of GDP is now at 3.5% versus a 60-year historical average of 4.75%. From this data point on its own, you could foresee a near-term bottoming of the housing market but there are also pressures on the consumer from constriction of credit availability and increased costs of basic goods, so we remain cautious about our market in the back half of this year and into the first half of 2009.  From our own results, we see modest improvement in some of our markets. For example, we look at the percent of our top 40 markets that have positively comped in the quarter. In the third quarter of 2007, 20% of our top 40 markets positively comped. In the fourth quarter of last year, that percentage was 12.5%. In the first quarter of this year, the number was zero.  This past quarter, the number improved to 7.5% and two-thirds of our top 40 markets had better comp performance in the second quarter than the first. That is good news directionally. But some of that is undoubtedly due to the economic stimulus in the second quarter and may not be sustainable. It\u2019s also important to bear in mind that our guidance assumes modest improved comp performance though still negative through the back half of the year, if only because of the easier comparisons from the back half of 2007 and 2006.  One of the positives we see in 2009, as Carol will discuss shortly, is the renegotiation of our credit contract. We have finalized a new deal with Citi that will reduce the volatility in our cost of credit.  On the international side of our business, Mexico remains very strong. It has posted double-digit positive comps for the 15th straight quarter. That is an outstanding record and is a testament to Ricardo Saldivar and our great associates in Mexico.  Canada\u2019s performance was also solid though some of the economic ills of the United States have impacted them and they have posted low-single-digit negative comps. They were particularly affected in the areas impacted by the auto industry and the slowing economy in the Western provinces.  In China, we saw positive double-digit comp growth.  In that context, I would like to recognize our 37 associates competing in the Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer. We have men and women from across the business competing in everything from track and field to rowing and cycling. We are very proud of these associates, as we are very proud and grateful to all of our associates. We are transforming this business in the midst of a very difficult environment. We are investing in the core, betting controlling our operational and merchandising processes, and seeing significant improvement in customer service, all through the hard work and focus of our 300,000 plus associates.  We recognize our associates through a program called success sharing. At the end of the first half, 75% of our stores were eligible for success sharing and I am very pleased that we will be issuing success sharing checks in excess of $40 million, both company records.  Now let me turn the call over to Craig. \nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, all selling departments reported negative comps. Plumbing outperformed the company\u2019s average comp and seasonal and kitchen and bath were at the company\u2019s average comp. Lumber, building materials, hardware, flooring, paint, electrical, and millwork were all below the company\u2019s average comp and with the softness in these project businesses, average ticket was down 1.2% from last year to $57.58.  Total company transactions were $361 million, down 4.2% from last year. Transactions in the $600-plus range comped down double-digit while transactions of less than $25 were down single digits.  Regionally, we saw positive comp sales in the Southwest region, with every department in that region outperforming the company average. The Northern Plains region, while still negative, outperformed the company average comp in part due to the floods that affected the Midwest in July. While these areas are performing well, we continue to see double-digit negative comps in California and Florida markets for the fifth consecutive quarter.  Despite the challenging environment in the second quarter, I am particularly proud of our execution. We focused on controlling what we could control. We managed our business by continuing to implement our focus bay approach, where every category has a specific role and intent, driving assortment, pricing, and marketing decisions. This, along with the better tools that we developed this year allowed us to tightly manage inventory and gross margin dollars during the quarter.  For example, with our forecasting tool, we\u2019ve gone from forecasting sales, margin and inventory for 13 departments on a monthly basis to forecasting 200 classes on a weekly basis.  This type of insight helps us make better decisions with greater speed, which is invaluable when every dollar counts during these challenging times.  In addition, this quarter we continued to reduce promotions. We were less promotional overall compared to last year and consciously focused on eliminating margin eroding promotions. This is important as our customers are looking for great value every day and we want to simplify their shopping experience.  We have continued to see cost pressure in the quarter from price inflation in products that are metal and petroleum based. Our approach in dealing with this remains consistent. Each request is being handled individually with each supplier, since every situation is unique. Our pricing philosophy is to provide everyday great value and our retail pricing is set based on what the market will bear in conjunction with our focus bay approach, not cost.  Our improved execution through our merchandising transformation helped us offset the impact from cost pressure in the market during the quarter.  Despite the calendar shift, we saw solid sales in inventory performance in our seasonal businesses as a result of enhanced assortment planning at store level and tighter inventory management. Working with our new merchandising tools and our logistics partners, we planned and executed well in these businesses. For example, our home comfort categories experienced double-digit positive comp growth. Sales of air conditioning units and fans were up significantly as a result of the early hot summer experienced across much of the United States and we were able to respond effectively.  To put this in perspective, for the first half of the year our top seasonal classes, sales, gross margin dollars, and inventory productivity each performed two times better than the company average.  An area of relative strength remains basic repair. Customers are spending to maintain their homes. For example, in plumbing every major repair class in that department performed above the company average. We saw unit share gains against the market in several categories, including roofing, toilets, hardware, power tools and accessories, and electrical on a rolling 12 months, and all of these categories are essential to basic repair.  Additionally, we know that customers are value conscious and some customers are shifting their buying patterns to more opening price point products. We benefited by responding to our customers\u2019 needs and added more opening price point products to our assortments during the quarter.  Energy efficient products also performed well this quarter. In anticipation of high energy costs later this year, consumers are focused on energy conservation and we are already seeing customers begin to respond to these challenges by preparing their homes with these products. This is a trend we expect to continue in the third quarter. Products such as weather stripping, caulk, CFL light-bulbs, air circulation, pipe insulation, all performed well and in the Northeast, we are already seeing strong sales in our fireplace category as customers are stocking up on pellet fuel before the cold weather arrives.  As we head into the back half of the year, we are going to continue to pay attention to the trends in energy conservation as consumers further prepare to offset rising energy costs. We are introducing several new products, including the exclusive EcoSmart dimmable CFL light bulbs, water sense water saving faucets and toilets, and an innovative wall flush mount programmable thermostat from [Right Town]. In addition, we will continue to relevant Energy Star products, such as appliances, windows, furnaces, and water heaters.  2008 is going to continue to be challenging but the merchandising organization will remain focused on driving everyday great value for our customers using our enhanced merchandising tools and our focus bay approach.  And now I would like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol B. Tome: Thank you, Craig and good morning. In the second quarter, sales were $21 billion, a 5.4% decrease from last year, reflecting negative same-store sales of 7.9%, offset in part by sales from new stores. Earnings were $1.2 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.71 versus $0.77 last year.  Comps or same-store sales were a negative 7.9% for the quarter, with negative comps up 7.3% in May and negative 8.1% in each of June and July. Our comp sales were slightly higher than our plan, reflecting we believe some benefit arising from the economic stimulus package.  In 2007, we had 53 weeks in the year. This shifted our 2008 fiscal calendar. Because of this shift, and given the seasonal nature of our business, second quarter sales on a like-for-like calendar basis were negatively impacted by approximately $160 million. Excluding the calendar shift, our like-for-like comp for the quarter was negative 7.2%.  In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33.2%, an increase of nine basis points from last year. Our gross margin reflects higher supply chain costs that negatively impacted gross margin by 18 basis points.  As Craig mentioned, our gross margin expansion reflects better merchandising execution across all stores and this drove 23 basis points of margin expansion. And we had some benefit from running fewer credit promotions in the quarter, and that added four basis points to our gross margin.  In the second quarter, operating expenses increased by 188 basis points to 23.4% of sales. In the second quarter, we recorded an $18 million charge related to the store rationalization decisions that we announced in the first quarter. Excluding the store rationalization charge, we deleveraged expenses by 179 basis points in the quarter. Our expense deleverage reflects for the most part the impact of negative sales.  Generally, we expect to deleverage expenses by about 20 basis points for every point of negative comp. In the second quarter, our expense deleverage per point of negative comp was closer to 13 basis points as we experienced favorability in expense categories like advertising, medical, and workers compensation, among others.  Further, as expected, in the second quarter we experienced about 73 basis points of expense deleverage due to a higher cost of credit associated with our private label credit card. And while we are on credit, let me comment on our private label agreement. Last week, we executed a new contract with Citi, our third party service provider. The contract will go into effect on January 1st of 2009 and run through January 2017. We are very pleased with the terms and conditions of this agreement. We are moving from a profit sharing agreement to a fixed fee agreement with some upside opportunity . Effectively, the new agreement removes the volatility in our cost of credit and puts a cap on our cost. We are estimating that our future cost of credit as a percent of private label credit sales will be in the 1% area and in no event will it exceed 1.5% in any one year.  We will also receive an up-front cash payment of $220 million, which will be recognized as income over the life of the contract.  Now, our operating margin was 9.7% in the second quarter, down 180 basis points from last year. Net interest expense was $157 million in the second quarter, up $12 million from last year, reflecting a decline in interest income due to lower investable cash balances, offset in part by lower interest expense arising from a favorable tax settlement. In the second quarter, we had a favorable settlement with the Province of Quebec, the result of which reduced interest expense by $20 million and tax expense by $8 million.  In the second quarter, our income tax provision rate was 36.2%, due primarily do the favorable tax settlement, as well as lower state and foreign effective tax rates. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.4% for the year.  Diluted shares for the second quarter were 1.69 billion shares, compared to 1.97 billion shares last year. The reduction in our outstanding shares is due to our share repurchase program and includes the tender offer we completed last September. We didn\u2019t repurchase any shares during the second quarter, and as we have discussed, we plan to complete our debt financed recap once the market stabilizes but in the meantime, we may use excess liquidity to repurchase shares.  Now, moving to our operational metrics, during the second quarter we opened 15 new stores, including one relocation and as planned, closed 15 stores for an ending store count of 2,257. Today, 251 stores, representing approximately 11% of our store base, operate in Canada, Mexico, and China.  At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 237 million, a 3% increase from last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot were approximately $350 for the quarter, down 8.6% from last year.  Now, turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $11.9 billion, down 3.4% from last year. On a per store basis, inventory was down 5.9%. Our merchandising, supply chain, and operating groups have all worked hard to manage inventory while maintaining high in-stock rates and their efforts paid off. But based on the sales environment, our inventory turnover was 4.3 times compared to 4.6 times last year.  Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital for continuing operations was approximately 10.7% but excluding the store rationalization charge, return on invested capital was 11.6%, down 210 basis points from last year.  We ended the quarter with $45.1 billion in assets, including $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $605 million in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2007, and it reflects cash flow generated by the business of approximately $4 billion, offset by $960 million of capital expenditures, $760 million of dividends paid, and $1.7 billion used to repay outstanding commercial paper.  In June, we told you that our 2008 capital spending plan was $2.2 billion. We now believe that 2008 capital expenditures will be $2 billion, primarily as a result of the timing of 2009 new store openings. As of the first half of 2008, we have spent 48% of our $2 billion forecast.  Relative to our plan, we had a solid second quarter. Our financial results reflect a company that is managing its business in a difficult environment. The economic environment remains very challenging. Based on our first half results and our view of the back half, we believe that fiscal 2008 sales will decline by approximately 5% and fiscal 2008 earnings per share from continuing operations will decline by approximately 24%, consistent with the low end of our previous guidance.  Now please note that our 2008 earnings per share guidance does not include the store rationalization charge.  Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call and Augusta, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Daniel Binder with Jefferies has our first question.\nDaniel Binder - Jefferies: I was wondering -- could you give us a rough idea of what you think the tax rebate stimulus may have done for your sales in the quarter, either in dollars or on a growth rate basis? And then also, if you could quantify the benefits you think you may have seen from the Midwest recovery efforts due to the floods. \nFrank Blake: First on the tax rebates, this is -- we don\u2019t have a clear line of sight into it but I will give you kind of the ballpark of how we look at it, and this is -- we look at the $500 million plus shift in the first quarter, the $160 million shift in the second quarter, one to the negative, one to the positive, go okay, there\u2019s $400 million there and we think about three-quarters of it, so $300 million is probably related to the stimulus package.  And in terms of the impact on the Midwest, that\u2019s really -- it\u2019s at a level of immateriality, probably around $10 million. \nDaniel Binder - Jefferies: Okay, and then two other questions -- what was the contribution from international on the total comp store sales? And then, can you just remind us, Carol, what the cost of credit is this year so we can kind of figure out what the year-over-year benefit should be next year when you come down to something closer to 1%?\nFrank Blake: So international was around 140 basis points. Carol, on the credit. \nCarol B. Tome: And the cost of credit we estimate this year will be in the 2% area. \nDaniel Binder - Jefferies: And do you think next year will be closer to the 1 or the 1.5?\nCarol B. Tome: We\u2019ll give you a better idea as we get into the year. \nDaniel Binder - Jefferies: Okay. Thanks, I appreciate it. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Christopher Horvers of J.P. Morgan.\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Thank you and good morning. Can you talk about -- you know, it seems like it was a really good seasonal year here. You had stimulus checks, you had the weather drought recovery. Is there a way to look at your comps and say well, in the third quarter, if every category comped the same, how would your total comp change, given the mix change, ballpark?\nFrank Blake: Every quarter has a different profile in terms of some categories go down, obviously seasonal goes down a little bit in the third quarter and other categories go up. So I\u2019m not quite sure how to get a handle on your question of what -- Craig, do you want to give a shot at how that might look?\nCraig Menear: If you think about just the garden business, for example, there the penetration actually shifts from slightly over 21% to slightly over 13% but at the same time, then you have things like fireplace that comes up, other seasonal businesses that actually kick in. So I don\u2019t know that I can give you an exact number but there is certainly a change as a result of just the penetration of our garden business in the back half of the year. \nFrank Blake: Is that helpful to you? I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re answering your question. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Yeah, it is. I mean, maybe if you could say -- if you think about everything you do in your backyard in the early Spring to early Summer, any sense on how those categories comped relative to the rest of the mix?\nCraig Menear: Those categories actually performed above the company average in the quarter. Overall, as I mentioned, when we look at our core seasonal businesses for the entire season, the first half, if you will, they actually were two times better than the company average and we were certainly above what we anticipated in the quarter for those businesses. We actually exceeded our plans. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just one follow-up -- Carol, how should we think about the rest of the shift unwinding, the -- what was it, 290 basis points in 1Q, saw about 70 basis points in 2Q -- how does that play out in the back half, do you think?\nCarol B. Tome: It should be negligible. Most of the shift is behind us, just because of the nature of our seasons, as you were just pointing out. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Mitch Kaiser with Piper Jaffray has our next question. \nMitchell Kaiser - Piper Jaffray: Good morning. I was hoping you could give us a little more detail on what you are going to do on the processes around the RDC, and then maybe what we need to see before -- I think overall you were taking that to 20 over time. If you could just give us a little more color on that, that would be helpful. Thanks. \nFrank Blake: Sure, you bet, and we\u2019ve got Mark Holifield here in the room, so I\u2019ll turn that question over to Mark to address. \nMark Holifield: Good morning, everyone. Yes, we are slowing our 2008 openings but we feel we are on track for a 2010 completion where we would serve 100% of our stores. Our focus at this point is really ensuring a seamless rollout going forward, doing the right thing for our stores and our customers. The key things that we are focused on -- improving the in-stock at the stores, we\u2019re pleased with where we are there. The RDCs have improved the in-stock for the SKUs that are covered by RDC. We\u2019re improving our accuracy of shipments, the quality of timeliness -- and quality and timeliness of loads delivered to our stores and then our throughput productivity, and those are the things we are focused on as we go forward.  I would expect to see one or two openings between now and the end of our fiscal year. \nMitchell Kaiser - Piper Jaffray: Okay, and I think you\u2019ve said a goal that 75% of your COGS will go through either the lumber DCs, stocking DCs, or RDCs -- is that still consistent with that you are looking for over time?\nMark Holifield: Yes, our end goal is to have 70% to 80% of goods covered through central distribution. Keep in mind though that that includes, as you\u2019ve said, other DCs besides RDCs to get there. \nMitchell Kaiser - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck. \nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Good morning, everyone. Carol, you\u2019ve said that the second quarter relative to your plan was solid. Can you give us maybe a little bit more color on that and hopefully quantify some of that? Did you beat your own internal forecast in the second quarter and if so, at what line items?\nCarol B. Tome: Budd, we did beat our internal forecast. We beat our sales forecast, we beat our earnings forecast. Now, we did get a benefit from the Quebec settlement that I pointed out, which was $0.01 of earnings better than our plan but we were -- we had a solid quarter. And it\u2019s not just on the income statement. We were very pleased with the performance of inventory. We\u2019re managing inventory in a very difficult environment. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: So ex the Quebec settlement, can you give us an idea of how much you may have beaten your plan by?\nDiane Dayhoff: We don\u2019t give that type of information. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. I was just trying to get to where you were on a look-backward basis. Okay, one other question I have is just Craig, when you mentioned the performance to the comp average on all of the categories, you only had one that was above the company average in the quarter. Can you elucidate on that, maybe how much above or how that could work mathematically?\nCraig Menear: Again, plumbing was the one that was above the company average and seasonal and our kitchen and bath businesses were performing at the company overall. And when you look at the balance, we continue to see challenges in the project businesses and around those projects that are significant discretionary spend in particular or large projects, so that the reference that I made as it related to transactions above $600, you know, that\u2019s where we still continue to see the significant amount of challenge. \nFrank Blake: And I think just on the math, you\u2019ve got the higher penetration on our outdoor business, so when that\u2019s at the company average, that\u2019s how the math works. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay. Thank you, Frank. Thank you, Craig. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot and good morning. I want to get a little bit of color, Frank and Carol, on the comments you made about what you expect for the rest of the year. I think you said that your expectation is that comps will be a bit better in the second half of the year than they were in the second quarter. If you flow that through the P&L, I believe that the operating margin has to come under a little bit of incremental pressure versus what you saw in the quarter, so I guess given your macro caution, I\u2019m a bit surprised that you are as optimistic as you are on sales at the same time and wondering why the operating margin wouldn\u2019t improve a little bit from the implied guidance. \nCarol B. Tome: Well, Matt, as you pointed out, we do believe our comps will be slightly better in the back half than they were in the first half. And on the margin side, there are components of margins, first starting with gross profit. We said our gross profit margin would be flat to slightly positive for the year. For the first six months, I think we are up 14 basis points. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that we would repeat that in the back half.  And from an operating expense perspective, we did have some expense favorability in the second quarter that we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll repeat in the back half of the year. So when we added it all together, we thought a realistic view of our business for the back half was consistent with the guidance that we had previously given, which is sales down approximately 5% and earnings per share down approximately [24%]. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: And just to amplify those a bit, Carol, is the gross margin -- expectation of some gross margin erosion a function of product price inflation or is there something else impacting that outlook?\nCarol B. Tome: It\u2019s a function of a number of factors, including mix changes.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: And in terms of expense favorability, are there any call-outs that would get in the way in the second half of the year?\nCarol B. Tome: Nothing that\u2019s material, Matt -- it\u2019s a lot of one, two basis point type of activities. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: The second question that I have tries to dig a bit deeper into the distribution question. It sounds like the facilities that you have are doing okay versus your plan. You spoke about where you are going to focus your work in the existing DCs. I guess what was it that you saw that led you to slow down the rollout? There must have been something in performance or in your analytics that suggested you needed to do some more work here. \nFrank Blake: I\u2019ll give you my view on that, Matt, and also invite Mark to add his comments. As we have talked about before, when we opened the Dallas RDC, we saw that that had some significant operational issues in terms of what we had planned. And then we go back and you look at our pilot project in Braselton, the rollout in Chicago and Dallas, and you go gee, there are some significant process improvements that it would be good to make. And you have a choice -- you can say I want to make those significant process improvements as we go and keep to the original schedule or you go gee, this would be a good time to pause, get the operational improvements in now, and then roll.  And to be candid, we had a lot of discussion about that amongst our senior leadership team and the advantage of a rollout like this in my view is we\u2019ve got three RDCs up. It\u2019s kind of a perfect time to have that pause, get things really the way you want them before you continue the rollout.  And Mark can comment on this and we\u2019ve said it before -- this is a big undertaking. I mean, we are trying to do in a very short period of time what other retailers would take 2X or 3X the amount of time to do. It\u2019s valuable to -- the more you can replicate what you are doing and not have to make improvements on the run, the better off we think we\u2019ll be in the rollout and the easier the integration with the store side of this and the merchandising side. So that was the thought process and I\u2019ll ask Mark if he\u2019s got some additional comments to add. \nMark Holifield: I think Frank has summed it up very well. I think we are sure the concept is sound based on what we\u2019ve seen and we\u2019ve been pleased with some of the initial indications of success. The work we are doing right now is really to ensure that we can do a fast rollout and achieve our 2010 objective. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: I didn\u2019t mean to cut you off, Mark, but are there any financial consequences, positive or negative, in the short-run from the changing of timing here?\nCarol B. Tome: Not included in the guidance that we\u2019ve given. Clearly we\u2019ve secured some real estate that we\u2019re not optimizing. It\u2019s empty right now but that\u2019s factored into the guidance that we gave. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Understood. Thanks so much. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Colin McGranahan with Sanford Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Good morning. First, just on market share, it sounds like maybe a little bit of the improvement in momentum you had has stabilized here. It sounded to me like maybe the flooring category. Do you think that was just a function of some of the promotions that were run in the space? And if you could comment just a little bit more broadly on the general market share direction, especially relative to some of the competitive closings that we\u2019re starting to see from the independents and just your general outlook on where you think market share goes from here.\nFrank Blake: I think first, your comment on flooring, that is how we look at it and we see that in some other categories. Again, I\u2019d emphasize that one of the things Craig and the merchandising team are doing is really putting some discipline around driving to every day compelling value propositions, trying to pull ourselves off of a lot of the promotional activity that we were doing. And that\u2019s going to drive some short-term fluctuations in share but we think the long-term direction is right.  I think versus some of our competitors, we look obviously at there are differences by quarter and we are particularly pleased in the second quarter, if you kind of look at historically where we\u2019ve been in the second quarter, we think we\u2019ve picked up ground from where we\u2019ve typically been. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. And then just second, briefly on the cost of credit, assuming that you are down to 1% next year, my math would say that\u2019s like about a 30 basis point positive impact for next year. And then how did you -- that\u2019s excluding the three bps of the $200 million -- how did you possibly get a $200 million cash payment out of Citi at this point?\nFrank Blake: I think both sides, Colin, this is -- I think this is an instance where we\u2019ve had a good partnership with Citi over the last several years and we both sat down and worked out a new agreement that I think hit a lot of the concerns that they had, frankly, with our prior deal and addressed some of the concerns that we have. And Carol and her team did just an excellent job on I think setting the right path for the company on our credit agreement over the next -- you know, from 2009 through \u201917. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: And did you shop that competitively then?\nCarol B. Tome: We didn\u2019t shop it competitively but we utilized a third-party advisor who is an expert in this field to assure that the terms and conditions of our agreement are market or better, and as Frank pointed out, we really had the benefit of an open book with Citi over the past five years, which allowed us to mutually come to agreements that work really well for both of us. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Lasser with Lehman Brothers.\nMichael Lasser - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. As you look at it today, what percent of sales are related to basic repair items? You\u2019ve talked about relative strength in those areas for the last few quarters, so I\u2019m curious -- if you trend that relative strength out for the foreseeable future, at what point does the mix shift towards those categories drive overall growth in the total sales? Because at some point, you comp negative on top of negative and the basic repair items will continue or non-discretionary items will continue and that should drive positive growth as some point. \nCraig Menear: Michael, I can\u2019t give you an exact percentage as it relates to our business in total because these repair categories cut across several of our reporting departments. But certainly our focus, our main focus is to continue to certainly drive the project business overall, which drives attachment sales and as a result right now, we\u2019re seeing the consumer is certainly under these circumstances that they are facing with cost pressure in their own lives, basically focusing on doing things that they need to do to maintain their home, so whether it\u2019s replacing water heaters or replacing a roof our patching a roof when something happens to their home, they are certainly making those kind of decisions. But over the long haul, it is about driving the project business, which is what will then achieve attachment sales and drive comp performance over time. \nMichael Lasser - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. As a quick follow-up, as part of the new credit agreement, will any of the terms for new or existing cardholders be changed such that the availability of consumer credit under your private label program will be reduced next year?\nCarol B. Tome: Not per the terms of our new agreement but I will tell you that this year, we have made some changes -- we being the collective we. For example, where we saw delinquencies in the past, we had not reduced the credit line. This year, we reduced the credit line to the amount of the outstanding because we thought that was prudent in the current environment.  Further, we saw significant erosion in FICO scores and Citi pulls a credit report every month. There was significant erosion. There were some credit line reductions. But the more important aspect of all of this I believe is that we approve 68% of all credit card applications, so that continues to show us that the portfolio is robust. \nMichael Lasser - Lehman Brothers: Can you quantify in any way what sort of impact the change in terms or the change in philosophy might have had on either the sales result or the portfolio?\nCarol B. Tome: We don\u2019t think the change in terms has had a material impact to the portfolio other than it helps a bit on the profitability side. We are being more selective in the type of promotions that we offer. Our everyday value proposition is if you use our private label credit card and you spend $299 on the card, it\u2019s no interest, no payments for six months. From time to time, we offer 12 months no interest, no payment programs and we\u2019ve cut back on those programs a little bit. Have they had an impact on sales? We can\u2019t tell but we have cut back on the programs a bit. \nMichael Lasser - Lehman Brothers: Sounds great. Thanks for the commentary. Best of luck. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to David Strasser with Banc of America.\nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: Thank you. I know you had talked about the impact of gross margin on inflation and so on with vendors, but just from a bigger picture, not so much numbers, what are you seeing with your customer and your ability to pass that through? And what is -- and where are you with your vendors? And as you sort of look out into the back half of next -- early \u201909, do you think that gets to be a bigger issue for you guys, or do you think you are seeing kind of most of it now?\nFrank Blake: Let me make a couple of general comments and then turn it to Craig. So what we\u2019ve seen so far is you really almost have to take it category by category and vendor by vendor. So that\u2019s both in terms of how Craig and the merchants approach the vendor requests, as well as what we see on the customer reaction. And one of the things I think Craig and team are doing a very good job at is, as he indicated, focusing on opening price points and also focusing as there are necessary price increases and trying to add value in the product, along with the price increases.  Craig, maybe you want to add some commentary to that. \nCraig Menear: I think what we are really trying to do is obviously work, as Frank said, individually with our suppliers because each situation is unique but at the same time, really trying to apply our focus bay approach in terms of how and where we might pass on retail. And it\u2019s important to understand that from a merchandising direction that we\u2019re giving in our team, is your retails aren\u2019t linked to your cost. Retails are linked to what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and what our portfolio strategy says that we want to get done. And then we work the balance of that. Cost obviously is independent of that.  So right now, as we look forward, again certain things seem to be making moves. Lumber is starting to stabilize, it appears at this point. Framing lumber is not significantly different than last year, copper is pretty much flat to last year. Still obviously when you look at comparatives as it relates to steel or petroleum, there\u2019s certainly pressure against last year, and I think that pressure will continue as we go through the back half.  I\u2019m not seeing anything right now that would indicate that we\u2019ll see a dramatic fall-off in that. \nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: And just along those lines, I mean, looking at lumber, it\u2019s a good one. Not only is it stabilizing, it actually seems to be going up in price, just from when we look at it, as a lot of other commodities seem to be declining in value. Any thoughts to why that would be happening? Is there anything you are seeing from a demand standpoint that would be driving that?\nCraig Menear: Well, demand in the market overall with the current housing environment is down, so it is -- you know, it\u2019s kind of a -- it\u2019s strictly a supply/demand type of issue. So folks out there are trying to get what they can for the product that they are producing, so you are right. I mean, you are seeing sheet goods actually at a higher rate than the previous quarter. Dimensional lumber hasn\u2019t quite reached that point but it\u2019s close. \nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: It\u2019s just surprising to see that, I guess, in this environment where you see housing, so I just figured I\u2019d see. Anyway, thanks a lot. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Good morning. Two questions, I guess the first for Craig; on the EDLP focus you talked about or the comment was made that you gained share in five of 13 categories, or I guess lost share in eight of 13. Can you just talk about the rational benefit payback and commitment to continuing with this strategy and how you think that\u2019s going to play out in that market share performance as we move forward?\nCraig Menear: Again, we feel pretty strongly that listening to what our customers are saying through various research that we do, the customer is looking for us to simplify their shopping experience. The promotional activity complicates that for them. It focuses them into periods of time where they need to buy to feel like they\u2019ve got the best deal. It also puts pressure up through the supply chain, through our suppliers when you have that kind of activity. So we feel pretty strongly that over the long-term, by providing a great value to our customer every day and having them understand that we have that great value every day, it will drive the confidence level for them to shop with us. And so I think over the long haul, that should in fact pay out in share for the Home Depot. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: And how long is the long haul, do you feel? How long does it take until this process starts to really incrementally create value for you?\nCraig Menear: It\u2019s a journey, Eric. I don\u2019t know that I can fix a date out there. As we really work our focus bay approach and recognize that we have both assortment marketing, pricing elements to fix as we put those in place -- you know, this is a journey that we are going to take over the next probably couple of years. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Okay, and then second question on SAP, understand that you had 20 stores put up and running but I guess prior to yesterday, you still had 16 up and running. It seems like the rollout in Canada has been more deliberate, which makes sense but understanding how deliberate it\u2019s been up until yesterday, what gives you the confidence that you get through all of Canada by the end of the year and are there any experiences that have caused you to move at such a measured pace to this point?\nFrank Blake: So it\u2019s actually pretty consistent with what we had planned. I mean, the way the pilot was -- you know, it\u2019s kind of the geography of the pilot was you do a couple of stores, do a dwell time, do a limited number of stores, have a dwell time, and the you start hitting a more rapid rollout pace of 20 to 25 stores that have clipped, and that was always the way it was laid out, so -- and again, it\u2019s not that dissimilar from the RDC in terms of how you structure your pilot and initial rollout. There\u2019s a little bit of pause at the start as you shake out the bugs and make sure you\u2019ve got something that can really withstand a 20-store clip.  Now, we just turned those 20 stores on on Monday, so that\u2019s yesterday, so we\u2019re so far, so good. And if you can do 20 at a clip, then you can move it up to 20, 25 and easily make the end of the year. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: And through the first 16, has the feedback or implementation been basically where you thought it would be?\nFrank Blake: Yes. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Okay. Thank you. \nDiane Dayhoff: Augusta, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Thank you. That will come from Gregory Melich with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Carol, you mentioned before that there were a few things in SG&A that were favorable this quarter that you didn\u2019t see sticking in the back half. Could you sort of call those out or another way, look at the 3% growth in SG&A dollars -- is that a rate that we can maintain or is it going to go back to that more sort of 5% or 6%?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, we talked about favorability in a number of expense categories like advertising, medical, workers\u2019 compensation. I don\u2019t see that favorability continuing into the back half, for example. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and if we were to look at the growth from a dollar perspective, do you think the first quarter was more representative or is there -- because I mean, a 3% growth in dollars is impressive. We should be thinking about it is the fact that they grew a couple hundred bps more would be more normalized?\nCarol B. Tome: I think the first quarter is more representative than the second quarter. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And then a second question is the payables year over year -- I mean, the inventory looks nicely controlled. Also saw the payables come down. Is there something that was driving that uniquely or is it just the timing at the end of the -- or just fewer receipts? I mean, how should we look at that drop in payables?\nCarol B. Tome: Sure. The way you should look at it, and our payables ratio at the end of the second quarter was 60%, so that\u2019s pretty good but it is down from about 63% a year ago. And that\u2019s actually because of some transition disruptions we had a year ago. We outsourced all of our payable functions to India and ran into a bit of disruption as a result, which we don\u2019t like. We\u2019re back in line now in terms of our service level agreements with a third party, in terms of our on-time payments with our suppliers. And that 60% ratio is the one that we would like to maintain.  Of course, there\u2019s a seasonal element to that, as you know -- it will always drop off at year-end but then it should come back up to the 60% range. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And just one last, just as a follow-up to the first question -- if you talk about that 20 bps of deleverage that you\u2019ve used historically, as you go into next year, if it is another down year, do you think that that\u2019s still the right number or do you think that could end up being higher?\nCarol B. Tome: We just started our 2009 planning activities, as you can appreciate, and we are working off of that same 20 basis point rule of thumb. And as we get closer to the end of the year and we firm up our plans, we\u2019ll give you some more color. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. Thanks. \nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you to everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. \nOperator: That does conclude our call. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for their participation.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Beginning today\u2019s discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.

Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; Paul Raines, Executive Vice President of U.S. Stores; and Carol Tome, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors and as a reminder, we would really appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up, please.

If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our investor relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $17.9 billion, down 3.4%. Comp sales were negative 6.5%. As Carol will describe, sales and comps for the quarter reflect a benefit in seasonal timing due to the 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Diluted earnings per share were $0.21. That includes a $0.20 charge related to our decision to rationalize square footage growth in existing stores.  I would like to summarize what I see as the positives for the quarter and then talk about some concerns. First on the positive side, we showed significant improvement in the disciplines around our merchandising, as Craig will describe. We had better execution in our seasonal business and had better focus on moving away from promotional activity that confused our customers and undermined our brand.  We also took significant steps to restructure our workforce to provide more customer facing hours. Paul will go through some of these actions. We shut down call centers, we rolled out day freight receiving, we restructured our HR field team, and in each instance, we redeployed hours to customer facing activities. So a source of great pride that our 300,000 plus associates could take on so much change in such a short period of time in such difficult conditions and yet continue to drive improvements in customer service, as we are seeing in our voice of customers scores. These changes were necessary to adapt to current market conditions but they will also position us well for the future.  As we announced a few weeks ago, we took a significant step to rationalize our new store growth. The stores we are taking out of our pipeline weren\u2019t expected to meet our targeted returns. They would have diverted investment from our existing stores and negatively impacted our overall return to shareholders. By not building them, we\u2019ll free up approximately $1 billion in cash over the next three years to invest in maintenance, merchandising resets, and other areas within our existing stores.  We\u2019ll continue to open new stores in the future but we\u2019ll do so in locations that offer the best opportunity for long-term growth and profitability. We will be very disciplined in our capital allocation and very focused on the customer experience.  We continued in the first quarter to invest in our five key priorities -- associate engagement, shopping environment, product excitement, product availability, and own the pro. We have now opened three rapid deployment centers, or RDCs, and expect to roll out an additional five by year-end. We began piloting core retail in two Canadian stores at the end of March and remain on track to complete the rollout by year\u2019s end.  Our agenda for transforming the business is aggressive but measured. We are going to take some risks. We have to but we are also going to respond quickly to any issues we see. And it\u2019s encouraging that we continue to see positive trends on our overall market share.  We also continue to see strong performance from our international businesses. Mexico posted positive double-digit comps for the 14th straight quarter. Canada had positive comps, and we are very pleased that China posted positive double-digit comps. We feel that we have the right strategy there, start small and build up through success, and it\u2019s encouraging to see those stores performing well.  Now on the concerned side, we are still seeing relatively weakly demand for our non-seasonal products. And housing turnover, which is down over 30% from the highs in 2005, remains a concern. There\u2019s a significant inventory of homes to work through and the latest national association of realtors data shows home prices down 7.7%, with some areas of the country down substantially more than that. So the housing and home improvement markets remain very difficult.  At the same time, we are seeing significant pressure on the cost side as the price of basic commodities goes up and our customers are also facing pressure as they see the price of gasoline and food increase.  There isn\u2019t a well-worn path guiding us on what all these pressures will do to our business, but we certainly see on the general market side more risk than opportunities through the remainder of the year. So we are approaching the second quarter and the second half by focusing on those things we can control. We will continue to invest to improve the customer experience and we will show the discipline necessary to stop doing those things that aren\u2019t related to our key priorities.  One of our vendors said it well the other day -- it\u2019s time for those who are serious about this business to get serious about the business. That\u2019s a good description of Home Depot now. We are serious about the business and we are taking the serious actions necessary to position us for the long-term success.  Now let me turn the call over to Craig. \nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we experienced a negative sales growth in all departments except garden. Plumbing, while negative, outperformed the company average comp. As expected, the significant weakness in the quarter came from continued softness in big ticket and construction departments. Building materials, electrical, millwork, and kitchens all had double-digit comp declines. With softness in these project businesses, among others, average ticket was down 2.8% from last year to $57.36.  Regionally in markets where home prices have declined approximately 15%, we are continuing to see double-digit negative comps. This was reflected in our results in California and in Florida. Even garden, which posted a positive comp for the company reported negative comps in those areas.  While these two regions remain weak, there are a few areas of the country, such as the Ohio Valley and the Southwest region, as well as our international businesses that are helping to offset some of those declines.  We are also seeing pressure from commodity price inflation and deflation in the market, although pricing for wood products has stabilized, including dimensional lumber and sheet goods, which are now on par with pricing from last year, we continue to see pressure from gypsum deflation.  Copper pricing is up year over year and higher than we had anticipated. Additionally, we are seeing inflationary pressure from petroleum and metals, which is leading to cost pressure.  As we shared with you last quarter, we continue to see strength in the basic repair categories, with comps less negative than the company average. We know that during difficult times, customers will continue to make essential repairs in their home. As a result, we focused our activity on improving our line structures and understanding customers\u2019 repair needs.  A good example is assortment adjustments that we\u2019ve made in hand tools, power tools, and plumbing fixtures, all which resulted in share gains in the quarter.  Another area of strength this quarter stemmed from our execution in our seasonal business. We are pleased with the results of our spring seasonal categories which posted positive comps for the quarter. Live goods, handheld power, chemicals, fertilizers, and landscape performed well and seed and lawn d\u00e9cor posted double-digit positive comps. These results were driven by continued line structure improvements and new innovative products such as Pennington\u2019s Smart Seed, which requires 30% less water and Vigoro\u2019s Super Green, a slow release fertilizer that will last up to five months.  Large contributors to the comp increase in live goods were the expanded offerings of the proven winners brand and growth of our eco-options products, which include vegetable and herbs in plantable, biodegradable pea pods.  While we\u2019ve made progress, we continue to have opportunities to improve line structures and product offerings. For example, in the second quarter we will invest in several categories where we have lost share, particularly ceramic tile, bath faucets, and bath fixtures.  We will reset ceramic tile and bath faucets and we will enhance our assortment of bath fixtures.  We continue to drive merchandising transformation, and while it is still early, we are starting to see a difference in our business when we align the right people, processes, and tools. Investments made in our associates, both in the field and the store support center, are starting to pay off.  With the team in place, we made significant progress in improving, and in some cases creating crucial processes. We remain committed to implementing our focused approach to finding the role and intent of each category which drives our assortment, pricing, and marketing strategy.  In addition, we have also provided our merchants with improved tools that deliver significant benefits and time savings for the merchandising team, maximizing assortment and forecasting visibility.  These investments are beginning to show results and for the last rolling 12 months, we have experienced unit share growth in several categories, including patio, paint, hand tools, and carpet.  In patio, we provided great brands at exceptional values, as seen with our exclusive Thomasville and Hampton Bay lines, and our share gains in paint are all about new product innovation and execution at store level.  Last year we started down the long-term path to return to our merchandising roots, providing everyday compelling values to our customers. By focusing in on our merchandising fundamentals with this objective in mind, we were able to better manage our gross margin dollars. Our gross margin productivity in the first quarter was the result of better assortment planning, visibility created by our new tools, a change in promotional strategy, and improve seasonal inventory management.  As we head into the summer, we are pleased with our seasonal lineup and feel that we are well-positioned in patio, grills, mowers, and power equipment. We feel that the merchants have captured the change in customer preference in our air movement category with our new portable air conditioning units and diverse assortment of environmentally friendly products under our eco-options line.  And we continue to provide great values and innovation in emerging products, like fresh air paint, the only true odorless and VOC, or volatile organic compound free paint in the market.  Before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to welcome Frank Bifulco, our new Chief Marketing Officer, to the merchandising team. Frank brings 30 years of marketing experience to the Home Depot and a strong consumer brand management background from his years at Hasbro, Timberland, and the Coca-Cola Company.  2008 is going to be another tough year but we have a strong merchandising team focused on our fundamentals who will continue our promise of delivering everyday value to our customer.  And now I would like to turn the call over to Paul. \nPaul Raines: Thank you, Craig. As Frank mentioned, we are focused in in-store execution and improving customer service. We executed a number of transformational changes in the first quarter. In the past, the types of changes we made this quarter would have taken years. It is a shift in philosophy that has allowed us to increase the rate of change and improve execution. I would like to take a few minutes to share this philosophy.  Our approach is to seek out best practices from those who are closest to the customer, our stores. As we identify opportunities, we assign a field leader to develop the concept and implement this in their region with support from our corporate staff. Once proven in the field, we implement across our entire chain, with field leaders taking ownership for success in their area.  We have found that our approach is highly efficient and can be implemented at a high rate of speed. In this environment, moving with velocity to transform our stores and better service customers is vital.  One of our main initiatives is aprons on the floor. This program is geared at investing in our stores by adding more selling hours to the floor through better expense allocation. Our goal in 2008 is to reallocated $180 million to add more sales hours to the stores. There are several areas where we have redeployed resources. Let me take you through a few of the more significant changes we have made.  Based on a recommendation from our field teams, in February we rolled out our day freight initiative to over 1,100 stores. The purpose of this was two-fold; to increase associate availability during our peak selling hours and provide more ownership of inventory management to our department supervisors. This initiative changed our receiving and recovery time from overnight to early morning and evening shifts to allow us to have more associates on the floor assisting customers.  This was heavy lifting but we were able to accomplish it with little noise because of the personal involvement of the field team.  Along with the change in receiving, we also empowered our department supervisors. We returned inventory management responsibilities to department supervisors who have greater visibility and knowledge about product needs.  This is the most significant change to our operating model since the SPI, or service performance initiative, in 2000.  During the past five years, the Home Depot has standardized and institutionalized our human resources function across the organization. In April, we told you that we were going to restructure our field human resources function and as of May 1st, we replaced our in-store human resources manager with district-based human resources teams.  Sometimes we need to restructure to reinvest. We are committed to prudently managing our expenses and taking action where we can to hit our $180 million goal to reinvest in associates.  We know motivation and engagement of our more than 300,000 associates make a huge impact on customer satisfaction and on sales. We continue to focus on recognizing and rewarding associates.  Despite the difficult environment, we are continuing to reward associates through our success sharing and Homer Badge programs. We have not given out over 410,000 Homer badges. We are also proud to say that we now have 3,000 master trade specialists, all licensed plumbers or electricians, in our stores.  As you know, we have taken steps in the past year to refocus our training efforts back to hands-on, in-the-aisle learning. During the quarter, we introduced a product knowledge badge. This new badge rewards associates through cash compensation for completing 100% of the product knowledge training in their departments and adjacent departments. Associates that complete this training are better able to help our customers with projects that cut across multiple product categories.  Our associates are reacting positively to the changes they are seeing. We know that taking care of our customers and each other by investing in our stores and associates is the right thing to do. Our voluntary turnover continues to decline at a double-digit rate year over year and our store associate tenure continues to increase.  In terms of shopping environment, we are pleased with our progress. As most of you know, the average age of our stores is around eight years old, a time when you really need to refurbish the stores to continue to drive sales.  We have adopted a programmatic approach to maintenance and will continue to spend significantly more in 2008 than the historical trend.  We are operating a large complex organization. In a business this size, driving changes requires simplification and consistency in our approach. As a result of our investments, we are seeing results. We continue to see improvements in our VOC survey, where we hear from more than 115,000 customers a week.  We know 2008 is going to be a difficult year. We remain committed to executing the fundamentals, our key priorities, and to investing in our associates and customers.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol B. Tome: Thank you, Paul and hello, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $17.9 billion, a 3.4% decrease from last year, reflecting negative same-store sales of 6.5%, offset in part by sales from new stores.  We reported earnings per share of $0.21 in the quarter, which reflect a charge of $543 million, due to the recently announced closing of 15 stores and removal of 50 stores from our future growth pipeline.  For the purpose of today\u2019s call, we are going to refer to this charge as the store rationalization charge. Excluding the store rationalization charge, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.41, down 14.6% from last year. Our first quarter comp sales decline was slightly worse than our plan. Comps or same-store sales were negative 6.5% for the quarter, with negative comps of 6.4% in February, negative 8.7% in March, and negative 4.9% in April. Comp sales remain negative in May but are running in line with our expectation.  In 2007, we had 53 weeks in the year. This shifted our 2008 fiscal calendar. Because of this shift, and given the seasonal nature of our business, first quarter sales benefited from a seasonal timing change. The calendar shift added about $524 million to first quarter comp sales. Adjusting for this, comps would have been negative 9.2% for the quarter.  In the first quarter, our gross margin was 33.9%, an increase of 14 basis points from last year. Our gross margin expansion is due principally to lower markdowns than last year. While it isn\u2019t material, our gross margin expansion is net of a five basis point, or $10 million impact of markdowns associated with inventory in our 15 closing stores.  The calendar shift did not impact the gross margin rate but drove gross margin dollars. For the quarter, the calendar shift resulted in approximately $0.04 of year-over-year earnings per share growth.  In the first quarter, operating expenses increased by 508 basis points to 29.8% of sales. Excluding the charge of $533 million related to our store rationalization, operating expense increased by 211 basis points to 26.9%. Our expense deleverage reflects the impact of negative sales, where for every point of negative comp we expect to deleverage expenses by about 20 basis points.  The negative comps in the first quarter resulted in expense deleverage of approximately 115 basis points. Further, as expected, in the first quarter we experienced an additional 96 basis points of expense deleverage due to a higher cost of credit associated with our private label credit card.  Operating margin was 4.1% in the first quarter, down 495 basis points from last year. Excluding the store rationalization charge, operating margin was 7.1% in the first quarter, down 192 basis points from last year and in line with our plan.  Net interest expense was $164 million in the first quarter, up $4 million from last year. In the first quarter, our income tax provision rate was 36.9%, reflecting the impact of the store rationalization charge. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year.  Diluted shares for the first quarter were 1.68 billion shares, compared to 1.97 billion shares last year. The reduction in outstanding shares is due to our share repurchase program and includes the tender offer we completed last September.  We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter and the completion of our recapitalization plan remains on pause as we are waiting for stability, both in our business and the credit markets.  Now moving to our operational metrics, during the first quarter we opened 26 new stores, including two relocations for an ending store count of 2,258. Today, 247 stores representing approximately 11% of our store base operate in Canada, Mexico, and China.  At the end of the first quarter, selling square footage was $237 million, a 3.9% increase from last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot were approximately $305 for the quarter, down 7.4% from last year.  Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $12.6 billion, down from $12.7 billion last year. On a per store basis, inventory was down 4.6%.  As you heard from Craig, this year we instituted a new seasonal inventory planning process and as a result, our seasonal inventory levels are in good shape relative to the sales environment. But based on the sales environment, our inventory turnover was 3.9 times compared to 4.2 times last year.  Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital for continuing operations was approximately 12%, down 240 basis points from last year due to the decline in our operating profit and the store rationalization charge. Excluding the store rationalization charge, our return on invested capital was approximately 13%.  We ended the quarter with $45.6 billion in assets, including $779 million in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $322 million in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2007, reflecting cash flow generated by the business of approximately $2.4 billion, offset by $530 million of capital expenditures, $379 million of dividends paid, and a $1.2 billion repayment of outstanding commercial paper.  First quarter earnings were in line with our expectations. As Frank mentioned, we do see certain headwinds ahead. While it is early in the year, today we are more comfortable with the low-end of our EPS from continuing operations guidance of down 24% from fiscal 2007. This guidance does not include the store rationalization charge.  We are holding our investor conference on June 5th and look forward to covering our business performance and prospects with you at that time.  Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call and Connie, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Deborah Weinswig from Citigroup.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Good morning. Craig, you talked about providing the merchants with improved tools and how these tools helped improve visibility. Can you go into that in a little bit more detail? And also compare what they were using a year ago with what they are using now?\nCraig Menear: Sure. What we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve provided some new assortment planning tools to the merchants that really helps them in terms of the difficulty it was to plan below a market level, so we were able to plan really down to a store level in several of our categories, and that\u2019s a pretty big significant enhancement for them.  At the same time, one of the other new tools we updated or upgraded a forecasting tool that our merchant and finance teams use, and that provided greater visibility to overall forecasting and actual results that allows us to act faster. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Great, and then as a follow-up, Frank, it sounds like between the hiring of Frank and also adding Brian Cornell to the board that there\u2019s an increased focus on advertising and marketing. Can you talk about what we should expect going forward with regard to these two initiatives?\nFrank Blake: Well, as Craig said, we are very happy to have Frank come on board and he just brings a lot of experience, and clearly for a company like ours, marketing, which broadly defined is a deep understanding of our customer, is absolutely critical and we are looking at that -- we are looking to be best in class in that.  And we also have some strength on the board to give us advice and counsel -- Brian Cornell, Al Carey, and Bonnie Hill and others who really have good, strong marketing backgrounds. So it is -- again, I hope this company will be characterized by the extent to which we understand our customers\u2019 needs and fulfill them. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Thanks so much and congratulations. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Wayne Hood from BMO Capital. \nWayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets: I\u2019m not sure you want to talk about this, but could you discuss a little bit how you are getting your hands around the disruptions at the regional distribution centers, particularly Dallas as we come up on the Memorial Day weekend and in light of the rollout that you expect by the end of the year? And then Craig, could you talk about your market share in flooring, the changes you made a year ago and has that really resulted in an increase in share in flooring?\nFrank Blake: So on the first one, we\u2019re happy to talk about the issues. We have had some issues in a number of our initiatives as we have rolled them out, and as I tried to say in the overall comment, look, we know we are moving quick and we are asking the organization to change a lot. We know we will stub our toe occasionally but we also are committed to responding rapidly  What I would is Mark Holifield and then Paul Raines too to comment on the situation in the Dallas RDC, and then Craig, you should address the back half of Wayne\u2019s question. \nMark Holifield: Just to refresh everybody\u2019s memory, we are moving very quickly from about 20% central distribution penetration to about 75%, so it\u2019s a very aggressive supply chain transformation. Our target for this year is to end up serving about 40% of our stores with about 30% of their cost of goods sold. And with any major transformation like that, you do encounter some bumps in the road. We did encounter some with [Bradenton], we encountered some with our Chicago opening, which we did January. We opened up Dallas in March. It was the most aggressive opening that we\u2019ve done so far, with about 180 stores served, going right into our spring peak. So we did see some more disruption than we desired there but we do feel we are getting our hands around that. We are on the road to recovery there and we expect that we will have that back on track. Don\u2019t see any major issues for the Memorial Day selling period and we do see ourselves as on track for the 40% of stores and 30% of cost of goods sold targets by the end of the year, so we are working it and expect to see that behind us soon. \nPaul Raines: And Wayne, this is Paul. On the store side, we know that transforming our supply chain is vital to our success, so we\u2019ve been preparing our stores in advance of the rollout. Specific to the RDC situation, Mark and I are in touch and working very closely on this on a day-to-day basis and there is a significant amount of support from our stores team with that RDC team really integrated on the ground, working through the issues together. As Mark says, this is a company with a high rate of velocity, so anything we do has a lot of complexity with it and I am really pleased with what our team in the Southwest has done to support the supply chain organization. \nCraig Menear: On flooring, I have shared with you in the past that we were losing share. That really started in the flooring business somewhere around the mid part of 2005. We were losing as much as 300 to 400 basis points to the market. We\u2019ve been able to turn that in Q1 and actually have a positive share growth for the category in total, and for a few quarters now, we\u2019ve actually been able to see positive growth in carpet, ceramic tile, and laminate. \nDiane Dayhoff: Connie, next question. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to David Strasser for Banc of America Securities.\nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: Thank you very much. So after the store closures, 15 of them, as you continue to look at that, how should we be thinking over the next say one or three years about the store base? Are there more to come as you look out?\nFrank Blake: David, we did a very thorough review of our stores, and maybe Carol will describe it a bit, but we were focused on trying to get at one time all the stores that we didn\u2019t think made economic sense for the company to be operating. So it\u2019s not as though there are a whole series of other stores that are on the bubble, or where action is imminent. We really think throughout our 2000-plus chain, these were the 15 stores that needed to close, and that\u2019s -- it\u2019s not a huge percentage on that kind of a store base and we feel pretty good about that number. \nCarol B. Tome: We went store by store, started by looking at our stores that are older than three years, because those are stores that are mature, but we decided to look at every store. So in fact of the 15 stores that we are closing, three of those stores are younger than three years old, so it was a very thorough analysis. \nFrank Blake: Now having said that, obviously things can change but we\u2019ve taken as good a swing as we could at the time. \nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: And I guess on a related basis, I guess one of the things that seem to be changing is there seems to be just a lot of independent store closures. I guess Lowe\u2019s talked about that yesterday, you guys have talked about it. How does that -- do you have any sense of what percent of the market has gone away over the last 12 months? I don\u2019t know how you would judge that, and if so, does that change how you would sort of think about opening stores even going forward?\nFrank Blake: First off, no, we don\u2019t -- I mean, we don\u2019t have a good number on what that might be and it really doesn\u2019t change what our view is on future store openings. I mean, the best that we get is anecdotal data, so probably the same as others get. \nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: And do you know exactly what day the housing market is going to bottom?\nCarol B. Tome: Oh, please tell us. \nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: Because if you know, it would be -- that\u2019s the question we get, so -- \nFrank Blake: It\u2019s August 8th. \nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: Excellent. \nFrank Blake: Of what year -- \nDavid Strasser - Banc of America Securities: Thank you very much. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lasseter from Lehman Brothers.\nMichael Lasseter - Lehman Brothers: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions, and as long as we are on the subject, perhaps you could us if we are going to win the Triple Crown or not. But two questions -- first, how are you thinking about the balance between preserving financial flexibility in this time by targeting certain leverage ratios, such as lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR and the other end of the spectrum of stewarding capital to the highest return investments? Because there could be an opportunity or a disconnect between the period when perhaps the financials haven\u2019t caught up but yet the stock price has rallied and there is a window of opportunity to purchase the shares at an attractive level. \nFrank Blake: I\u2019ll ask Carol to answer that in more detail but obviously that\u2019s something we focus quite a bit on and hope -- you know, in the first instance, that is, we look at our business and look at all of the underlying signals that we get between geographic signals and signals in particular kinds of classes and sub-classes of product that we can build up a confidence level on what the market is doing and do that in a timely fashion.  Carol, you may want to comment as well. \nCarol B. Tome: Last year we completed a thorough analysis on the question of financial flexibility and determined that our capital structure based on the maturity of our company needed to change from one that facilitated growth to one that facilitated capital distribution. And we determined that we wanted to measure that through an adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio of 2.5 times, and that is our target. Today we are at 2.1 times if you look at it on a trailing 12-month basis.  Part of our capital structure strategy, of course, was to recapitalize our company and we announced a $22.5 billion recapitalization plan, of which we\u2019ve completed about 50%. The remaining recapitalization plan is on pause just because of the instability of our business and the instability of the credit markets. But obviously we are looking at this very closely every day. \nMichael Lasseter - Lehman Brothers: Okay, and as a quick follow-up, can you reconcile the commentary that in the press release that many areas of the country worsened during the period and then perhaps on the call you mentioned that May was running in line with plan?\nFrank Blake: Well, we have planned for some negative performance, so what we are seeing is roughly what we anticipated. \nMichael Lasseter - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Is there any -- I guess is there some of the regions that had been stronger, are they starting to experience weakness due to perhaps economic factors?\nFrank Blake: Yeah, I\u2019d say -- I mean, generally, because it\u2019s obviously something we look at very closely in terms of the different regional performance, areas that have been hit hard in the past, Florida and California come immediately to mind, continue -- I mean, it\u2019s hard to see a lot of improvement there. We\u2019ve got other areas that had been relatively strong that have declined a bit, and then as Craig called out, we\u2019ve got some areas of strength, like the Southwest and some areas in the Midwest where there wasn\u2019t -- where both there\u2019s stronger economic activity now, like in the Southwest there\u2019s not so much speculative activity in the past, like the Midwest. \nMichael Lasseter - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions, best of luck. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Colin McGranahan from Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Good morning. I just have two brief ones today -- first, Carol, I may not have heard you right about the impact of the credit card business? I thought I heard you say 96 basis points. Is that correct?\nCarol B. Tome: That\u2019s correct. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: So that seems substantially higher than I think what your expectation was for the full year. Is there any kind of seasonality or can you talk a little bit more about how the delinquency trends are and the credit contribution is flowing relative to your prior expectations?\nCarol B. Tome: There is a bit of seasonality but I will say that only as it relates to the profitability of the portfolio in that a year ago, we were enjoying excess profits from our gain sharing arrangement and we had none of those excess profits in the first quarter of this year. So the year-over-year comparisons are going to be tougher in the first half of the year than they will be in the back half of the year, so hopefully that helps you. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Yeah, that makes sense. Obviously those profits deteriorated through the years, the delinquency rate stepped up sequentially. So was the overall delinquency or charge-off rates largely in line with your expectation to date?\nCarol B. Tome: It\u2019s running a little heavier actually, or a little higher. The good news, if there is good news in this environment, it seems to have stabilized. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, and you -- that, just so I understand that correctly, once your gain sharing is zero, it\u2019s zero, right? You can\u2019t actually have negative gain sharing?\nCarol B. Tome: Our arrangement is a profit sharing arrangement. In excess, we share in the profits in excess of a targeted return. If the targeted return is not achieved, then we could have to pay more for the cost of the credit. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. And then just again, a brief question, seasonal impact through the year -- what should we expect in the coming quarters in terms of impact on sales 2Q, 3Q, 4Q, roughly? And operating margins?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, the good news is that by the end of the year, there won\u2019t be any impact. It will all work out but clearly if you have an extra week of spring in the first quarter, you are going to have one less week of spring in the second quarter. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: And then just a -- so the same 13-weeks, whether you started in the February week or ended in the April week, that was that roughly negative 9.2 comp? \nCarol B. Tome: If you do a like-for-like comp, that\u2019s correct. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. Great. Thank you so much. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions, if I could -- on the comp store sales, if you could talk both about your U.S. only comps excluding China, Mexico, and Canada, and also if you could talk on the comp store sales side about whether the monthly numbers were distorted by either the calendar shift or by Easter.\nFrank Blake: Well, I\u2019ll let Carol give the specifics but there were -- I mean, there was an Easter impact but obviously over the course of the quarter, that eased out and there would also have been some shifting impacts on the month. I don\u2019t know that we actually kind of broke that out for you, but we gave you the overall number. \nCarol B. Tome: I\u2019m sorry for jumping in, but Matt, the way we look at it is relative to our plan. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: I guess the reason I ask is because your competitor was out with numbers yesterday that were more volatile month to month with April showing a much bigger improvement. I\u2019m wondering if your business was more consistent through the quarter or whether it was actually, when you put aside the calendar shift, a little more volatile than it looks on a reported basis? \nCraig Menear: Maybe I can add a little bit of light to that. As we looked at the numbers in April last year, remember we had a couple of really horrendous weeks with weather. Our numbers in those weeks were sub-double-digit negatives, so we were nowhere near as down as much as what our competitor reported yesterday in those two weeks, which we think is what really is the difference in April in our performance versus theirs. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Understood. And one quick follow-up -- on the expense line, as we measured it, your retail expenses per foot or per store excluding the charges were essentially flat, maybe up a little but I guess we could do the credit card work on our own and kind of back it out, but if you look at that at the store level excluding the credit card impact, is that down kind of low to mid-singles, or low singles in your view?\nCarol B. Tome: It is. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: And is that consistent with where you\u2019ve been or perhaps a little more of a pull-back on SG&A?\nCarol B. Tome: It\u2019s a reflection of the store count, the expenses that we have associated with store count. You know, we are only opening 55 stores this year. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Understood. And the payroll, if you look at store payroll per se and you look at the either dollars per foot or leverage versus say last quarter, do you know what direction that moved in?\nCarol B. Tome: It was flat to slightly up. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: The dollars or the ratio?\nCarol B. Tome: The ratio. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks so much, guys. \nCarol B. Tome: Matt, we didn\u2019t answer your question on U.S. only comps, and we\u2019re happy to do that. If you look at the contribution from our businesses outside of the United States, as Frank pointed out we had positive comps everywhere outside the United States. The contribution in the first quarter was 1.9%, about the same as it was in the fourth quarter. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: So it\u2019s basically unchanged from where it\u2019s been. Thank you so much. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. As you think about the business, Frank and Carol, you are kind of describing a leaner, and a lot of the announcements that we\u2019ve seen, a leaner and a meaner Home Depot that is more in touch with the customer at the store level. Can you talk a little bit about what expense difference that means, maybe from the store service support center? I know there have been some actions taken there and obviously you talked about the call centers as well. How should we think about the overall overhead going forward and when does that show up in the numbers?\nFrank Blake: Well, the first thing, Budd, to point out is as we were going through a number of the actions that we\u2019ve taken like the call centers, like restructuring our field HR teams, like the day freight, we actually put those savings or hours back into the store. We reallocated back to customer-facing activity. So as a leadership team, we looked at this and said we know we need to address as one of our first priorities and key priorities associate engagement and this is -- that\u2019s one of the sets of activities we are going to be taking to address the need to improve our coverage on the floor. And that\u2019s going to be an ongoing effort. So Paul and his team, he\u2019s got a whole group that is focused around what we call aprons on the floor where people come up with ideas on things we can do better, cheaper, faster, whatever it is and then how we redeploy that into hours on the store.  We will always have opportunities, I suspect, in terms of our SSC here in getting our organization sized correctly to support the business. We took a very significant action a few months ago and look, all of our jobs here is to figure out how best to support the stores and how to do a better job tomorrow, which means being able to do it for faster and cheaper than we are doing today. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay. And as you described what was going on with the field leaders, it almost sounded like a store Kaizen events, if I can put it in that term. How many field leaders are there? How many of those kinds of initiatives and events are there going on? Can you quantify a little bit of that for us?\nFrank Blake: Let me ask Paul to discuss that. \nPaul Raines: Sure, Budd. I think what\u2019s going on in this aprons on the floor, and we\u2019ll add some color to it at the investor conference but this is our own continuous improvement. Kaizen is a good term. This is our own program to generate thinking around how do we find solutions for customer service.  So our team literally is receiving hundreds of ideas on a weekly basis. We are taking action on those. The large ones you\u2019ve heard about -- underneath those, there are several others that are smaller -- method improvements, process improvements, et cetera. But as Frank said, this is part of a multi-year framework to reallocated and reinvest in our customer service levels on the floor. So you will hear us at the investor conference talk about that multi-year game plan to continue this process. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Well, you and I have talked about that in another venue and I am all for that. I think that is a great thing to do. My last question, if I could, is just piggy-backing a little bit on Colin\u2019s question about the 96 basis points of higher credit. Carol, if you could maybe talk a little bit about that, how that played out month by month over the quarter -- I know you may not want to give us the actual granularity on it, but was the -- did that increase or decrease as the quarter unfolded?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, we actually account for the profit sharing at the end of the month. We don\u2019t do it each month. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: So you do it at the end of the quarter, not just at the end of the -- \nCarol B. Tome: Yes, at the end of each quarter, yes. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay. All right, thank you very much. \nDiane Dayhoff: Connie, we\u2019re ready for the next question. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Gregory Melich from Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: A couple of questions; one, Carol, you said it was $0.04 is what the week shift implied. Am I backing into that right, that\u2019s it about a 20% variable margin, those sales?\nCarol B. Tome: That\u2019s right. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And is it fair then to say that that\u2019s what you see in the second quarter the other way, or how does that play out towards the end of the second quarter?\nCarol B. Tome: We\u2019ll explain it to you when we get done with the second quarter. We\u2019ve got to see how the numbers come in. It really depends on the top line. \nDiane Dayhoff: But yes, there is a change, yes, you are right. \nCarol B. Tome: Of course, yeah. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And then, not to beat credit like a dead horse, but we\u2019ll try -- if the gain share goes away and then you don\u2019t take losses from that, but if you start paying it say in a few, 2% or 3% as opposed to 1%, does that then show up in gross margin? Is that the way the accounting works?\nCarol B. Tome: No, it\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that, I\u2019m sorry. There are three components of our cost of credit. There\u2019s the deferred interest component, which is the fee we pay for our no interest, no payment programs, and our everyday value proposition is if you use the card and you spend 299, it\u2019s no interest, no payments for six months. That deferred interest is accounted for as a cost of goods sold.  Then there are two other components. There is the gain share, which is a profit back to us and an interchange fee, which is a charge to us. And when you add it all up, the gain share and the interchange is in our selling and store operating expenses and when you add it all up, the deferred interest, the gain share, and the interchange, you get a cost of credit.  In 2007, our cost of credit as a percent of credit sales -- and remember, credit sales are about 30% of our total sales, our cost of credit in 2007 was less than 50 basis points. In 2008, our plan is that it will be 200 basis points or 2%. And we stress tested this and we don\u2019t think it would be any higher than 4%. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: That is and at some point though, you could see some of that showing up in another line but that overall number is helpful. \nCarol B. Tome: It\u2019s going to be in the same line, deferred interest, which is in cost of goods and then selling and store operating. Deferred interest isn\u2019t going to move. That\u2019s a fixed fee, if that\u2019s helpful. It\u2019s really how profitable is the portfolio. That\u2019s where you could see movement and it would be in our selling and operating expenses. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Got it, perfect. And then third was rising fuel costs -- where does that show up? Is it SG&A or is it in cost of goods sold? \nCarol B. Tome: It\u2019s in both. It\u2019s in both. Obviously it\u2019s in our cost of goods but we also within SG&A, we have delivery expense. Delivery expense would be a factor of fuel expense, so it\u2019s in both lines. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. Thanks. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Michael Baker from Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. So first question on gross margin -- so it was better this quarter because of being less promotional. Any expectation on the trend going forward? I think, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but a year ago you were a little bit more promotional in the first quarter and then you did back off on that throughout the year, so should we expect that same kind of gross margin gain going forward or is that going to change?\nCraig Menear: In terms of the promotional activity, we went in and we really took a hard look at the promotional activity itself and what we were getting from that. And when we looked at about 10% of the promotions driving about 80% of the lift, that wasn\u2019t a great return on the other 90%. So that\u2019s where we became much more rational in terms of what we were doing with the promotions themselves and we obviously benefited from that.  As we look at what\u2019s going on with overall inflation, particularly as it relates to fuel, that\u2019s where we are seeing pressure and we think that will certainly translate into some pressure overall in our margin but we are going to do our best to offset that for the customer, obviously. \nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: Okay, thanks. And then if I could ask one more question just on May, you said it\u2019s in line with plan. I think your previous plan at the beginning of the year was for comps to get better throughout the year. Does that include the second quarter -- but then, of course, you have the negative calendar shift, which was apparently within your plan, so that would make the second quarter plan worse than the first quarter. Just wondering if you can help us there, put that into context. Should the second quarter, plan to be better or worse than the first quarter?\nCarol B. Tome: Sure. Because of the calendar shift, our second quarter should be our worst comping quarter of the year. \nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you very much. \nDiane Dayhoff: Connie, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our final question from Daniel Binder from Jefferies.\nDaniel Binder - Jefferies: Appreciating the fact that the quality of the labor is changing, I was wondering if you can maybe quantify, either on a comp basis or a total hour basis, what the increase or decrease in hours, labor hours has been year over year? And the second question was related to store-wide market share; could you give us any comments on that? And then lastly, just wondering if you are pleased with the consistency of the in-aisle training and whether or not the loss of the HR function at the store level will be disruptive in that. \nFrank Blake: Let me take those in reverse order. On the consistency of the in-aisle training, and whether we will lose something from the loss of the HR imposition in our stores, the first thing I would acknowledge is we will lose something. I mean, these are trade-offs that we make in terms of some of the operational benefits in the store versus our belief that we do need to reallocate labor and do some restructuring on our workforce to provide better service for our customers.  As Paul indicated, we are very focused on training. We\u2019ve got a new program we are rolling out in terms of product knowledge badges, rewarding associates for -- so the question is a very fair question. It\u2019s one we focus on and as I said, every time you do these decisions there are downsides and the best we do is address the downside as well as we can.  On your second question, if I understood that, that was kind of our general market share -- was that your question?\nDaniel Binder - Jefferies: Yes, just if you look at unit market share across all categories for the whole store, are you losing or gaining share. \nFrank Blake: So I\u2019d say the way we look at it, there are roughly 13 -- we look at 13 categories and we are gaining or holding our own in half of them. And we see that as improvement. We know we\u2019ve got a hill to climb here, so we see that as improvement. Craig and his team, along with everybody else on the senior leadership team, we\u2019ve identified areas where we think we can gain market share, turn that around and we feel good about our plans to do that over the remainder of the year.  And then your last question on sales per hour, I\u2019m not sure. \nDaniel Binder - Jefferies: Well, I was trying to just understand quantitatively, if you were to look at labor hours per store, are they going up at this point on a comp basis or are they just declining less than comps?\nFrank Blake: Yeah, they -- and for sure again, and it varies, and Paul can discuss the labor model but there\u2019s a -- or maybe will take you to a level of detail none of you wants to go, but it obviously varies store by store on what the sales are in the particular store, but it could be just exactly as you said, that what\u2019s happening is just the hours are declining at a lower rate than the sales. \nPaul Raines: In a negative comp environment, if you are in a store that\u2019s negative comping, you know, the actual store customer traffic is decreasing. That store will have less associates in it.  But when we talk about our aprons on the floor campaign, that $180 million that I referenced is we are -- our goal is to add the equivalent of three full-time employees selling hours to each store. Some of that will be a reallocation of tasking that we have made more efficient. Some of that will be incremental spend in the store based on the cost reductions of the call centers in HR, et cetera. So it\u2019s all a combination of efforts to put more selling hours in front of each customer than we would have had otherwise. \nDaniel Binder - Jefferies: And are you making the progress you had hoped to on the master trades hires? Is that still a top priority and where do you expect that to be this year?\nFrank Blake: I think it\u2019s a very exciting program for us. As Paul indicated, we\u2019ve got over 3,000 master trades specialists. As you would expect, and as we would expect, this is not an investment that you see an immediate return on but we are very pleased with how that program is going and we think it relates very directly to the foundation of Home Depot, that knowledge, that deep knowledge in the store, so we are pleased with the program. \nDaniel Binder - Jefferies: Okay, great. Thanks. \nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you, Connie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to our speaking with you if you are coming to Atlanta for our conference in early June, otherwise we\u2019ll talk to you in August. Thank you. \nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference.

Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analysts' questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors and as a reminder, we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up, please.

If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our investor relations department at 770-384-2387.  Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided in the financial statements included with our earnings release.  Now, let me turn the call over to Frank Blake. \nFrank Blake :  Thank you, Diane and good morning everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $14.6 billion, essentially flat to last year. Comp sales were positive 1.2% with our U.S. stores posting a negative 1.1% comp for the quarter and our international stores contributing a positive 2.3% comp.  Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.18. As Carol will detail we had some unusual items impact our fourth quarter earnings. In particular, the write down of our remaining equity interest in HD Supply. Adjusting for the impact of HD Supply earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.24.  Our business improved more than we expected in the fourth quarter. Of our top 40 markets in the U.S. all but two showed improvement in the fourth quarter on a comp sales basis. Every one of our regions showed comp sales improvement in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and our Northern Division, our largest division with eight regions had a positive comp for the quarter. We also saw sequential improvement in California and Florida with a return to positive comps in some of the markets there.  Our business also performed very well in Canada in the fourth quarter with double digit positive comps. This was a function of four things; better performance by the business, recovery from a rocky start last year with the new enterprise IT implementation, improving economic conditions and a government stimulus program designed to support homeowners updating their houses. In Mexico the business once again achieved positive comps for the quarter and the year despite a very tough economic environment.  We also made solid progress on our key initiatives. Last month we opened our 12th Rapid Deployment Center (RDC) in Topeka, Kansas. RDCs now serve over 65% of our U.S. store base and we are on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of 2010. Craig and the merchandising team continue to develop and integrate our merchandising pools and we can already see some of the benefits of improved assortment management and forecasting in our inventory and markdown control. As Matt [Carey] our IT leader has described, we are years behind other retailers in these areas but we are on a path to catch up over the next five years. Given the success we have seen with our internal tools we are not contemplating any third-party U.S. based enterprise wide system.  Marvin and our store operations team made a significant statement last year by retraining all of our associates, everyone, on customer service launching our Customer First program. Our net promoter score improved 800 basis points over the year and is now at almost 70%. We gained over 100 basis points of market share for the year, something we have not done in quite awhile.  So all of this gives us some cause for optimism in 2010. At the same time we recognize we have more work to do as a company and that the economy is not out of the woods yet, particularly in our market. So we are not projecting robust growth. Private fixed, residential investment as a percent of GDP has stopped its dramatic and historic decline but still remains well below the 60-year average. The housing industry remains at distressed levels, mortgage defaults continue to increase, unemployment remains high and our Pro customers are still under pressure. Our expectation is that 2010 will be a transitionary year.  For the year we are anticipating approximately 2.5% sales growth and 15% growth in earnings per share from continuing operations. We expect to see relatively flat growth in the first half of the year with more momentum in the second half.  Calling the year transitional doesn\u2019t sound very exciting but we have been waiting for this transition for a long time. We made the decision three years ago to focus on our core business and invest in our stores and associates during a difficult economic environment. We have returned to the core values of our business and we are proud of the fact that even in the tough economic environment of 2009 we had record success sharing for our hourly associates. In fact, in the second half of 2009 93% of our stores qualified for success sharing.  Going forward we will continue to invest in our associates and our business and we will also continue to focus on disciplined capital allocation and increasing shareholder return. Today the board of directors and I were pleased to announce our first dividend increase since the third quarter of 2006, reinforcing our confidence in the business and our commitment to our shareholders. It is our intent to continue to increase our dividend every year. Further, it is also our intent to use our excess cash to repurchase shares, again evidence of our disciplined approach.  I want to thank our associates for all of their hard work in 2009 and their commitment and dedication in the year ahead. With that let me turn the call over to Craig. \nCraig Menear :  Thanks Frank. Good morning everyone. We are pleased with our continued progress in the business and performance in the fourth quarter. We saw significant improvement across many product categories and regions as well as key performance metrics including comp sales transactions and big-ticket sales. Kitchen and bath, paint, flooring and plumbing delivered a positive comp and we flat comped materials garden and millwork. Lumber hardware and electrical reported negative comps. Total customer transactions were $288 million in the fourth quarter, up 2.1% compared to last year. Transactions per ticket of $50 and below, roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., were positive 3.2%. This increase was driven by continued strength in basic DIY repair and maintenance products such as plumbing, cleaning and light bulbs.  In addition we saw strength in simple d\u00e9cor projects which led to positive growth in categories like ceramic tile, hard wood, interior paint, faucets and bath fixtures which also contributed to our overall transaction growth in the quarter. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, which also represented approximately 20% of U.S. sales was down less than 1%, a significant improvement compared to the double digit declines in previous quarters in 2009.  This improvement was largely driven by a stronger than anticipated response to outstanding values in categories such as appliances, water heaters and windows. We were also pleased with the positive trend in our installed sales.  Our total company average ticket for the fourth quarter was $50.01, down 1.7% from last year. Our comp average ticket declined by 1%. The improving trend in total average ticket was driven by the improvement in big ticket transactions as I mentioned earlier. The average ticket also benefited from strong sales in Canada resulting in part from a Canadian tax relief on a large selection of home improvement products. However, while our trends are getting better we continue to experience pressure in big ticket construction related categories such as dimensional lumber, concrete, gypsum, pneumatic tools and fasteners.  We are executing our merchandising transformation to provide great everyday value to our customers. From where we started we are 1/3 of the way through the implementation of our portfolio strategy and the continued use of merchandising tools allows us to enhance and optimize our performance. This coupled with our supply chain transformation to get the right product in the right place at the right time was the foundation behind our solid quarter performance.  The success of our seasonal business is a great example of how we leveraged our merchandising and supply chain transformation during the quarter. The combination of better planning tools and solid execution drove strong performance against our plan in products such as snow removal, fireplace and decorative holiday. We finished the year in a clean inventory position of seasonal goods while having spent less on mark downs compared to last year.  Investments in our portfolio strategy, merchandising tools, supply chain development and customer service drove continued market share growth in the quarter. Our U.S. market share has grown over 100 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis despite closing our Expo businesses in early 2009. Based on an independent, third-party tracking of consumer activity we gained unit share in 6 of our 13 departments during the quarter.  As we look forward to 2010, we are well positioned across the entire store. We will meet our customer\u2019s needs in energy efficiency and conservation by offering them products such as the best rated bulbs on the market, a water sense rated faucets across our entire product line up. For indoor and outdoor projects requiring power tools we offer the leading cordless brand for Pro\u2019s with Dewalt along with a strong exclusive power tool lineup including Milwaukee, Makita, Rigid and Ryobi.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol Tome :  Thank you Craig. Hello everyone. Our financial results for the quarter are distorted by a few factors that I would like to discuss and get out of the way before I cover our results.  First, we reported $41 million of earnings from discontinued operations primarily related to our working capital settlement with HD Supply. For the purpose of today\u2019s discussion we will focus our remarks on earnings from continuing operations. Earnings from continuing operations  International comp growth of 2.3% was offset by negative comps in our U.S. stores of 1.1%. Total company comps were positive 1.2% in November, negative 0.2% in December and positive 2.2% in January. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 0.3% in November, negative 2.3% in December and negative 1.5% in January.  For the year our sales declined 7.2% to $66.2 billion. Excluding the impact of sales related to the wind-down of our Expo businesses and adjusted sales for the year declined 7.5% to $66 billion.  For fiscal 2009 total company comp sales were negative 6.6% and comps for U.S. stores were negative 6.2%. In the fourth quarter our gross margin was 34.4%, an increase of 45 basis points from last year. Our gross margin expansion was due to the following factors: First, our U.S. business reported 33 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter due primarily to lower mark downs than last year. Our holiday category alone contributed 21 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter.  Second, we realized 12 basis points of margin expansion from our Canadian business as we didn\u2019t repeat certain promotions and we lapsed the disruption we experienced last year when we implemented [Score or SAP]. For the year, we experienced 22 basis points of gross margin expansion.  Turning to operating expenses for the quarter and the year it is easiest to compare our year-over-year performance by looking at adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales. When I say adjusted operating expenses we adjust expenses for strategic charges taken in 2008 and 2009. We detailed the financial impact of those charges in an exhibit to our press release which sets forth reported and adjusted results for both years.  So on an adjusted basis, for the fourth quarter operating expenses as a percent of sales were 29.4%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. We leveraged expenses primarily because of positive same store sales but we also saw continued benefits from the changes we have implemented to improve efficiency across our businesses.  On an adjusted basis for fiscal 2009 operating expenses as a percent of sales were 26.4%, an increase of 18 basis points from last year. For the year we de-leveraged expenses by about 3 basis points for every point of negative comp, considerably better than we had planned at the beginning of the year. Our income tax provision rate was 25.9% in the fourth quarter reflecting a $47 million benefit arising from global tax planning. Our effective tax rate was 34.2% for the year which includes both the fourth quarter tax benefit and a favorable foreign tax settlement we reported in the second quarter of 2009.  Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.18 for the fourth quarter excluding the HD write down adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.24 for the fourth quarter. For the year earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.55. On an adjusted basis earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66, down 6.7% from last year.  Moving to our operational metrics during the quarter we opened three new stores and closed one store for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the fourth quarter selling square footage was 235 million, a 1.3% decrease from last year. Reflecting the sales environment total sales per square foot for the fourth quarter were $245, up 1.7% from last year. For fiscal 2009 sales per square foot were $279.  Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the year retail inventory was $10.2 billion, down 4.5% from last year. On a per-store basis, inventory was down 3.3% to last year. Inventory turnover was 4.1 times, up 1/10 from last year. This was our first annual increase in annual inventory turnover since 2001, a true team effort and we view this as solid performance as our in stock positioning is at a record high level.  We ended the quarter with $41 billion in assets including $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $900 million in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2008 reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $5.4 billion offset by $1.8 billion used to repay senior notes that came due in September and December, $1.5 billion of dividends paid, $966 million of capital expenditures and $213 million of share repurchases.  In the fourth quarter we used excess cash to repurchase $115 million or 4.1 million shares of outstanding stock. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 10.7%. On an adjusted basis, return on invested capital was 11.1%, 70 basis points higher than what we reported for the third quarter of fiscal 2009.  As Frank mentioned, we performed well against our internal expectations in 2009. As we look to 2010 we expect our performance to improve as macroeconomic conditions improve. We have detailed our guidance in our press release so let me just hit the high points.  First, let me remind you we guide off of GAAP. We base our working estimates on a number of external factors and we are not expecting a robust recovery. For the year, we project our sales will increase by approximately 2.5% driven primarily by positive same-store sales. We plan to open just six stores in 2010. We expect sales growth to be flattish in the first half and stronger in the second half of the year in line with economic forecasts.  We are pleased with how we started off 2010. Even with the extra winter storms, February sales are trending to our plan. For fiscal 2010 we expect earnings per share from continuing operations to increase by approximately 15% to $1.79. Included in our earnings per share guidance is modest gross margin expansion and expense leverage. We continue to learn more about the fixed, variable nature of our expenses. For fiscal 2010 you should expect expenses to grow at approximately 60% of our sales growth rate and here we are talking about adjusted expenses. Finally, we have not included the impact of share repurchases in our earnings per share guidance. We will touch on share repurchases in just a moment.  For fiscal 2010 we project cash flow from the business of roughly $5.4 billion. This forecast assumes we refinance $1 billion of senior notes that come due in August of 2010. We will use our cash to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. Our capital spending plan for 2010 is $1.250 billion, reflecting $180 million for new stores, $635 million for our existing U.S. stores and supply chain, $350 million for IT and $85 million for our non-U.S. businesses.  We just announced a 5% increase in our dividend and will use our cash to fund our dividend which for the year approximates $1.6 billion. We have $12.5 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. It is our intent to use excess cash to repurchase shares over the course of the year. Depending on the timing of our repurchases we should see some earnings per share benefit arising from this activity in 2010. The debt finance portion of our repurchase program remains on hold principally because we are early in our recover. As our business gains momentum we will revisit the debt finance portion of our share repurchase program.  Thank you very much for your participation in today\u2019s call. We are now ready for questions. \nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein: I wanted to focus on expenses here. Obviously a very strong performance throughout the year and another good performance in Q4. It is helpful to think about expense dollar growth at 60% of sales growth so that kind of implies 1.5% dollar growth for the coming year. My question is, can you do better than that if the comp comes in flat? Obviously the performance over the past year has been far better than that. Would you think from here on out you would need a 1.5 comp to lever expenses given that embedded dollar growth? A little bit more color on what might drive you to exceed those expectations again given the strong performance you have already had and the expense reductions that have already been made. \nCarol Tome :  First, thank you regarding your comments on our expenses. We have taken out over $1.3 billion of costs over the past two years. Thank you for that. As we look forward to 2010 there are a couple of things you need to think about as you think about expenses. First, as you know payroll is our biggest expense and we do have an activity based model. As we build out our sales force plan we assume early on in the year more of the sales growth will come from transactions than ticket and then as the year progresses we see more of the sales growth coming from ticket. Transactions drive payroll in the store as you can appreciate.  So clearly depending upon the composition of the sales growth we have some opportunities to leverage payroll. We do have some expense pressure coming at us in 2010 that we didn\u2019t have in 2009. For example, our medical costs are increasing by about 9% in 2010. We will do everything we can do to mitigate that pressure but we plan for that because we think that is what it may be. We have some other cost pressures coming at us. States are hungry for money. We know they are coming at us for more property taxes. We have some computer maintenance costs coming at us because of all of the IT investments we have made. So we have factored all those cost pressures coming in.  We can be pretty nimble on the expense structure as you have seen us. We will always strive to do better but we are giving you our best estimate of costs for 2010. One last comment, and I know I am going on and on, but one last comment one expenses is that if sales growth is better than the guidance that we have given you we should do better on the leverage. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein:  You said you gained market share in 6 of 13. Again implying you lost in 7 of 13. Yesterday Lowes said they gained 10 of 20 implying they lost in 10 of 20. Who is gaining share if the two of you are losing more share than you are gaining on a category level? \nCraig Menear :  It really varies based on the category itself. It could be independents. It could be other home center type operations. It could be a multitude of different retailers. So it really varies by category.   \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citi: I wanted to focus on the gross margin side. Carol can you maybe dive into some of the guidance for 2010? I think your guidance was for modest extension. Does that have to do with some of the pressures from fuel and also inflation? Also I would think there are some opportunities to do additional private label and exclusive opportunities but maybe if you just flesh through some of that for us? \nCarol Tome :  If you think about just the operating margin we have guided to for 2010, 8% operating margin is about a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year if you look at our adjusted operating margin for 2009. Of that 50 basis point improvement year-over-year about 20 basis points will come from our gross margin expansion and about 30 basis points from expense leverage, more or less. As you think about the gross margin expansion it is really coming from our focused portfolio approach and all the efforts that Craig and the merchants and the logistics teams are doing to drive out costs. We are getting smarter about our approach to merchandising. It is driving the margin expansion and we are pleased with the expansion that we have [incurred] over the past couple of years.  This is in line with our path to continue to reach our long-term operating margin target of 10%. We feel real good about that. Craig I don\u2019t know if you want to give any color? \nCraig Menear :  I think you are right. It really is the continued implementation of our portfolio strategy, working to build better line structures, leveraging the opportunity we have with the supply chain transformation and the utilization of new tools that allows us to do a better job of forecasting and putting the right inventory in the right place. Therefore we are not spending unnecessary mark downs to liquidate product and we are doing a better job particularly on the seasonal side to make sure the product is in the right place and that drives efficiency for gross margin. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citi: I think you said at the analyst meeting that the tools were about 25% rolled out. On the call you said about 1/3 of the way rolled out. In that timeframe what are the changes that have been implemented and would the [inaudible] be in that timeframe? \nCraig Menear :  Again, it is the continued on-boarding if you will of our categories to our assortment maintenance tool which allows us to assort below market level in a much easier way. It is the continued development in terms of understanding how to use the tools that we have and continue to get better at our forecasting with the new tools. So as we go along while we are about 1/3 of the way we continue to learn each year. Our seasonal businesses, for example, have now been through four planning cycles and we have learned each year how to improve upon that. Our holiday d\u00e9cor performance this year was a great example of that. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citi: Can you talk about the size of the online business and the opportunity there? \nCraig Menear :  The online business as we look forward is an important business overall. It is still small in the scope of Home Depot in total but it is an important element for us to continue to develop and integrate with our orange box business. \nCarol Tome :  We look forward to the day when it is sizeable and we can talk about it. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Jaison Blair \u2013 Rochdale Securities. \nJaison Blair \u2013 Rochdale Securities: As you said conventional wisdom is that we are not going to experience a robust recovery and the U.S. industry in general has been focused on learn inventories and cost structures. However it seems we are starting to see signs of life on bigger ticket and potentially unwinding of pent up demand across the economy. How do you make sure you balance lean inventories with the very low operating rates of manufacturers and the challenges they may face meeting a surge of demand? Does it make sense to begin to start to take up your assumptions when you are planning your inventories and can you bake those lead times into those assumptions? \nFrank Blake :  I think that is a great point and something that Craig and his merchants spend a lot of time working with our vendors on to make sure they understand what our projections are and that they are facilitized to meet those projections. Craig, do you want to comment on it? \nCraig Menear :  The only thing I would add to that is the fact there is a lot of capacity there in our supply base and they are just looking to have the opportunity to drive the utilization of that capacity up. As Frank said, collaborative planning, strong communication is the key to making sure we are able to take care of an upswing. \nJason Blair \u2013 Rockdale : Doesn\u2019t it take some time to ramp up that capacity? If the entire supply chain decides to restock at the same time there are risks that you miss the boat? \nCraig Menear :  First of all the ramp up in most categories isn\u2019t all that significant. Then again you have to remember that we are sitting with a good inventory position today so you are really talking about ramping up the incremental. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus. \nDavid Schick - Stifel Nicolaus: You talked about bigger ticket demand and appearing to be improving and your competitors did as well. You are without Expo for the first time in over a decade. Do you plan to bring any different approach to an installed business or your attempts there? Any Expo practices into the orange box? \nCraig Menear :  I think as we again work to implement our portfolio strategy we are continually looking for opportunity to drive line structure improvements. When you look at the percent of business in any given category that is done between OPP, mid price point and upper price point as you see growth within that category it is the merchant\u2019s job to continue to try and push that curve and see if you can move up in the structure.  We have seen some success in certain categories. Probably the most common example of that is our Behr Ultra which is at the upper end of our paint product offering and just doing a phenomenal job with the customer because it delivers great value for what it actually does for the customer. So it is something we are monitoring and watching and we will move as the market warrants the movement. \nDavid Schick - Stifel Nicolaus: So no explicit plans to go [up] market but watching it real time? \nCraig Menear :  Correct. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Alan Rifkin - Bank of America. \nAlan Rifkin - Bank of America: If the housing market hopefully continues its recovery throughout 2010 how are you going to balance the additional cost of potentially hiring associates to meet those increases in volumes? In other words, will you need to see an increase in your comps and revenues first or will you proactively add associates on the floor as your outlook for the housing environment changes throughout 2010? \nFrank Blake :  As Carol described we have an activity based labor model and as our projection calls for more transactions we add the labor in anticipation. So Marvin Ellison is here. Do you want to comment on that as well? \nMarvin Ellison :  The one thing we talked about when we got together at the analyst conference is we are trying to shift payroll from what we call task, or non-customer facing locations to customer service locations. Just in the fourth quarter we were able to take almost 70 hours of payroll back office type positions to the sales floor. So incrementally we added no hours but to the customer service part of the business it felt like we added almost two full time associates because we took them from the back room to the sales floor.  So not only are we going ramp up staffing based on our sales projections, we are going to continue on our mission to eliminate as much task, auditing and process we can ship to an automated process while leveraging Matt [Carey\u2019s] team\u2019s innovations and put associates on the sales force so we can kind of kill two birds with one stone. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Gary Balter - Credit Suisse. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: You had a really strong performance and that was with the investment in the distribution centers which at the meeting you had in Georgia you talked about would continue into this year. Can you somehow quantify the costs embedded in the 2009 and 2010 guidance and then as we look out to 2011 the benefits we could see from that? \nCarol Tome :  We have really never broken out the cost of the supply chain transformation because it is all part of what we are doing from a merchandising transformation perspective. We have given you long-term perspective on where our margin is going to go and we are well on the path to reach those long-term targets we have given. So as the facilities come online and start to pay for themselves we are adding more facilities obviously to build this out throughout 2010, which should be able to cover those costs effectively in 2010. The real margin opportunities are going to show for us in 2011 once it is up and running. It is not just the margins. While we have done a really nice job I think on inventory we have some inventory opportunities coming at us in 2011 too.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: So when you talked I think it was 20-40 basis points that Mark was highlighting we are not seeing that at this stage of the investment? \nCarol Tome :  We are not seeing that. That\u2019s right. We had some benefits from fuel and some other things you might see that are supply chain related but we are on path to deliver the long-term targets we gave. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: How much is lumber pricing impacting comps and what are your thoughts about lumber pricing going forward? \nCraig Menear :  If you look at lumber in the quarter certainly the lumber market did increase during the timeframe both on framing lumber and panel with significantly more driven on framing than in panel. But the total impact to our business in the quarter was six basis points. What you have to remember is right now the supply is offset by lack of demand if you will. So there is not a lot of demand out there obviously in the construction industry.  So what used to be a low teens penetration for us is around the 7% penetration today. It is really not a huge impact at this point certainly in the quarter and as we look forward we will continue to monitor it and watch. Today the rising cost really is due to smaller log decks that are out there because there is just not a ton of demand. There is wet forest in the south which makes it difficult to pull logs out and then you have pulp and paper mills competing with saw mills for what product is available. So that is kind of helping to drive the cost side of the market. We will see what happens on the demand side. \nCarol Tome :  I want to go back to your question because I want to make sure I give you as much color as possible. If you think about our overall gross margin expansion target it was 120 basis points and that included the 20-40 from the supply chain. So Craig and I have been talking about it and today we think we have enjoyed about 40 basis points. We have just guided another 20 basis points for 2010 so that gives us 60. So we should be half of the way through in 2010. Then supply chain comes online big time in 2011 and that is when you should see the rest between 2011 and whenever. But it is coming. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Co. \nLaura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Co.: I have another question on your gross margin. Is there any implication, a material positive implication, from product costs from ramping up your sourcing out of the RDCs?\nCraig Menear :  Not beyond the guidance we have given in terms of our total merchandising transformation and supply chain. Over a period of years we see 120 basis point expansion. Beyond that, no. \nLaura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Co.: As we go through this year and demand starts to improve what is your outlook for overall product costs? \nCarol Tome :  There is no pricing pressure out there. Inflation is very, very low. We aren\u2019t seeing any pricing pressure. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch \u2013 Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch \u2013 Raymond James: I would like to explore the pro business again. A couple of quarters ago you said that a recovery has to be based and have a significant impact on the pro. I think you told us at that point that using the company data it had gone from like 32% of sales to 27% of sales. I am curious if you have updated that? If you have gotten any color on the pro and are you seeing any competitive intrusion in the pro business? \nFrank Blake :  What the data would tell us is the pro business is still more down particularly compared to the consumer business but where the rate of decline had been in the 20+ range it is now more in the teens, mid to low teens. So it is still down. Definitely one of the things implied in our 2010 guidance is we see the pro business strengthening as we go through the year and being much stronger in the back half of the year. \nBudd Bugatch \u2013 Raymond James: Marvin talked about changing task hours for customer facing hours. Can you give us an average of where we are now in terms of payroll in the stores versus cash versus customer facing and where it might be at the end of next year? \nMarvin Ellison :  We are approximately at about 55% service to task. When we started this we were on the other side of that. We had probably 40% service and the majority in task. We have taken a lot of steps. One big move we made this past quarter we took our broad room or back office associate that balances the register tills and we worked with Matt [Carey\u2019s] team and automated that process. We were able to take almost 40 hours of payroll from a back office position and we put that payroll directly on the sales floor. We allow the stores to determine based on their department penetration of hardware, garden, paint, etc. where we put those payroll hours to drive sales.  That was a direct impact to the service levels in our stores and we started to see as we do these initiatives immediate responses from our customer service surveys. As you know we get over 100,000 customer service surveys each and every week. Our net promote scores as Frank mentioned is at a 700 basis point improvement from last year and these initiatives are a key contributor to that improvement. \nBudd Bugatch \u2013 Raymond James: Where do you think your goal is for next year? \nMarvin Ellison :  Our goal is to get to 60/40 and that is 60% service and 40% task. We are going to give a good shot to try and get there at the beginning of 2011 but there are a lot of factors that will contribute to that but that is the goal we are going after. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: First of all on the principle question you guided to 8% operating margin in 2010 which is certainly faster than we initially thought you would get there. Has your performance and both on a cyclical basis and also some of the initiatives you have put in place led you to reconsider the normalized targets you have discussed in the past? \nFrank Blake :  No. I would say we are still on those targets. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: You spoke about improvement in Florida and California with some scattered signs of positive comps. Can you talk about the pace of improvement you saw in those troubled markets relative to the pace of improvement you saw for the company overall? \nFrank Blake :  I would say if you again not putting only a few markets positive but if you would say kind of the pace maybe a little bit more of a pace of pickup in California and to some extent in some of the markets in Florida. That is obviously a positive for us. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Is there a lot of difference among markets in those regions? \nFrank Blake :  You are exactly right. There is a lot of difference. Northern California is different than Southern California. Orlando is different than Miami. Each of the markets is its own story. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict - Robert Baird. \nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird:  Carol did you give us what the U.S. store traffic did for the quarter year-over-year? U.S. comp stores? \nCarol Tome :  I can give you the U.S. comps if that is what you are looking for. \nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: I was more interested in U.S. comp store traffic or comp transactions. \nCarol Tome :  The comp tickets? \nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird:  Yes. \nCarol Tome :  The U.S. comp was 2.1%. The ticket was down 3.2%. \nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: With the better average ticket trend you are seeing how are you thinking about this spring\u2019s riding mower outlook? Any adjustments? \nCraig Menear :  No. I think we feel like we are well positioned for the spring business. I think the industry projections are again for 2010 to not be dramatically robust in that particular product category. It is still a big ticket transaction. So we are hopeful if you will but not looking for robust growth. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley. \nGregory Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley: When you mentioned the inventory was down I believe that was a global number, or the U.S.? If so, if you expect comps to pick up this year why would the inventory be down? \nCarol Tome :  That is a total company number we shared with you. Part of the decline was Expo but only about $133 million was related to Expo. So we did rationalize inventory based on the sales environment. We will be building inventory in support of the sales guidance that we have given you. \nGregory Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley: So we should expect inventory to start to grow in the U.S. business similar to the comps you expect? \nCarol Tome :  About 50% of the growth rate. \nGregory Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley: In terms of credit, something that has helped you much of this year can you tell us what that helped in the fourth quarter if at all and what you are planning for 2010? \nCarol Tome :  When we sat here a year ago we told you we expected about $250 million of expense benefit in 2009 as a result of our renegotiated private label credit card agreement. We actually enjoyed about $300 million of expense benefit. So we did better. In the fourth quarter the year-over-year benefit was about $91 million and that included $21-22 million of an expense true-up we hadn\u2019t counted on. We were pleased obviously with the performance. Now as we look towards 2010 we are not going to repeat this. If you look at it, a simple way of thinking about it what will your cost of credit be next year? The cost of credit next year will be about 1.2%, in line with what it was in 2009. \nGregory Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley: So it starts to be flat and that is pretty much through the year? \nCarol Tome :  Yes. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies. \nDan Binder \u2013 Jefferies : Related to the question earlier about share gains, if you continue to take share in roughly half the categories, is that in your view sufficient enough to allow gross margins to keep rising? Or do you think once you get that level you have to rethink how much you reinvest in price? \nFrank Blake :  First off, let me just make a more global comment around share and share gains because we referenced two different things during the course of our discussion this morning. One is an entire U.S. market that is the NAICS I can\u2019t remember 444 and that looks at everybody in the lumber and building and garden center area. Then, there are discrete third-party surveys of share that tie to what Craig was referencing in terms of particular product categories. So we picked up 100 basis points of share overall as measured by the census bureau or whoever measures it. Then as Craig said on individual items we had six where we gained share.  In terms of your broader question, look our intent is to gain share in every category and then Craig and team, consistent with the overall portfolio approach, figures out how we go about doing that. So we are never happy if we show ourselves losing share anywhere. \nDan Binder \u2013 Jefferies : Related to store growth, it is pretty modest as expected for next year. I am curious if we get into a situation where comps start to get back into material positive territory, call it mid single digits or so, would you consider or rethink the store growth strategy for out years?  \nFrank Blake :  I think it is important to keep in mind for our business that we are significantly smaller at the end of 2009 than they were at the end of 2006. Our sales per square foot are significantly lower at the end of 2009 than they were at 2006. Even with a strong market recovery or a modest recovery or whatever the recovery is going to be we see an enormous opportunity in building up the productivity of the existing stores we have and getting back to the numbers we had in terms of sales per square foot several years ago.  There will always be geographic opportunities to add stores where growth is in a different area than it used to be or you have to reposition yourself but there is a lot of sales for us to absorb in our existing store base. \nCarol Tome :  We have such a disciplined approach to capital allocation. As we have talked to you about we want to show increasing rates of return on our return on invested capital, not decreasing rates of return. So if we see opportunities to increase the rate of return we will take those opportunities. We are not going to spend just to dilute the return. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Analyst for Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Assoc. \nAnalyst for Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Assoc. :  A couple of the categories you mentioned both in the kitchen and bath space and flooring, can you talk about what the promotional environment was like there? Are you still having to pull the consumer to the store or are you seeing confidence start to improve for those categories? \nCraig Menear :  Let me start with kitchen and bath. We are working hard to continue to drive that business and get to our everyday great value proposition for our customers. We are not there yet in that product category, nor is the industry. So that is an area we continue to see. Likewise appliances would be another category that still has promotional activity in it as well and that is going to be an industry that has done it that way for a long time. So it will be a category that will be a challenge for us to try and break that cycle but we certainly would like to get to everyday value for our customer.  In the flooring business it is different. We are pretty well there. On an everyday basis part of our heritage in our company is to go out and grab special buy opportunities our manufacturers might have to bring some urgency to the business. We do that in that industry but at the same time we are driving great value everyday for our customers and we see that pull through as a result. \nAnalyst for Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Assoc. : I know you have made foreclosures an initiative in some of the stores and some programs around the pro desk. Can you talk about any benefit you are seeing there and the programs you expect to have in place this year to benefit from what should be more foreclosure sales in the market? \nMarvin Ellison :  We started that focus in Northern California and we reaped some benefits by simply talking to our customers and as noted the Pro segment is under pressure so a lot of the pro contractors shifted their business focus to doing different types of projects and foreclosure properties became one of those. We have done a pretty extensive survey around the country identifying markets that fit a certain profile and we have implemented these initiatives in the stores around certain product categories we have brought in, around certain types of communication activities to these customers, as well as educating them on the features and benefits of our contractor/pro desk in our stores.  So we have expanded this to areas in Florida and in some areas in the Midwest and we are hoping to see similar benefits we have identified so far in the Northern California area. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser - Barclays Capital. \nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: With the home improvement market seeming to be reaching an inflection point and the company achieving so many improvements in customer service during the downturn, how are you thinking about the cost of drawing back customers that might have been alienated in the past? Might you have to use either promotions or advertising? Have you contemplated that in the long-term margin outlook? If it occurs more organically than perhaps you have assumed might that provide upside to the margin outlook? \nFrank Blake :  We have been on a path over the last several years trying to draw our customers back and providing great customer service in our stores. We have also taken a different tact on our marketing campaign. I think our marketing better reflects Home Depot and our values and what we bring to our customers. It is truly one customer at a time. I don\u2019t think there is any other way to do it. \nCarol Tome :  I wouldn\u2019t discount our social media. We have our own Facebook page. We tweet. We are talking to customers in ways that we have never talked to them before. \nMarvin Ellison :  We have also taken an unprecedented approach where we are also surfing all the social media sites and we are identifying customer issues before they even come to us. We are communicating and contacting customers and when we see or hear and see any negative chatter about the Home Depot or service experience and we are addressing those proactively.  As Frank mentioned in his opening statements we took the aggressive step last year to retrain every single associate in our store on our new customer service expectation by position. Our goal is simply this, and Craig and I have discussed this often, as the merchandising and marketing team draw customers to the stores it is our expectation in the store to convert those customers with improved service. That has been the goal and we have work to do but we think we have made some progress. \nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: On Canada, now that the tax credit has expired have you seen perhaps a drop off in demand that was consistent with your expectations? I know Carol you said that February has been running according to your planning assumptions. Is that true in Canada as well? \nFrank Blake :  It is consistent with our expectations. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Stephen Chick \u2013 FBR. \nStephen Chick - FBR: What interest expense number are you assuming within your guidance for 2010? I seem to recall you had guaranteed some debt on the part of Home Depot Supply. I just want to clarify if that is the case and the status of that given the equity write downs? \nCarol Tome :  Sure. We are estimating an interest expense of about $600 million next year. As it relates to the HD supply question we did guarantee $1 billion senior secured note that is an amortizing loan so the principle is something I think around $980 million right now. We have taken no action on the guarantee. It doesn\u2019t expire until 2012 and there is nothing that has come to our attention that suggests we should do anything differently.  Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. \nOperator:  That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Beginning today's discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you, Joseph and good morning to, everyone. Welcome to the Home Depot third quarter earnings conference call. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of the Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analysts' questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up, please. This conference call is being broadcast realtime on the Internet at homedepot.com, with links on both our home page and the Investor Relations section. The replay will also be available on our site. If you are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our investor relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you this today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided in the financial statements included with our earnings release. Now, let me turn the call over to Frank Blake. \nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $16.4 billion, down 8% from last year. Our comp sales were negative 6.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.41. As Carol will detail, our comp sales in the U.S. were negative 7.1%. From a regional perspective, our Gulf market had double-digit negative comps as we anniversaried the impact of last year's hurricanes. But as a sign of the steadying of our business at the end of the quarter, 36 of our top 40 markets showed a sequential comp improvement on a rolling six-week average basis. Our strongest regions were the mid-Atlantic and mid-South, but we also continue to see signs of stabilization in the markets that were hardest hit by the housing crisis, such as California, Florida and Arizona. We gained overall market share in the quarter. From a macro perspective, for the first time in the last few years, private fixed residential investment, PFRI, as a percent of GDP did not decline quarter-over-quarter. We've referenced the PFRI data point consistently and while it's not a perfect indicator of our business, it is at least directionally relevant. So, it's positive news that the PFRI data seemed to have bottomed. Despite this positive momentum, caution is appropriate. We are still in less bad territory for comps, not positive. Average ticket performance remains a concern, even as our comp transaction rate stabilizes. Our average ticket reflects not only pressure on high end discretionary items, but also pressure on our pro business. Data from the Home Improvement Research Institute confirm our own data that pro sales are under significantly more stress than DIY oriented sales. We have not yet seen sustained evidence of a recovery in the pro business. In this environment, we're focused on improving customer service and taking significant steps to improve our overall business. On the supply chain front, we now have 10 rapid deployment centers, RDCs, serving approximately 1,000 stores or more than 50% of our U.S. store base. We have opened our second mechanized facility in Redlands, California. We've talked a fair amount about our RDCs, but at the same time that our supply chain team is proceeding with the rollout of these new facilities, we're also restructuring another part of our supply chain, our stocking DCs. We have closed two stocking DCs so far in 2009 and in total, we'll reduce approximately 1.3 million square feet of stocking warehouse space by the end of the year, driving additional supply chain efficiency. Our merchandising and IT transformation remain on track. For example, Matt Carey and his team are well underway with the development of new forecasting tools to feed into our centralized automated replenishment system. Over 70% of our SKU's are on automated replenishment. We're pleased with our in-stock improvement to date, but our current forecasting system is too manual requiring frequent associate intervention, particularly, to deal with spike sales. When you think about the project and seasonal orientation of our business, that's a significant issue. The new system will use multiple forecasting algorithms to improve our ability to predict and handle these spike sale variations, returning hours to our associates for customer-facing activity and further improving our in-stock rates. You may have heard Matt, at our Annual Investor Conference, talking about moving the Home Depot into the 21st Century on our merchandising systems. This is just one part of that effort. Craig and his team are doing a great job bringing value and innovation to our customers and helping them find simple solutions to their project needs. Increasingly, simplification also leads to a better answer from an environmental perspective, whether it's paint and primer in one, recycling programs for holiday lights and power tools or water saving toilets. On the store operations side, our net promoter score, which takes the percent of our customers who rate their experience with us as a nine or better, and subtracts from that the percent of customers who rate their experience as six or worse, with 64.1% in October, over 8.5 percentage points higher than last year at this time. At the beginning of the year, we reorganized our service business under Marvin Ellison and his field team to give operational focus to that business. With that focus, they have improved our install satisfaction level to over 8.8 on a scale of one to 10, significantly above last year and have rolled out a version of customer-first training for our installers. This quarter, our installed sales comp outperformed our overall company comp. We've also taken significant steps to revamp our approach to associate learning. Tim Crow and the HR team, in conjunction with Marvin's team, have developed creative new techniques for improving our associate product knowledge. Road shows, where vendors and merchants travel to the field to give associates product and project training, have long been a hallmark of the Home Depot. But as our store base expanded, it became more and more difficult to use this vehicle for training and road shows became infrequent. But we've now implemented virtual road shows that take advantage of modern technology, while at the same time providing some of the excitement and immediacy of the prior format. On the international side of our business, Mexico continues to perform well with a positive comp for the quarter in a very tough economic environment. The Canadian business had flat comps, which represents a strong quarter-over-quarter improvement and we had mid single-digit negative comps in China. Overall, the economic environment remains difficult, but the dedication of our associates is making a difference, both in customer service and in the underlying improvements in the business. I want to thank them for all their hard work. With that, let me turn the call over to Craig. \nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank and good morning, everyone. We're starting to see early signs of stabilization in our business. We performed well in the quarter despite lapping hurricanes and for the second consecutive quarter, we posted a positive comp in paint. The departments that outperformed the company average comp in the quarter were paint, plumbing, flooring, garden, kitchen and bath, and building materials. Lumber, hardware, electrical and millwork underperformed the company average comp for the quarter. In general, we continue to see strength in DIY repair and simple remodel projects. Energy efficiency also remains an area of relative strength, as customers look for ways to save money on ENERGY STAR products like appliances and water heaters. On the other hand, typical pro and construction categories including plywood, dimensional lumber, concrete and gypsum, performed below the company average comp. The pressure on big ticket projects continues to impact our total average ticket. Our average ticket for the third quarter was $51.89, down 7.1% from last year, but the rate of decline was slightly better than previous quarter. On a comp basis, our average ticket declined by 6.4%. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, which represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down about 10% in the quarter, a lesser rate of decline than previous quarters. This improvement was due, in part, to appliances, which performed better than the company average comp. Our really free delivery program is just one example of how we're offering our customers great value and a simplified shopping experience, while driving improved results. Transactions for tickets of $50 and below, also roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., were positive 2%. We also saw continued stabilization in total customer transactions, which were $314 million in the third quarter, basically flat to last year. Our operational initiatives around customer service, coupled with our strong value message, are helping to bring customers into our store. In the quarter, we experienced commodity deflation in lumber and copper. This deflation negligibly impacted U.S. comp sales by approximately 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively. However, as we exited the third quarter, these commodities were approaching prior year cost levels. As I mentioned earlier, basic repair and maintenance categories performed well. For example, roofing, caulk, plumbing repair and chemicals all posted positive comps in the quarter. Additionally, categories that would be considered simple d\u00e9cor updates such as paint, vinyl flooring and special order carpet, also posted positive comps. Over the past year, we've further implemented our portfolio strategy, resulting in strategic category investments. We review about 30% of our products each year updating our assortments and presentations. Some of the recent assortment resets include light bulbs, paint applicators and ceramic tile, all of which performed above the company average comp in the quarter. As a result of these investments, our total U.S. market share has grown 95 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis. In the quarter, we gained consumer unit share in five of our 13 departments as reported by an independent third-party. We continue to learn and leverage from our merchandising tools allowing us to improve efficiency and drive more value from our customers. With the tools, we better understand the cost components of our purchases and with that knowledge, we are better able to manage the productivity of our cost of goods sold. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we're excited to offer our customers value, innovation and exclusive products for their homes. Studies show that approximately 60% of U.S. homes are under-insulated in the attic. In response, Home Depot has lowered the retail price on insulation to help our customers save money and improve energy-efficiency of their home. Additionally, we're excited to become the exclusive big box retailer for the number one insulation brand, Owens Corning. Also in fourth quarter, we're looking forward to our initial launch of outdoor living and storage product lines through our exclusive partnership with Martha Stewart. We believe this is an opportunity to gain larger share of wallet of our customers by partnering with Martha, an authority on design and home improvement. A key priority for us, as merchants, is to be the customer's advocate for value. In the third quarter of last year, we launched our new lower price campaign to highlight our every day value message. Over the past 12 months, we have lowered prices on hundreds of products, saving our customers over $0.5 billion. Our team will continue to focus on simplifying the shopping experience and offering innovative products at great value that save our customers' time and money. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Craig and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $16.4 billion, an 8% decrease from last year, reflecting negative comp or same-store sales of 6.9% and the net impact of fewer stores, due primarily to the closing of our EXPO businesses. Net earnings were $689 million, compared to $756 million last year. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.41 versus $0.45 last year. We reported negative comps of 9.6% in August, negative 7.2% in September and negative 4.3% in October. Comps for our U.S. stores were negative 7.1% for the quarter. Given that we had no hurricane-related sales in 2009 compared to approximately $125 million of hurricane-related sales in the third quarter of last year, we were pleased with our comp result. Our U.S. comps were negative 9.3% in August, negative 7% in September, and negative 5.2% in October. The sales impact of currency fluctuations moderated in the third quarter. Fluctuating exchange rates negatively impacted sales by $94 million in the third quarter, as compared to $750 million for the first nine months of the year. Our gross margin was 34% in the third quarter, an increase of 29 basis points from last year. Our gross margin expansion reflects the impact of our portfolio strategy and was driven by the following factors. First, higher sales in certain categories drove us to higher purchasing tiers and allowed us to earn more co-op and rebate dollars in last year; second, we experienced a lower penetration of certain lower margin categories; and third, we experienced positive shrink performance in the quarter. Operating expenses, as a percent of sales, were 26.3%, flat to last year. As expected, we deleveraged payroll in the third quarter but that was offset somewhat by a lower cost of private label credit. Further, the changes we've implemented, to improve spending efficiency across our business, continued to gain traction. Our total expenses were $74 million under our plan in the third quarter. Costs out is one of our strategic imperative and we've made great progress in this area during 2009. On a year-to-date basis, we've delevered expenses by about three basis points for every point of negative comp. That's considerably better than our general rule of thumb of 10 basis points of deleverage for every point of negative comp. As we look to the fourth quarter, we will show considerably more expense deleverage than we have in the previous three quarters due to harder year-over-year comparisons. Operating margin was 7.7% in the third quarter, up 28 basis points from last year. In the third quarter, our income tax provision rate was 37.3%. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. Now, moving to our operational metrics, during the third quarter, we opened two new stores for an ending store count of 2,242. At the end of the third quarter, selling square footage was 235 million, down 1.3% from last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the third quarter were $276, down roughly 6.6%. Now, turning to the balance sheet, inventory remains a good news story. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $10.8 billion, down approximately $1.1 billion or 8.9% from last year. On a per store basis, inventory was down 7.8%. Inventory turns were 4.2 times, flat to last year. We ended the quarter with $43.1 billion in assets, including $2.7 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, from the end of fiscal 2008, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $5 billion, offset by $568 million of capital expenditures, $1.1 billion of dividends paid, $98 million of share repurchases and $1 billion used to repay senior notes that came due in September. In the quarter, we used excess cash to repurchase shares. We have $12.6 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We will continue to use excess cash to repurchase shares, but the debt finance portion of our share repurchase program remains on hold. To determine how much debt will remain in our capital structure, we look to our ratio of adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR. Our target adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio is 2.5 times and we expect to be near that target by the end of fiscal 2009. At the end of the third quarter, the ratio stood at 2.3 times. As a reminder, we have a $3.25 billion A2/P2 commercial paper program that is 100% back stopped by a committed bank line of credit. As of the end of the third quarter, we had no outstanding commercial paper. We have approximately $10.4 billion of outstanding debt, of which $750 million comes due in the fourth quarter of 2009. It is our intent to repay this debt maturity, as it comes due, using the cash we have. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was approximately 9.5%. On an adjusted basis, excluding charges related to our 2008 store rationalization actions and the closing of our EXPO businesses, return on invested capital was 10.4%. We are executing well in a tough environment. We continue to focus on our strategic imperative and our financial results reflect the progress we're making. Based on our results for the first nine months of the year and our forecast for the fourth quarter, we continue to believe sales will be down roughly 9% for the year. On the earnings front, we are projecting diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately $0.13 for the fourth quarter and for the year, on a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately $1.50, up 9.5% from last year. On an adjusted basis, we are projecting diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.55 for the year, a decline from fiscal 2008 of approximately 13%. In each case, our earnings per share guidance includes $0.03 of earnings per share benefit, resulting from a favorite foreign tax settlement we reported in the second quarter. We will share our 2010 guidance with you during our fourth quarter earnings conference call, which is scheduled for February 23rd. So, thank you for your participation in today's call. Joseph, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question from Peter Benedict of Robert Baird. \nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: Just wanted to get a sense, maybe Carol, of the traffic patterns in the U.S. stores during the third quarter. How was that number? I think it was up for the first time in awhile in the second quarter. Was it up again, and if not, was that impacted by the absence of the hurricane activity? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, we were very pleased with the comp transactions in our U.S. stores in the third quarter. They were basically flat year-over-year and that's particularly notable, given that we have 26 fewer stores than we had one year ago. \nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: Could you just take us through the decision to resume to buybacks in the third quarter? It sounds like you did a little over $100 million. What kind of got you guys to decide to go forward with it this quarter? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, we are a company that is a cash cow and the last thing we want to do is leave cash in a bank earning less than 1%. We've said all along that we will use our excess cash to repurchase shares. We were feeling pretty good about our liquidity. We have a trading window that opened up at the end of our second quarter earnings and we bought back some shares. Then, the trading windows closed and we stopped buying back shares. As we look forward, if we have excess cash, we will use it to repurchase shares. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the debt finance portion of our buyback is on hold because we use our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio as the governor for how much debt we will have in our capital structure. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. \nChris Horvers - JPMorgan: Can you talk about, I guess, some specifics around California and Florida? How they did versus the total company and what kind of sequential change was there? Also, on gross margin, can you share with us how you're thinking about the fourth quarter, given that you've seen such a nice lift here in the gross margin because of the merchandising tools year-to-date? Is that a contribution or a trend that should begin to moderate or do we have a lot of legs there? \nFrank Blake: So, Chris, first on California and Florida, one of the things to note there is there are actually a lot of different markets within those states and you see different patterns within the different cities. So, for example, in California, I see relatively more stability in, say, the San Diego area than in the Los Angeles area. The way we kind of look at it is we see markets that we think have fundamentally bottomed, markets that we think have a few more quarters to go until they bottom and then, markets that we're still a little uncertain about. Overall, I would say that the markets in California and Florida performed better in Q3 than they had previously. But whether they're above or below the company average, depends a little bit, again, on the city by city analysis. On the gross margin rate we see a slight improvement there. Maybe, Craig, you want to address that for the fourth quarter. \nCraig Menear: Yeah, I mean we're looking for some modest expansion in the fourth quarter. We're up against pretty strong performance from a year ago. But we do believe, that at this point, that we'll see some modest expansion. \nChris Horvers - JPMorgan: If I could just squeak one more in here, your fourth quarter comp outlook, given that you've guided to total sales, you can get a wide range in terms of comp expectation. Is there a number that we should be focused on there? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: The fourth quarter comp, we project, will be better than the third quarter comp and you can use a mid single-digit number. When we guide total sales down approximately 9% for the year, it's an approximate. That could be 8.7% or something like that. \nOperator: David Schick from Stifel Nicolaus has our next question. \nDavid Schick - Stifel Nicolaus: You talked about big ticket pressure and should we expect to see either merchandising changes or associate labors, staffing, how you are addressing that as 2010 plays out? How are you thinking about positioning around that or do you think it'll change quickly and no changes are needed? \nFrank Blake: Well, first, I don't expect quick changes. I think we'd like to see sequential improvement. As I said in my comments, it's important as you think about big tickets to think not only high-end discretionary items but also our pro business. For sure, one of the things that we've seen is the pro business tail off a little bit more, which makes some sense when you think about the overall credit issues in the country. One of the key questions in 2010 is going to be, how and what's the pace of that business starting to pick back up? But you wouldn't see us do anything dramatically different in terms of the labor in our stores. \nOperator: Moving on to of Gary Balter of Credit Suisse. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Just one question and one follow-up. Could you kind of define out your share buyback strategies? Because you're going generate over $4 billion of free cash flow next year. What should we be looking at for parameters in terms of debt-to-equity, et cetera? Obviously, you have to pay off some of the debt that you have. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Right. Well, let's start with the debt or the leverage question, Gary. We use adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR as the governor for how much debt we will have in our capital structure. After we pay back the $750 million of maturities that come due in December, we estimate that at year end we'll be close to that 2.5 metric. Clearly, as the earnings start to return to positive, we'll have increasing room to add leverage into our capital structure. So, if you think about next year, for example, we have $1 billion that comes due in August. It's our intent, at this time, to refinance that maturity. So then, we are faced with, as you point out, a lot of cash, cash that's being generated from our business. It is our view, as we look to returning capital to our shareholders, that we must look at both share repurchases and dividends. We are working on an articulated strategy, as it relates to both, which we will be happy to share with you when we give you our 2010 guidance in February. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Then just to follow-up. Last year, it was fourth quarter, where you really started doing a superb great job on expense reductions and that's probably what's behind the earnings for this year. But how should we think about expense savings going forward? Have we seen the bulk of it or is there still opportunity? \nFrank Blake: Well, Gary, there is still opportunity and obviously, a lot of the things that we're doing, in terms of investments in our supply chain and our merchandising and IT tools, have benefits also on the expense structure within the business. I mean I referenced just very briefly the consolidation of our stocking DC's. That has an interesting IT component to it because previously, we actually had separate systems and were not able to have that kind of consolidation. So, as we have developed improved IT tools, that allows us to get more efficiency on the operational side. I think we continue to have opportunities on that going forward. \nOperator: Now, we'll move on to a question from Michael Lasser of Barclays Capital. \nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: I'm curious if you have a sense of the spending break down by socioeconomic income demographic, such there might be a discernible pattern in the stores, depending on the medium home value in the surrounding areas? Frank, you mentioned that certain areas of California are doing better than others. So it seems that middle and lower income consumers are still feeling a considerable amount of stress, but the upper tier is feeling better. So, have you been able to recognize any pattern from that perspective? \nFrank Blake: Yeah, Michael, it's a great question. We actually look for those patterns. We look for what's the spend in the metropolitan area? What are the demographics? What are the unemployment rates? It's hard to tease out really strong correlations there. Intuitively, you'd think some of the markets, for example, in the Midwest that have been very hard hit, from an unemployment perspective, would be doing quite poorly. Yet, we see a pretty good performance from our stores there. So, there isn't any kind of broad statement that we can make that works. \nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: What about just in the weakest housing market states, is there even a subtle pattern? \nFrank Blake: Well, again, to the extent there is a pattern and we talked about this a little before, was in areas where we saw accelerating rates of foreclosure. That put some pressure on performance. That measure still kind of holds but it's more 50/50 now. We see some areas that have accelerating rates that are actually, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, doing a little better. \nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: One quick follow up. Carol, you've noted that overall buyer markdowns, in the past, have been about 2%, but in the lowest volume stores, the markdowns are closer to 7%. I was curious, you didn't necessarily call that out or improvement in that metric as a driver of the gross margin gains for the quarter. So are you seeing any convergence there? If you are, are you reinvesting any of that in the lower prices, like Craig talked about passing along savings of about $0.5 billion? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, our overall gross margin performance is a direct reflection of the portfolio strategy that our merchants are running. With the portfolio strategy, we are optimizing markdowns across our retail store base. We are then able to reinvest. Craig talked about our new lower price campaign, where we've saved over $0.5 billion in retail prices for our customers. So the portfolio strategy is working. We can optimize the value that we offer for our customers and create value. \nOperator: Colin McGranahan of Sanford Bernstein has our next question. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein: I wanted to focus back on expenses. A fairly impressive performance now, three years in the negative comps, to be able reduce expense dollars year-over-year by about 8.5%. Can you give us a little bit more color on how much of that was impacted by the private label credit? What were some of the other specific drivers of with it's a pretty big dollar reduction in expense dollars? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: We worked really hard on driving efficiencies across our business. In the third quarter, we deleveraged payroll by 46 basis points. The benefit of the private-label credit card negotiation offset that by 28 basis points. So we had about a $50 million year-over-year benefit. Across the rest of the expense structure, we just saw cost out everywhere we looked. So you can't point to one item, it's everywhere, from occupancy to our administrative overhead costs to depreciation. We're just driving benefits across the board. As Frank pointed out, as we bring our new tools online, we think we have more opportunities ahead. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein: The fourth quarter of last year is a little squishy because it was 52-week against a 53-week. Can you help us understand and remind us what the dollar expense reduction was, adjusted for that extra week in the fourth quarter last year? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, probably the best way to do that is to look at expenses on a per-store basis. If that's helpful. If I look at Q4 of 2007, expenses per store, and this is all adjusted, basically $2 million in 2008, $1.9 million. So, that gives you an idea. We're about $1.9 million right now. If I just could take a moment to talk about our fourth quarter guidance, this might be helpful. As we told you, we expect to delever expenses by about 10 basis points for every point of negative comp. Year-to-date, we're much better than that. We're at three basis points for every point of negative comp. For the year, we're going to do better than our 10 basis point rule, we are. But in the fourth quarter, we're forecasting that our expense deleverage will be about 20 basis points per point of negative comp and you may say, \"Well, why is that?\" Well, there are a couple of things you need to keep in mind. At the beginning of the year, we told you we thought our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations would be down about 26%. We're now telling you that they will be down 13%. We're outperforming and because we're outperforming relative to our plan, we're going to pay higher bonuses than we did last year. If you look success sharing alone, right now, 80% of our stores are in success sharing. A year ago, only 60% were in success sharing. So we've got more bonuses. We also see that we have expense pressure coming from medical that we didn't have in fourth quarter of last year. I don't think we're alone in this. I think a lot of companies are facing a higher medical costs, but we certainly are. A couple of other things that are driving the year-over-year comparisons: Last year, as you'll recall, we reduced our support staff by over 2,000 people. As a result of that, we had some forfeitures in our stock option expense. We won't repeat that this year. So, that's another year-over-year comparison Then, the benefit from credit should diminish. So when we add it up all, fourth quarter is going to look a little odd, but for the year, we're going to do better than our rule of thumb. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Chick, FBR. \nStephen Chick - FBR: I guess, Carol, that the items you've just quantified, it's a lot of separate little items that are going to impact the quarter versus, I guess, the sequential trend. Is there a number or a figure you can assign to all that combined or the success sharing piece, the bonus accrual piece, I mean is there some type of dollar figure we could have that might help us from a modeling perspective? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, what I'd like you to use is 20 basis points of deleverage for every point of negative comp. So based on your comp assumption for the fourth quarter, you can figure out what the deleverage will be. \nStephen Chick - FBR: That helps. So related to your comp guidance then, I think you're saying a mid single-digit decline, I think, is what you're implying for the fourth quarter. Call it negative six and it seems like, I don't know, if that's total company but I'm kind of thinking that the foreign currency piece might actually, maybe work in your favor for the fourth quarter, just on the math. What do you guys think in your U.S. comp, it is within that guidance? Then, it would be helpful, maybe, if you could tell us where you've started the quarter trend so far? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, it's very hard to predict what will happen with currency (inaudible). If you look at the behavior of our dollar, it's all over the place. So for the company, we're projecting a mid single-digit negative for the fourth quarter. As it relates to our performance, quarter to date in November, we're trending right along our expectations. \nStephen Chick - FBR: So you've slipped from in November versus where October was. Is that fair to say? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: I don't want you to leave with that impression. As we built our comp plan, we built a comp plan that suggested November would be stronger than October. It's trending along our expectations. Remember, this is a very seasonal business. For the quarter, we expect it to be a mid single-digit negative. \nStephen Chick - FBR: So it sounds a little conservative, Carol, just because of the comparison is pretty easy here in the fourth quarter versus what happened last year. \nFrank Blake: Steve, we obviously have that comparison in mind when we do the plan as well. \nStephen Chick - FBR: No, it's fair. It's just a pretty good deceleration in your two and three-year stack trends, as I look at it. Secondly, if I could, Carol, the U.S. comp store sale number for the quarter, you've been giving it more definitively in the last couple of quarters, whereas a year ago, you didn't. So, I'm wondering, actually, if you have what the U.S. store comp was for Q2 '08 and Q3 '08? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, [to be honest], I don't have that with me, but Diane will call you.\nDiane Dayhoff: I can get you that, Steve. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: I don't have it. I'm sorry. \nOperator: We'll now move to Deborah Weinswig of Citi. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citi: Craig, you had mentioned some details around the further implementation of your portfolio strategy. Can you please update us on some of the merchandising tools and more specifically, when will you expect them to be fully rolled out? As the assortment management tool, at this point in the game, the one that is the most developed? \nCraig Menear: Yeah, Deb, I think it's fair to say that the assortment management tool and some of the forecasting tools that we have are probably the most developed. Our seasonal businesses have now been on them for, this is the third planning cycle that we've done. In total, we're about 25 percent-ish of the way there. We continue to learn with the tools. We continue to be able to extract additional benefit as we go through each planning cycle and get better at using the tools. But I think it's fair to say that the two that you called out, the assortment management tool along with the forecasting, at this point, are most advanced use and benefit. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citi: Obviously, there was very impressive inventory performance in the quarter. How much of an impact was it from the tools and how much of it was other processes and as a result of the impressive inventory performance? Obviously, we've seen impressive shrink, but what other impacts has it had in the organization? \nCraig Menear: Well, the combination of the tools and if you'll recall, we've talked about in past about as we kind of go through our merchandising transformation, we're actually redoing all those processes in terms of how we actually run the business and then build the tools to support the new method to run the business. So it's a combination of the process and the support of the tools that's giving us greater visibility into the business and giving us a more granular focus when it comes to forecasting which has allowed us to have a better overall inventory performance. Couple that with better linkage into Marvin and his team in the field and I should say, obviously, back into the supply chain as well, we're seeing the kind of benefit in inventory performance there that you've noted. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Our customers are happy. Marvin, you should talk about them. \nMarvin Ellison: Yeah, Deb, this is, Marvin. I think one real point that you can note. Just go to any store and look in the overheads, I think you'll see lesser inventory in the overheads than you've ever, historically, seen in the Home Depot. The visibility Craig mentioned is important to the store's associate because our customers want to be able to come in and get the product from the shelf. In that past, we've had the product in the building but not on the shelf. Visibility is important. Associates can get the products out of the overhead, on the shelf. We can reduce $1 billion of inventory and still have our best in-stock percent we've had in years. Again, that's alignment between the merchants, the tools, the supply chain and the operators in the stores. We're pleased with it. We can get better and these tools will allow us to get better but again, we're building from a real solid platform today. \nCraig Menear: Marvin said something really important and that is, as part of our process, we never look at inventory without looking at in-stock at the same time. So, those have to go hand-in-hand. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citi: Then, just one follow up, thinking back to the tools, how should we think about holiday 2009 versus 2008? As the tools have been more developed, what should we see differently this year? \nFrank Blake: Well, I think we've utilized the tools to better mix the assortment in the right locations, depending on where you're at in the country and we've clustered stores. Right now, I would tell you that we're very pleased with how this season has started.\nOperator: Alan Rifkin of Bank of America has our next question. \nAlan Rifkin - Bank of America: Carol, you mentioned that total expenses were $74 million under your plan. Can you maybe provide some color as to where those expense savings came from and also comment on the sustainability of those savings going forward? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Most of the expenses are sustained cost out. There were some timing, I must say. For example, advertising was $3 million under plan. We'll spend that in the fourth quarter. So, there was some timing but most of it is sustained out and includes just running the business better. For example, if you think about, we have a broad based expense category called operations. Under that category are numerous lines. These would be lines that would include the costs of shopping bags in our store, the cost of delivery and on and on and on. Well, because we've implemented a new P&L checkbook for our stores, we saw that the operations expense line was $28 million under our plan, can't call out one big driver of that. It's just the stores working together with the finance teams and just doing a really good job of optimizing our costs. I could go on and on, Alan, but I feel pretty good about the controls that we're driving. \nMarvin Ellison: Alan, this is Marvin. Let me give you a perspective. Last year, a store would get a P&L at the end of the month, basically the middle of the month and they would then find out what they had spent. This online checkbook gives them realtime visibility, just like a normal account, so they know as they spend where they are versus their budget. It's a huge difference with 2,000 stores. That's why this whole operational budget Carol talked about, a lot of small things, when you add those small things up in 2,000 stores with better visibility, it just creates better discipline. We're pleased, but again, we can get better. With more tools and better visibility, our associates are proving that we can just run a very efficient business. \nAlan Rifkin - Bank of America: I do have a follow-up for Frank. Frank, it was mentioned a couple of times in the call that the excess cash, going forward, will be used to buy back stock. As we move into 2010 and as your CapEx is down 60% year-to-date and probably down in 2010 versus '09 and as your cash flows continued to significantly ramp up, irrespective of what the base business does. If there is a scenario in which the core business is still a little bit challenged in the first half of 2010, yet your excess cash in the first half of year continues to increase, your projected cash flows continue to increase as well, I mean could we see at that point in time a payout ratio increase over and above what we've seen so far? \nFrank Blake: The first is just on the assumptions. I mean we'll give you more guidance on 2010 in the fourth quarter, but I wouldn't be building an assumption that would have CapEx down going into 2010. Beyond that I mean, as Carol said, the way we're looking at this, this is a business that generates great cash flow and we're being very disciplined about our capital allocation. As we look into 2010 and beyond, as the business comes back, we'll look at how we balance both the payout ratio on the dividends, as well as what we can do on share repurchases, keeping in mind the guideline that Carol has referenced several times on the 2.5 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR. \nOperator: We'll now move on to Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets: Frank, you've called out residential investment spending before and did mention briefly in this morning's comments. Now that this metric has turned up for the first time since '05, has your thought process changed at all on the relevance of this metric to your own business? \nFrank Blake: I'd say a couple of things. First and the percent that fixed private residential investment makes to GDP turned up in the third quarter. So, it's now like 2.5% versus 2.4%. It is still down, year-over-year, over 20%. So, the measure is still down on year-over-year basis. Then you say going forward and I think even Chairman Bernanke referenced this yesterday, at least there is some sense that PFRI will actually sort of tick up as a percent as we go into 2010. When you look at our business, it's important to see two things; first, the housing dependency, which clearly part of that PFRI captures and also, what's happening with the consumer and consumer spending, consumer debt levels and obviously, the broader issues around unemployment. So, while we still think and I'll kind of keep using the data point as a relevant general data point for our market, it's also worth a cautionary note as we go into 2010 that we've got some additional issues just with the consumer base that we're going to have to be dealing as well. \nOperator: Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs has your next question. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: A couple of questions here. First of all, taking a high level look at the business, this quarter, you generated operating leverage for the first time since, I believe, the first quarter of 2006 and you did it on a negative seven comp. Obviously, there is some expense elements that are unlikely to be repeated quite to the same degree. I'm not thinking about the fourth quarter, where obviously there is such off-season and some other issues, but just in terms of the cost improvements that you generated. But still, as you look going toward, what do you think it would take you to lever the operating margin next year? Clearly, negative seven comp would be tough, but given that you have this precedent today, where do you think you could make this happen? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, we're working on our 2010 plan as we speak, as you can appreciate. To answer that question to your point, some of the cost out that we are enjoying this year, we won't repeat next year. For example, the renegotiation of the private-label credit card, we've taken $212 million out year-to-date. Our forecast is $250 million or something like that for the full year. Next year, we won't get that benefit. We took out support staff. Next year, we won't get that benefit. So, while we've actually lowered our cost structure, which is a good thing, as we think about how do we drive operating leverage going forward? We need positive comps. So as we think about how we build our plan next year, when those positive comps might occur, is it the second half of the year, when in the second half of the year? That will impact our ability to leverage expenses. We want to drive operating margin. As you know, Matt, our targets are to reach a 10% operating margin and a 15% return on capital margin. It's going to take a few years to get there, based on the sales environment, but we feel pretty good that we'll get there. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Then, one follow-up question, on the trajectory through the quarter just taking what you said to some of my counterparts as you've answered questions so far, you intimated that November rather was a bit better than October. Just looking at the compares in the U.S., they are relatively unchanged through the quarter. So are there any seasonal factors, other factors related to comparisons that would suggest that the trajectory would move around a lot over the course of the quarter? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, there is always the weather factor, of course, and we are seeing some pretty sales in some of the categories that Craig talked about, the core categories like roofing that we didn't have a year ago. \nOperator: Moving on, our next question comes from Budd Bugatch of Raymond James and Associates. \nT.J. McConville - Raymond James: This is actually T.J. McConville filling in for Budd, who is traveling today. I appreciate you taking my call. Frank, if we can return to the consumer versus the pro business. I know last quarter you gave us some really great detail as to what each represented as a percent of the whole using the new measurements you have. Can you give us that for the third quarter? \nFrank Blake: Yeah, TJ, first, I don't have that data set for the third quarter. It actually takes some time to generate this and we don't have it. What I would say, as I said in my prepared comments, it looks like it fundamentally didn't change too much in the third quarter, which would actually be consistent with your expectation when you think about what was happening in 2008. So the real question for us is going to be what happens particularly as we turn into 2010? Do we start to see some of that pick up a bit? \nT.J. McConville - Raymond James: Is there any discernible difference that you can draw based on geography or maybe based on the level at which housing markets were hit over the last few years, as to where the pro is maybe returning sooner or is it just sort of down everywhere across the board? \nFrank Blake: Again, it's not far off from what you'd expect. So, if you look out in the western part of the country, you don't see a lot of that business returning. Some of it is impacted by weather events. So there was a pick up in the Gulf and now, you're anniversarying that and you see probably an abnormal decline. But it would follow pretty much across, I mean we have looked at it regionally and there aren't huge regional variations, other than ones that you would otherwise be able to explain through weather and the like. \nDiane Dayhoff: Joseph, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from William Truelove of UBS. \nWilliam Truelove - UBS: In terms of merchandising, can you give us an idea of what's happening between the good, better and best categories? Are you seeing people transition back towards the higher end categories, only if it improves their efficiency and energy savings or is that sort of broad based situation for customers? Thanks. \nCraig Menear: Well, it really depends on the category and what's going on inside the category. So for example, when you look at our Allure vinyl flooring, which has a tendency to be in the more towards the upper opening price point to mid price point, doing extremely well. If you take our new Behr product primer and paint all-in-one, which is actually at the upper end of our liquid offering in paint, doing incredibly well. So, it really varies by category in terms of what's happening in the marketplace. There is not a pure pattern I guess that we could sit here and tell you that there's a shift in one direction or the other. \nWilliam Truelove - UBS: If I could ask one my one follow-up, then. Do you see any differential between the pro buyer in that kind of break down of categories versus the do-it-yourself category? \nCraig Menear: Not necessarily. There is not a big distinction. As a matter of fact, even in our Behr product, for example, we have a pretty good take up right now with the pro customer on that product because it does save them time. \nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you to everyone for joining us today and we really look forward to talking to you at the end of our fourth quarter on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nOperator: Once again, thank you for your participation.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Beginning today\u2019s discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Madam.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you, Augusta and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the Home Depot second quarter earnings conference call. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and Carol Tome, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analysts\u2019 questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors and as a reminder, we really would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up, please. This conference call is being broadcast real-time on the Internet at homedepot.com with links on both our homepage and the investor relations section. The replay will also be available on our site. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our investor relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentations also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided in the financial statements included with our earnings release. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $19.1 billion, down 9.1% from last year. Comp sales were negative 8.5% and excluding the charges related to the expo business closings, diluted earnings per share were $0.67.  Despite the negative sales environment and difficult market conditions, there were some significant positives for us in the quarter. As Craig will detail, we had positive comp transactions in the U.S. for the first time in more than five years. We also had the largest gain in total market share that we have seen in five years and we saw improved comp rates in some of our most important and most hard hit markets like Florida and California.  Craig and his team drove terrific values in innovation in core DIY projects and we achieved positive comps in paint and had a strong selling season in outside garden. We continue to make improvements in the underlying business. Since our last earnings call, we\u2019ve opened two new RDCs, one in Houston and one in Cincinnati. As of today, we have eight RDCs serving approximately 800 stores or more than 40% of our U.S. store base. Mark Holifield and his team, by the end of this quarter, will basically be opening an RDC every month. This is an impressive, maybe unprecedented pace for a large-scale supply chain effort.  Marvin Ellison and the store operations team have brought more focus and better execution on customer service and we see that through our net promoter scores, which take the percent of our customers who rate their experience with us as a 9 or a 10 and subtract from that the percent of customers who rate their experience as a 6 or worse.  Our net promoter score has improved approximately 1,000 basis points year over year and is now at 62.7%. It\u2019s particularly significant for us that our scores went up in the second quarter versus the first quarter since frequently there can be a deterioration of performance as foot traffic increases.  On the international front, our business in Mexico produced another solid quarter with positive single-digit comps in the face of a contracting economy. We had negative comps in both Canada and China but I should point out that the SAP implementation issues that impacted our Canadian business over the last several months have been largely resolved. The Canadian team is now focused on the business, not a system implementation.  We had good expense control across the board and managed inventory levels effectively by achieving flat inventory turns year-over-year. All in all, relative to our plan, we had a solid second quarter. As Carol will detail, based on our first half performance, we are lifting our earnings per share guidance for the year.  But the larger question for us is when will we start to see a broader market turnaround? We are now in the fourth year of a major correction in the housing and housing related markets? Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP is at 2.4%, the lowest it has been in over 60 years and down 30 basis points from the first quarter, which previously set a record low.  To understand the current trends across the country, we can look at the comp performance of our top 40 markets in the second quarter versus their comp performance in the first quarter. There is some encouraging news here, since nearly 75% of the markets perform better in the second quarter than the first and as indicated, we\u2019ve seen some significant improvement in California and Florida. In California, double-digit negative comps turned to single-digit negative and in Florida, while we still have some double-digit negative comp markets, the percentage comp decline is about half what it was in the second quarter last year.  But caution is still appropriate. We have some short-term sales headwinds in the back half of the year as we anniversary hurricane activity from last year and commodity inflation in fuel-related categories. More importantly, while the performance across most of our regions is better, we are still not seeing positive comps in any areas other than the areas impacted by hurricanes last year and while there was improvement in hard-hit markets like California and Florida, we remain concerned by the high level of foreclosure activity which we believe continues to put pressure on the housing markets in those areas as reflected in lower sales of basic building material products.  With the dunnhumby tools, we are also getting a clearer look at customer behavior across different segments of our shoppers. Again, there\u2019s a mixed picture. Some clear strength on the consumer side as basic DIY activity picks up but these tools also allow us to see some areas of stress with greater clarity.  For example, we have traditionally said that pro sales represent approximately 30% of our business. That turns out to be accurate as a statement of the past. What has happened in the downturn is that our pro business has declined more rapidly than our consumer business. As an indication of that, pro sales are now down to about 27% of our overall business versus approximately 32% at this time last year. A key element to returning to positive comps for us will be the recovery of this important segment.  Whatever the timing of a return to positive comps, our associates are doing an excellent job of laying the foundation for the future success of the business. We intend to reflect the heritage of this company by setting the standard for customer service and product authority in our market. It is a source of great pride for the company that even in these tough times, we will have record success sharing in the first half with 96% of our stores participating.  Now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank and good morning, everyone. As expected, our second quarter comp showed an improvement over the first quarter and we posted a positive comp in paint. The departments that outperformed the company\u2019s average comp were paint, seasonal, building materials, flooring, and plumbing.  Millwork, hardware, kitchens, lumber and electrical under-performed the company\u2019s average comp for the quarter.  We are very pleased with the progress we made in driving customers to our store during the quarter. Our total customer transactions were positive for the first time in two years at positive 0.3% and comp transactions were flat year over year. In the U.S., our comp transactions were up 0.4% and this is the first time since the second quarter of 2003 that we have not had a comp transaction decline in the U.S.  This increase was driven by innovative new product, enhanced customer service, and our continued commitment to drive value for our customers. We saw a marked improvement across several departments with lumber and building materials showing a material improvement in transactions, along with paint and seasonal businesses which experienced positive growth in transactions.  For average tickets of $50 and below, roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., transactions were up 3% year over year. This is the second consecutive quarter of positive transactions for tickets under $50.  The primary drivers of this were the continued strength of basic repair and maintenance categories, paint, and our seasonal garden business.  However, despite a slight improvement from the first quarter, average tickets of $900 and above, which also represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, transactions remain double-digit negative. Here the weakness continues in high dollar discretionary spend categories.  Our overall seasonal business results were mixed in the quarter. The usual summer heat never came in parts of the U.S. with June temperatures averaging their lowest in five years and July the coolest in 18.  As a result, products like air conditioners and fans under-performed compared to last year and negatively impacted U.S. comps by approximately half a point.  On the positive side, we were very pleased with our performance in lawn and garden. During the second quarter, we saw a positive comp growth across several product categories, like live goods, fertilizers, chemicals, seed and landscape products. In outdoor power equipment, sales significantly outperformed the company average and we grew share on the strength of our exclusive product offerings with Toro, Honda, Cub Cadet, Ryobi, and Home Life.  Paint is another area contributing to our positive transactions in the quarter. Guided by our portfolio strategies, the major investments we\u2019ve made in our paint department are clearly paying off. With the help of Matt Carey and his IT team, we completed the rollout of new paint tinning equipment across all of our U.S. stores, making the process more efficient for our associates and driving inventory efficiency by simplifying the tint base as required.  We also launched innovative product -- Behr\u2019s Premium Plus Ultra, a paint and primer all in one; Rustoleum\u2019s Ultra IIX Product, which delivers twice the paint in the can for about half the cost of competitive product; relaunched Glidden; and reset our applicator program, simplifying the offering for our customers.  As a result of these actions, the department showed a positive comp as we improved the total project sales and gained market share.  The downward pressure on ticket continues in construction categories and big ticket discretionary spend. In total, our average comp ticket for the second quarter was down 8.5%. In the U.S., our average comp ticket declined by $4.11, or 7.3%. Key contributors to the decline in average ticket were commodity categories, such as lumber, building materials, and electrical. Framing lumber and structural panel remains down about double-digit from a year ago; similarly, copper prices were still running on average about 40% lower than the same time last year. These impacts were partially offset by inflation in roofing.  Finally, in the second quarter big ticket discretionary projects like kitchens and millwork contributed over $1.00 reduction of the year-over-year average ticket decline.  Overall, we are continuing to make progress through the implementation of our portfolio strategy and the use of our new tools. We are committed to deliver value to our customers while managing the business in a tough environment. The team delivered a solid performance in inventory and gross margin dollar productivity, as you will hear from Carol. These efforts resulted in the company achieving total share gain during the quarter, despite having closed our expo business and significantly slowed new store growth.  Six of our 13 departments grew share in the second quarter compared to last year and additionally, several key classes saw unit share gains such as carpet, hand tools, hardware, toilets, molding, and cleaning, to name a few.  As we exit the busy spring selling season, we remain focused on providing value to our customers every day. Our organization and storage business is off to a great start. We have invested in a new merchandising set that provides an expanded offering of energy efficient CFLs and LED bulbs. We are providing online tools to educate customers on the importance of weatherization and simple projects like caulking. We are helping customers take advantage of the government sponsored tax credits on weatherization products like storm doors, and we are well-positioned to offer energy and money-saving products, along with fall project know-how.  And now I would like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol B. Tome: Thank you, Craig and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $19.1 billion, a 9.1% decrease from last year, reflecting negative comp or same-store sales of 8.5%, plus the net impact of fewer stores due to the closing of our expo businesses. While total company comps were negative 8.5%, we experienced great variability during the quarter, principally due to weather, with negative comps of 6.8% in May, negative 10.7% in June, and negative 8.1% in July. 1.6% of our comp decline is attributable to our international businesses, principally due to a weak sales environment in Canada and a considerably stronger U.S. dollar.  Comps for U.S. stores were negative 6.9% for the quarter, with negative comps of 4.7% in May, negative 9.8% in June, and negative 6.5% in July.  Earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.66, down 7% from last year. During the quarter, we had $20 million of expenses related to the closing of our expo businesses. Excluding the expo related expenses, adjusted earnings per share were $0.67.  Our gross margin was 33.5% in the second quarter, an increase of 32 basis points from last year. Our U.S. stores reported 38 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, driven principally by two factors -- first, we had lower markdowns than last year as we anniversaried clearance markdowns that we did not need to repeat this year and second, favorable shrink performance.  Through our focus bay portfolio approach, our U.S. merchants continued to introduce new lower prices while growing overall gross margins. The U.S. gross margin expansion was offset by 6 basis points of margin contraction arising from our non-U.S. businesses due to certain higher costs.  Now, you may recall that in the first quarter, our Canadian business experienced significant margin contraction as it worked through inventory and other adjustments related to our score or SAP conversion. I am pleased to report that our Canadian team worked diligently to resolve these issues and our Canadian gross margin rate is back on track.  Operating expenses increased by 43 basis points to 23.9% for the quarter. As a percent of sales, our expense deleverage reflects the impact of negative comp sales. We experienced another solid quarter of expense control, with expenses coming in roughly $20 million under our plan.  We are seeing some benefits from some fundamental changes we\u2019ve implemented to improve spending efficiency in our business. For example, earlier this year we introduced an automated checkbook in our stores. This is a great tool that allows our store managers to manage their expenses on a real-time basis. Managers can see how their expenses are trending relative to their [inaudible], and make on-the-spot adjustments. Essentially, this tool gives our associates the power to control what they can control in order to run a better business.  As a general rule of thumb, we expect to deleverage expenses by about 10 basis points for every point of negative comp. Year-to-date, we are running much better than that, due to our strong expense control and the impact of a lower cost of private label credit.  As we have previously discussed, the year-over-year benefit arising from our private label credit renegotiation will be more pronounced in the first half of the year than the second half.  Additionally, the weighting of our sales distribution is higher in the first half than the back half. About 68% of our expenses are fixed, so we would expect more expense deleverage in the back half than the first half of the year.  For the year, we believe that our general rule of thumb of approximately 10 basis points of expense deleverage for every point of negative comp holds true. Our operating margin was 9.6% in the second quarter, down 12 basis points from last year. In the second quarter, our income tax provision rate was 33.3%, down from 36.2% last year, due primarily to a favorable foreign tax settlement. This settlement reduced our tax expense by approximately $50 million for the quarter and provided approximately $0.03 of earnings per share benefit. As a result of the settlement, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 35% for the year.  Now moving to our operational metric, during the second quarter we opened three new stores and closed one store in China for an ending store count of 2,240. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 235 million, down eight-tenths of 1% from last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the second quarter were $322, down roughly 8%.  Now turning to the balance sheet -- inventory remains a good news story. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $10.8 billion, down approximately $1.1 billion or 9% from last year. On a per store basis, inventory was down 8.3%.  Inventory turns were 4.3 times, flat to last year. We ended the quarter with $44 billion in assets, including $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2008, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $3.7 billion, offset by $353 million of capital expenditures and $762 million of dividends paid.  As a reminder, we have a $3.25 billion A2P2 commercial paper program that is 100% back stopped by a committed long-term bank line of credit. As of the end of the second quarter, we had no outstanding commercial paper.  We have approximately $11.4 billion of outstanding debt, of which $1 billion comes due in the third quarter and $750 million comes due in the fourth quarter of 2009. At this point, it is our intent to repay the debt maturities as they come due using cash generated by the business.  Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity of the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was approximately 9.3%. On an adjusted basis, excluding charges related to our 2008 store rationalization actions and the closing of our expo businesses, return on invested capital was 10.3%.  We [inaudible] control what we can control. We are focused on executing our strategic imperatives and our financial results reflect the success that we\u2019ve had thus far. Our results for the first half of the year were better than our plans but as Frank mentioned, the external signals call for caution. We are comfortable with the sales guidance we gave at our June investor conference, as we still believe sales will be down roughly 9% for the year.  On the earnings front, based on our first half performance, we are lifting our guidance and are calling for fiscal 2009 earnings per share from continuing operations to be flat to up 7% for the year, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to be down 15% to 20%.  Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Augusta, we are now ready for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Maggie Gilliam with Gilliam & Company.\nMaggie Gilliam - Gilliam & Company: I wonder if you could please talk a little bit more about Canada and the SAP initiative, whether you have learned anything from it yet regarding adopting it in the United States? And also, what kind of merchandising initiatives are you pursuing vis-\u00e0-vis Canada and the U.S., Canada being a place where you are selling more d\u00e9cor products?\nCraig Menear: Okay, Maggie, thanks very much for the question. Actually here, Matt Carey is here and probably is in the best position to talk about some of the SAP implementation points. I will say to the latter part of your question in terms of the merchandising initiatives that one of the great things about having the Canadian business is that they do go out and do some things a little bit differently than we do in the U.S. and as you said, that some of their stores are significantly more project focused and d\u00e9cor project focused and the Canadian team has had great success with that.  The Canadian team actually was early on adopter of eco options, which we then took that program and as you know are running with it in the United States. So a lot of the things that they do in Canada in terms of merchandising initiatives, we\u2019re then able to transplant here so it\u2019s terrific to have that group working on different ideas.  SAP implementation was very much a part of that, in terms of being able to use the Canadian business to understand what an effort of that magnitude might look like for us and so with that, let me just turn it over to Matt to make a couple of comments on the SAP implementation. \nMatt Carey: Good morning, Maggie. What I would tell you is that as we said in the past, we\u2019re going to continue to kind of monitor and watch this SAP performance, the implementation of that system has kind of smoothed out from my perspective and I think from the Canadian team\u2019s perspective. We\u2019ve obviously learned a lot of things about how to do change in our environment and we will continue to apply those learnings as we modify systems in the chain.  We also have found a few things that we would like to bring to the U.S. around labeling and signing, as well as things in the U.S. that we would like to put in Canada around data maintenance and some of the other things, so we are going to continue to share best practices where appropriate and we will continue to look at the SAP implementation in Canada as a learning lesson that might inform us about future decisions. \nFrank Blake: And I would also just make a general comment on that, Maggie, that as we think about the SAP implementation, there are really two sets of issues. There\u2019s first, what\u2019s the performance in Canada and what do we learn from that performance? And then also, what do we do in the U.S. and what have we learned over the last year in terms of what we are capable of doing in the U.S. without a major implementation like that? And we\u2019ve seen a lot of progress in the last year on that side of the ledger. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Stephen Chick with FBR.\nStephen Chick - FBR: Thanks. A couple of questions -- I guess on -- I appreciate the clarity that you provided on the pro commercial percentages, you know, 27% I think for this quarter, down from a year ago, 32% if I took that down right. Can you give us an idea of what the trajectory of that has been and can you confirm, is that -- do you think of that as higher profit margin business relative to the non-commercial, or is it the other way around?\nFrank Blake: Okay. Thanks, Steve -- first on the trajectory, it\u2019s interesting because -- and this is -- frankly a lot of these trends we might not have see but for a better understanding of some of our underlying data. A significant difference in how the pro business reacted post September 2008 versus the consumer business and when you think about it, it actually makes some sense that the pro business was under more pressure from September 2008 going forward. The consumer business was also under pressure -- it was just the pro business was under more pressure. So that\u2019s the trajectory that we have seen, kind of pretty much following, if you kind of do October 2008 on.  In terms of the margin performance, what you would see with the bulk of our pros is they shop the whole store and so the margin performance around the pro is not that -- is not that dissimilar from the consumer.  Craig, do you want to add anything on that?\nCraig Menear: Steve, I would tell you that from a ticket standpoint, you know, our pro average ticket, as you might imagine, is a higher average ticket and of course their frequency of shop is higher than our average customer, so those are both downward pressures against those metrics. \nStephen Chick - FBR: Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then second, if I could, I think related to maybe Craig\u2019s comments on ticket sales above 900, did -- I just want to make sure I kind of took it down right -- is it -- it\u2019s a double-digit decline. Is that a lesser -- I think last quarter you had -- I thought you had said down 15%. Is it down less than that rate or is it more? And is the geographic makeup of your sales, like the improvements in California, has that helped that metric?\nCraig Menear: The metric is still double-digit negative and it has improved slightly from the first quarter and in the first quarter it was down approximately 15% and it is -- it is really driven across several areas of the business. As we see it, we had transaction improvement in our lumber and building materials areas. Part of that was driven through outdoor projects, part of it was just driven through DIY projects but I wouldn\u2019t say that it was specific to one area. \nStephen Chick - FBR: Okay, it\u2019s just interesting because your competitor said I think the opposite but I am not sure why that is but okay, all right. Great. Thanks, Craig. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot and good morning. Carol, if you could give us some specifics on the impact of credit to the expense line this quarter and then also offer up color on what you are seeing in terms of turn-downs and general use of the private label credit card and other credit related forms of payment, that would be great. \nCarol B. Tome: Yes, I\u2019d be happy to. First on the expense line, year-over-year we had a $42 million benefit as a result of a lower cost of private label credit and year-to-date, the benefit is about $160 million.  Relative to what we are seeing with the consumer and credit, we are seeing a shift. Total credits penetration, and that includes not only our private label card but Visa, MasterCard, et cetera -- last year total credit penetration was about 65%. This year total credit penetration, about 62%, so a 300 basis point contraction, if you will, and that\u2019s all in our private label credit. So private label credit has dropped from 28% penetration last year to 25% this year.  Now in terms of what we are seeing with our customers, for anyone who is applying for a private label credit card, about 76% of all applications are approved. That\u2019s down about 50 basis points from last year.  In terms of the average credit line that is being approved, it\u2019s about $5,2000. That\u2019s down $1,600 from last year. The through-the-door FICO scores for those who are being approved is about 712, up slightly from last year. If you look at our existing cardholders, those who are just using the card within the store, the average FICO score is 677, which is about the same as it was last year.  So hopefully that gives you some color on the consumer. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: And how does the $5200 compare with the average outstanding line? I know that\u2019s kind of approved capacity but where is the average line for your program?\nCarol B. Tome: It\u2019s a little north of $6,000 and the average utilization is about 25%. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Only 25%? So in essence the credit card companies are taking down risk but not necessarily cutting off the actual spending needs of most of your customers?\nCarol B. Tome: Other than those who are defaulting, that\u2019s correct. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: That\u2019s fair. Okay, thank you so much. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scott Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScott Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets : Can you guys point to the reasons why you think California has improved, especially in the face of the unemployment situation in that state? Do you think that\u2019s simply a function of improving housing turnover or are there other factors at work?\nFrank Blake: Well, first you do -- weather does play a role in our business and we had a streak of some very nice seasonable weather out in California and in our western division that helped with our outside garden sales. I would say also as we\u2019ve talked about before, you do have a churn of some houses as they go through the foreclosure process that drives things like paint, drives things like carpet upgrades and the like. And that\u2019s balanced against a larger drag that we think there is, as you go through accelerating foreclosures and that kind of slows down some of your basic building material business. Is that helpful?\nScott Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets : All right, that\u2019s it. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. \nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank: Thanks, guys. So two questions -- one is you said that you gained share in six of seven categories, yet it was your biggest share gain in five years. I think previous quarters you have gained in seven categories and then the quarter before that, nine categories. So I guess the way you reconcile those is in the six categories we gained share, the share gains must have been out-sized, given where they have been, so can you discuss where that is?\nFrank Blake: Mike, first and I\u2019ll turn this to Craig to address but I would also offer this caution as we go through the share data -- our market doesn\u2019t have a lot of really clear share markers and one of the things when we reference, when Craig was referencing the six areas where we gained share, that was largely around the consumer. And then if you remember that e have a substantial percentage of our business that\u2019s also pro and both the pro and the consumer data is reflected in the overall market share, which is the number I referenced, you can see that you\u2019ve got some goes ins and goes outs there that don\u2019t always neatly fit together.  But Craig, if -- \nCraig Menear: Yeah, so the reference was that six of our 13 departments on the consumer side gained share in the quarter and that was around paint, hardware, plumbing, both our lawn and garden categories, both sides of that business, both in power equipment as well as nursery and landscape. As well as appliances gained share in the quarter.  And then if you look at the total that Frank was referencing and as we look at both consumer and pro and compare that, it was our largest share gain that we\u2019ve had and we broke the 20% mark at the end of July. \nCarol B. Tome: And just to give a little bit more information on the market share, when we talk about overall total company market share, we reference our performance against the NYEX 444, which is census data, and we think that\u2019s the best representation of both the pro and the consumer market. \nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank: Right, yeah, I think that makes sense. Okay, thanks for the color -- the one last just sort of maintenance question is on the earnings guidance, so is the right pace $1.42 from last year when we are thinking about flat to up about 7%? And then does that include the $0.03 -- I think it does include but confirm, does that include the $0.03 tax benefit you got this quarter?\nCarol B. Tome: Yes, our guidance includes the $0.03 tax benefit that we got this and let\u2019s just use adjusted -- the adjusted earnings per share that we are guiding off of from last year is $1.78. \nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you. \nCarol B. Tome: You\u2019re welcome. \nOperator: Our next question is from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Thank you. Two questions -- one is a crystal ball question -- when you look at all the macro data, should we be starting to think that we can actually see positive comps?\nFrank Blake: Gary, I would say it will be some time we\u2019re thinking in 2010 and probably second quarter or back half of 2010. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Okay. And the second is you talked about power tools in some of the private label and there\u2019s been some discussion about how well you are doing with some of your technology innovations. Could you go into like an area like power tools in a bit of detail? And then discuss -- is that why you think you are gaining share in those categories?\nFrank Blake: Well, we really believe that we have a great lineup that services both our pro and our DIY customer in power tools. We certainly focus on key brands within that product category that our pro customers want. We have focused on launching and trying to be ahead of the game on lithium technology, which delivers more power, longer run-time, better battery life for our pro customers. When you look at the innovation over the years that we\u2019ve been able to bring with the Ryobi program on the consumer side, with the lowest replacement costs of batteries pretty much in the market. It has become a great product for both our pro and light duty -- or light duty pro and our DIY customers, so we believe that the strong focus on brands that dominate the market and positioning ourselves with advanced technology has helped us in that product category. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: How do you get that message out to the customers, both consumer and pro?\nFrank Blake: That\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s something that we think we have opportunity to improve upon. But we are obviously working with our suppliers on that and we are working on our -- with our marketing team to enhance that messaging. But it\u2019s an upside opportunity for us. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Dan Binder with Jefferies. \nDan Binder - Jefferies & Company: Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on whether or not deflation across the entire box had a meaningful impact and whether or not you were able to grab a little extra margin as prices came down to you and any lag time that may have existed with that passing through to the customer. \nFrank Blake: So when you look at the big impacts, lumber was about a 39 basis point impact, wire was about 28 base points, but that was offset by building materials to a degree at plus 29. But from a margin impact, I mean, the market moves with the cost market when it comes to retail, so there\u2019s really not much of an impact on margin at all. \nDan Binder - Jefferies & Company: Okay, and then secondly, you addressed the credit in quite a bit of detail. I\u2019m just curious -- are you starting to see any reversal or loosening of credit with your credit partner, versus let\u2019s say six months ago?\nFrank Blake: No, we\u2019re not. \nCarol B. Tome: -- have to go back and talk to them now that he asked the question. \nDan Binder - Jefferies & Company: Okay, and then just finally, is your big ticket exposure materially higher in Q3 and Q4 versus the front half of the year?\nFrank Blake: No, it really is not. It\u2019s pretty consistent across the quarters. \nDan Binder - Jefferies & Company: Okay, great. Thanks. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Frank, I was really kind of very interested in your comments about the pro versus the consumer and that 32% and 27%, if my math is correct and I applied it correctly, it looks like the pro business year over year in the quarter was down around 24% while the consumer business was down somewhere between 2.5% to 3%? Am I thinking about that right first? \nFrank Blake: Your math is very good, Budd. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: And secondly then, can you give us some more color of what may be driving the pro business or not driving it? Is there a net promoter score that\u2019s attached to it? Is there some color on ticket or have you lost share in pros or the number of pros that you are being able to serve?\nFrank Blake: So I would say, Budd, it\u2019s -- and again if -- let me preface this by saying if we had been looking at this with the data set that we had previously applied, we would have said the pro and consumer business were down roughly the same. We\u2019ve taken a different cut at the data set that looks more at buying behavior than an SIC code because the fact is pros don\u2019t come in with a little badge that says I am a pro, and that\u2019s what I referenced in terms of the dunnhumby data -- we\u2019re looking at buying behavior, so maybe the single-most accurate way of saying it is people who bought like pros in 2008 this time versus people who were buying like pros in 2009 is down significantly. And then when you think through why that would be, first you\u2019ve got a lot of very basis things, which is you look at that private fixed residential investment number which has a lot of what you would call pro-related spend in and you would see if anything our decline is less dramatic than the decline in that indicator, which would also be consistent with what we see in the share data. But you\u2019ve got high unemployment in the construction trades, you\u2019ve got a lot of pressure obviously in home building, a lot of pressure in larger projects that we think goes into that number and I would say the other thing underneath it is we then sub-segment that into different kinds of pro like buying behavior and look at the different patterns within that and again, as you might anticipate it, the folks who are more maintenance repair, operations related pros are responding differently than a general contractor pro. So I hope that color helps. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: It does, and when you say responding differently, I hope they are responding better, almost more like the consumer side of it, so it\u2019s the heavier pro that has really been more impacted, because the MRO has got to go on anyway. \nMarvin R. Ellison: The pros are pretty resilient, so that MRO customer now has become a maintenance repair kind of customer because they are trying to find a way to stay busy. But again, just like the normal consumer when this market gets more difficult than they find different ways to spend, their spending patterns change but they still have to try to keep business going and we spend a lot of time in the relationships that we\u2019ve built with pro customers, talking to them about the different projects they are working on and we try to make the necessary merchandising adjustments to give them what they need so they can in act continue to stay busy. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: I\u2019ve got you, and if I can sneak in one more question for Carol, you gave us the year-over-year second quarter on credit and the year-to-date, could you remind us what your forecast was for the year on credit benefit or -- and is that still the same?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, we told you that our cost of private label credit would not exceed 1.5% of credit sales and we asked you to use a number of about 30% penetration. Obviously our penetration is down so we didn\u2019t give you a clear dollar figure for the year-over-year benefit. We might have guided around $250 million, something like that, for the year. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: And that\u2019s still intact?\nCarol B. Tome: Yeah. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Thanks, Carol. Thank you, Frank. Thank you, Marvin. \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Thanks and good morning. First of all, a question -- any comment on -- it seems like July seemed to have an early -- earlier in July was tougher and it seemed to recover towards the end of the month. Any comment on how August is shaping up, particularly with some of the better weather in the Northeast? And second, really bigger picture as we think about the back half of the year, seasonal mix does come down, or at least the outdoor mix does come down as a percentage of sales. I mean, how do you merchandise into that and how do you -- do you think -- how does the increased DIY trend that we\u2019ve seen in the first half kind of manifest itself in the back half of the years, whether it\u2019s snowblowers or what have you?\nCarol B. Tome: Well, I can give you color on how we are performing in August and then Craig can talk to you about what we are doing for the back half from a merchandising perspective.  As we built our plan, we told you that the comps in the first half of the year would be worse than the comps in the back half of the year and we still think that could be true. The third quarter, there\u2019s a lot of noise in the third quarter because we are anniversarying hurricanes, et cetera, so we don\u2019t expect the third quarter to be materially different than that of the second quarter. We exited the quarter with a total company comp of a negative 8.1% in July and that\u2019s where we are running today, so we are running at where we thought we would for the August period to date.  We\u2019ve got a lot of good things going in the merchandising perspective. \nCraig Menear: Yeah, if you think about the seasonal business, as you were saying the trend falls off as you move into the third quarter, first step back and recognize that that happens every year so our comparisons are the same, if you will, year over year. And then we\u2019ll really focus as we move into the third quarter on those things that become really important to the customer at that timeframe. The finishing up of outdoor projects that prepares their homes for the winter season, as customers are beginning to think more about energy and focusing their on how to prepare their homes -- you know, we\u2019ll be focused in those areas. Fall clean-up -- those are all simple, easy projects that a customer can take on and be prepared.  And then of course, there is the -- what I\u2019ll call simple d\u00e9cor updates that will take place in the fall season as well. We fully expect there to be continued pressure in the big ticket discretionary spend but the simple updates of the home are the areas that we will focus on. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: And just as a follow-up, is it all moot if California and Florida continue to sequentially improve? I mean, does the whole seasonal outdoor question really become a moot question?\nCraig Menear: I think when we look at California in the second quarter, you know, as Frank said, we certainly had some benefit from good weather and that helped drive the outdoor business but I also -- when we look at the numbers, we\u2019re seeing a relatively solid performance in DIY projects. \nCarol B. Tome: It is really because of the seasonal nature of our business. It\u2019s important to look at our business year over year rather than sequentially -- 55% of our sales occur in the first six months of the year and that holds true in a down market as well as an up market. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Right, but I\u2019m saying like assuming big ticket doesn\u2019t really come back, right and that remains under increased pressure -- if California and Florida recover at the end of the day, that could overwhelm that aspect?\nFrank Blake: Certainly the recovery of California and Florida, if I understand your question, Chris, that would be helpful. Again, understand that that\u2019s only a percentage of our business but that would be helpful. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: Thank you. Good morning, or basically one question -- the upside performance relative to plan on sales, and I believe on gross margin, can you identify or at least bucket what you think drove that or allowed you to accomplish that in the quarter?\nCraig Menear: I think we have a continued focus first of all on driving value in the marketplace for our customers. I think Marvin and the operations team have done an outstanding job of really focusing on customer service. And then we believe that we are getting traction in terms of doing a better job through our new marketing campaign of beginning to communicate the value proposition that we have as a company. \nCarol B. Tome: We didn\u2019t plan for positive comp transactions. \nCraig Menear: Right. \nMarvin R. Ellison: I think, Eric, one thing to consider, Carol cited the inventory reduction year over year but we also are experiencing our best in-stock percent that we really have on record. I\u2019ve been here seven years, we measured it the same way for seven years and we now have our best in-stock position in the stores with the degree of inventory take-out, so you couple all those things together and we feel very, very good about our progress. \nFrank Blake: And then secondly, as far as the expense leverage, obviously the market share performance would suggest you are adequately investing in the business but I just would be interested in a little bit of the thought process of limiting the SG&A or the expense growth to the degree that you are, if there\u2019s any concern that you might be under-investing in the business?\nFrank Blake: No, we very consciously set out objectives we have for improving our business and have identified areas where we are and have been consistently investing. There are other areas where we have been able to trim back and we think they are largely non-customer focusing areas and we think those are appropriate and sustainable. \nCarol B. Tome: Right, and on the capital side, we told you that we deliberately back-end weighted our capital spending, given the economic uncertainty so you may say well, are you a little light on capital for the first half? No, this is what we said we would do. We\u2019ve got about $650 million remaining in our plan and we will spend it by the end of the year. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: Great. Thank you. \nDiane Dayhoff: We have time for one more question. \nOperator: All right -- our final question will come from Gregory Melich with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Thanks, guys. A follow-up for Craig and then Carol -- Craig, on the gross margin side, if one of the ways we are able to get inventory, that great inventory performance and keep in-stocks up, are we taking down SKU counts? Is that part of the focus bay approach? And if so, how far are we in that process? And I had a follow-up for Carol. \nCraig Menear: So first of all, if you look at gross margin, we\u2019ve been telling you that we\u2019ve been working hard on process and the implementation of new tools, including forecasting tools and our assortment maintenance tool, which allows us to better position product in the right places. That has begun to pay off for us and as we mentioned, we have not spent the money in clearance where we did last year because we\u2019ve gotten really inventory in the right spots.  Part of our portfolio strategy approach based on the specific roll and intent of specific categories is in fact looking at the assortment breadth and we have, where appropriate, been reducing SKUs to simplify for our customers. As a matter of fact, in the applicator reset that we just put into the stores, we had a fairly significant reduction in SKUs and that, to be honest with you, Greg, will be ongoing work and it\u2019s category by category. Some categories may actually expand in SKU count while others will go down. \nMarvin R. Ellison: There\u2019s two other points I will make on in-stock -- if you have frequented our stores over the years, you would notice that our overheads are much emptier today than probably ever before because there\u2019s been a concerted effort on improving the operational process in the stores but also the supply chain improvements allow us to take product from receiving to the shelf versus from receiving to the overhead as we\u2019ve done over the course of the past few years, so operation improvements in the store, our supply improvements just allow us to have the inventory in the right place so customers can actually buy it. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And then Carol, on the deleverage effect, the 10 basis points or 100 basis points a comp, as we go into the future into next year and beyond, is there something that\u2019s changed in the supply chain or the fixed cost structure that makes you think that that won\u2019t revert back to a 20 basis point per 100 once we cycle the credit and expo closing? Is there something that\u2019s changed there or is that a -- \nCarol B. Tome: Our rule of thumb is in a negative comp environment. Once we turn positive and we heard from Frank that will happen next year, once we turn positive we would expect to see more than 10 basis points of expense leverage.  Now, we are like all companies in corporate America, are faced with rising medical costs, other costs that are coming with us, so we\u2019ve got to work those through our model before we can give you our general rule of thumb. But where we sit today, we would expect to see more than 10 basis points. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Great, and then Frank, is that the -- in the second quarter, is that the first month of the second quarter or is that July?\nFrank Blake: Exactly -- wish I knew. \nGregory Melich - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. \nFrank Blake: Okay, thanks very much. \nDiane Dayhoff: Thanks to everybody for joining us today and we look forward to talking with you next quarter."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-05-19 15:00:35", "content": "Executives: Diane Dayhoff - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Frank Blake - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear - Senior Vice President, Merchandising Carol B.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks and introductions I will turn the conference over to Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nDiane Dayhoff:  Thank you and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the Home Depot first quarter earnings conference call. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising and Carol Tome, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services.  Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analysts\u2019 questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors and as a reminder we would appreciate if the participants would really limit themselves to one question with one follow-up, please.  This conference call is being broadcast real-time on the Internet at homedepot.com with links on both our homepage and the Investor Relations section. The replay will also be available on our site. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our investor relations department at 770-384-2387.  Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake. \nFrank Blake:  Thank you, Diane. Good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $16.2 billion, down 9.7% from last year. Comp sales were negative 10.2%. Excluding the charges related to the Expo business closings diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35.\n : The external environment remains difficult. Private, fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP is now at 2.7%. This is down 40 basis points from the fourth quarter and is well below the 60-year average of 4.8% and also below the previous 60-year low of 3.2%. We have referenced this number previously as an indicator of the health of our market and we have seen a substantial contraction from a few years ago when the percentage reached as high as 6.25%.  We believe that most of the correction on this index is now behind us but there remain mixed signals elsewhere within the market. On the positive side, year-over-year 21 markets out of our top 40 markets are showing a lower rate of decline. We positively comped in our Gulf region, principally because of storm recovery, and major markets within the Ohio valley region returned to positive comps. We have also seen significant improvement in comp transactions.  As Carol will detail, we had a very soft February in the U.S. with particular weakness in our western division but saw improvement through the remainder of the quarter. We are concerned about accelerating rates of foreclosures, particularly in the western part of the country where there is already a high density of houses in foreclosure.  In the fourth quarter of 2008 we saw foreclosures decelerate in areas of California and along with that an improvement in our comps. Those trends reversed this past quarter which provides a cautionary note on signaling a recovery prematurely. One out of every 54 households in California is in foreclosure. That is the highest it has ever been and before we see real improvement we believe we need to see sustainable deceleration in foreclosures.  Overall it is important to emphasize that most of our markets that are improving versus last year are only showing a slower rate of decline, not positive comps. Getting to less bad is not the same as getting to recovery. Whatever the longer term significance of these different signals, we continue to focus on improving our business. We have a lot of opportunity there and I think we have made some significant progress.  In the first quarter we gained share in 7 of 13 departments, reduced inventory by over $1 billion and maintained a strong in-stock position in our stores. We also drove footsteps into our stores through our portfolio strategy and our new lower price program. Our comp transactions were down only 2.6% year-over-year which is the best performance on transactions we have had in seven quarters.  Our customer service continues to improve. Our store operations team has rolled out new, customer first training to all our store associates and support staff and has brought simplification and focus across the business. We are seeing the benefit of this in improved customer service ratings. Our net promoter score, which is calculated by taking the percentage of our customers who rate their experience as a 9 or a 10 and subtracting from that the percent who rate their experience as a 6 or worse, has improved 790 basis points year-over-year and is now at 61.5%. That is a meaningful improvement.  About a month ago we opened our sixth RDC in Valdosta, Georgia. This is an important milestone because it is the first of our RDC\u2019s that is mechanized and the planned future state of our RDC\u2019s is as mechanized facilities. We are very pleased with the performance of our RDC network and RDC\u2019s now service approximately 600 of our stores and the roll out will continue.  We are also making significant progress on our merchandising tools in the U.S. and that is reflected in the performance in the first quarter. These tools are helping us better control inventory in general as well as clearance and mark down management. Our core retail efforts in Canada, however, have experienced some difficulties. A software implementation of this scale often entails some set backs. What we are seeing is that the effort itself diverts attention from the core business. It also takes time for merchants and operators to effectively utilize unfamiliar tools and some of the tools themselves require tuning.  Some of Canada\u2019s under-performance over the last few months is attributable to these factors. These issues will get resolved and we are fortunate to have a very dedicated Canadian team to take on the twin challenges of a major system implementation and market correction at the same time.  Also on the international front, our Mexican business again posted positive comps while our business in China posted low single digit negative comps reflecting the decelerating environment. Next month the Home Depot will celebrate its 30th anniversary. It is as true today as it was 30 years ago that our associates and culture set us apart. Based on this quarter\u2019s results, 85% of our stores would qualify for success sharing, our program for rewarding our hourly associates. We are proud of this level of participation and proud of the work our associates do day in and day out.  Now let me turn the call over to Craig. \nCraig Menear :  Thanks Frank. Good morning everyone. Our sales reflected the ongoing weakness in the home improvement market. For the quarter every merchandising department experienced negative comp sales growth compared to the first quarter of 2008. In the first quarter departments that out-performed the company\u2019s average comp were seasonal, building materials, paint, plumbing and flooring. Electrical, millwork, lumber, kitchens and hardware under-performed the company\u2019s average comp for the quarter.  While we saw weakness across the stores in the U.S. we identified four trends of relative strength across product categories. First, seasonal categories related to outdoor projects like landscaping, live goods, fertilizer and seed showed flat or positive growth in the quarter. We saw strength in vegetable and herb sales as more customers are opting to grow their own vegetable gardens.  Second, as we shared with you in past quarters, basic repair and maintenance categories remain resilient across the country. Categories like caulk and water heaters and air circulation, fasteners, plumbing repair and roofing all performed better than the company average.  Third, we saw simple remodel and d\u00e9cor categories gain some strength in the quarter. These are categories that help customers update their home in a cost-effective way such as interior paint, special order carpet, in-stock carpet, vinyl flooring, ceramic tile and window coverings.  Finally, there was an increase in safety and security products. We believe the tougher economic times have made customers focus on safety. Categories like door locks and exterior security lighting performed better than the company average.  For average tickets of $50 and below, roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., sales were basically flat year-over-year. Average tickets of $900 and above, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. business, sales were down around 15%. In total, average ticket for the first quarter was down 8.2% to $52.67. Adjusted for currency, average ticket was down 6.2%.  The pressure on ticket comes from the softness in construction and discretionary categories. Products like dimensional lumber, gypsum, concrete and wire performed poorly in the quarter. Additionally we continue to see weakness in discretionary spend categories such as lighting, appliances, replacement windows and closet system remodels. We believe customers remain cautious about spending in this environment.  In general, commodity pricing has been more stable in the quarter. Wire is experiencing significant deflation from the same period last year with copper costs down more than 50% from a year ago. Lumber continues to be at historic lows but we see offsets to these through inflation in areas like roofing and fertilizer. Despite soft sales our focus on improving merchandising processes and implementing improvements with our merchandising tools allowed us to better manage the business.  As a result, this quarter we delivered share gains, inventory improvement and solid gross margin in the U.S. We have now experienced our sixth consecutive quarter of U.S. gross margin expansion at the same time we introduced new lower price. For the total company, inventory was down over $1 billion and inventory turns were flat year-over-year. We did this while maintaining a high in-stock level.  While there are several economic factors affecting our results that we cannot control, we have continued to focus on those areas that we can control. Our portfolio strategy and expanded use of our merchandising tools combined with excellent collaboration and execution across operations and supply chain helped provide market share gains. Seven of our 13 departments experienced share gains during the quarter and we saw sequential share gain in our overall business each month of the quarter.  The continued focus on providing great value for our customers helped drive traffic into our stores. Our merchants did an outstanding job heading into the spring selling season supplementing our everyday great values with special buys which helped our suppliers move product while creating excitement in our stores. With the use of our forecasting and assortment tools we had great sell through on these products. Additionally, and most importantly, this effort combined with great in-store execution and selling the project has resulted in good attachment on those special buys, boosting both sales and gross margin dollars.  The result of this can be seen in our comp transactions which were negative 2.6% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 where comp transaction were negative 5.8%. We feel good about our execution as we head into the heart of our spring selling season. We utilized our assortment management tools to refine our seasonal assortments and strengthened the value segment in the opening and middle price points. We feel confident we will aggressively drive value for our customers while maintaining our disciplined control over the business in this challenging environment.  Finally, I am pleased to announce that Bill [Lenny] has rejoined the team as Senior Vice President of International Merchandising and we couldn\u2019t be more happy to have him back.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol Tome :  Thank Craig and hello everyone. In the first quarter sales were $16.2 billion, a 9.7% decrease from last year. Comps for same store sales were negative 10.2% for the quarter with negative comps of 12.2% in February, negative 9.2% in March and negative 9.7% in April. Roughly 9% of our sales are from outside of the U.S. Versus last year, we saw significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all currencies. Fluctuating exchange rates negative impacted our total company comp by approximately 190 basis points.  This was offset by a 30 basis point benefit arising from comp sales growth outside of the U.S. Comps for U.S. stores were negative 8.6% for the quarter with negative U.S. comps of 11% in February, negative 7.2% in March and negative 8% in April. Our financial results include the impact of several strategic actions in both the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. We detailed the financial impact of those actions on an exhibit to our press release which sets forth reported and adjusted results for both quarters.  For the first quarter of 2009 our financial results were impacted by the closing of the Expo businesses. Sales from liquidated inventory were $221 million. Gross profit on those sales was $29 million and the operating expense of the stores including their closing costs was $146 million for a net reduction in operating profit of $117 million.  Earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were $0.30, up 43% from last year. Excluding the Expo impact adjusted earnings per share were $0.35 compared to last year\u2019s adjusted earnings per share of $0.41.  In the first quarter our gross margin was 33.7%, a decrease of 22 basis points from last year. Our U.S. stores reported 29 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter driven by margin improvements in certain commodity classes, some shift in sales penetration and improved shrink performance. Through our focused [pay] portfolio approach, our U.S. merchants continue to introduce new lower prices while growing overall gross margins.  The U.S. gross margin expansion was offset by two key factors. First, and as expected, the margin rate on Expo merchandise was considerably lower than last year as we liquidated the Expo business. Mark down\u2019s taken as part of our Expo closings negatively impacted gross margin by 24 basis points. Second, we realized 27 basis points of margin contraction arising from our non-U.S. businesses, principally Canada, as we continue to work through inventory and other adjustments related to our score or SAP conversion.  On a reported basis, we leveraged expenses as a percent of sales by 220 basis points but the numbers are distorted because of the strategic charges in both quarters. On an adjusted basis operating expense as a percent of sales increased by 23 basis points to 27.1%. For the year, we expect to de-leverage expenses by about 13 basis points for every point of negative comp. Based on this you would have expected us to de-lever expenses by about 133 basis points in the quarter. We were 110 basis points better than that due to a couple of reasons.  First, we were $80 million under our expense plan in the quarter and that explains about 40 basis points of the difference. Some of this was timing, such as advertising, and some of this was just better expense control such as utilities. As anticipated, the remaining 70 basis points is explained by our private label credit card. The year-over-year expense reduction due to our contract re-negotiation will be more pronounced in the first half of the year than it will be in the back half of the year. We still believe that our general rule of thumb of approximately 13 basis points of expense de-leverage for every point of negative comp holds true for the year.  Moving to our operational metrics, during the quarter we opened five new stores and closed 41 Expo businesses for an ending store count of 2,238. At the end of the first quarter selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $273, down roughly 10.5%.  Now turning to the balance sheet, inventory remains a good news story. As you heard from Craig, at the end of the quarter retail inventory was $11.4 billion, down 9.6% from last year. On a per-store basis, inventory was down 8.8% to last year. Inventory turns were 3.9 times, flat to last year.  We ended the quarter with $43.8 billion in assets including $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2008 reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $2.3 billion offset by $172 million of capital expenditures and $381 million of dividends paid.  As a reminder, we have a $3.25 billion A2P2 commercial paper program that is 100% back stopped by a committed, long-term bank line of credit. As of the end of the first quarter we had no outstanding commercial paper.  We have approximately $11.4 billion of outstanding debt of which $1.8 billion comes due in the latter part of 2009. At this point it is our intent to repay the debt maturities as they come due using cash generated by the business.  Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, adjusted return on invested capital was approximately 11%. We are controlling what we can control. Our results in the first quarter were better than our plan but as Craig mentioned the external signals are mixed. We are comfortable with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. We are calling for fiscal 2009 sales down 9% with negative comps in the high single digit area, earnings per share from continuing operations down 7% and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations down 26%.  We continue to expect the first half to be softer than the back half of the year. We are holding our Investor conference on June 10 and look forward to covering our business in more detail with you at that time.  We thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. Operator, we are now ready for questions. \n :\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Scott Cicarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets. \nScott Cicarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Can you talk a little bit about some of the issues you ran into in Canada with the systems you mentioned and what that may mean for the U.S. system conversions and process conversions? \nFrank Blake:  Matt Carey is here and he will address that as well. I would say there are a couple of important learning\u2019s for us in the effort. The first is when you think about it, we really started this back in 2007 in the second half of 2007. For now almost two years that is what our Canadian team has been focused on. They have been focused on getting this basic system in place. At the same time, on the U.S. side Craig and his team with the IT team has been adding merchandising tools over that period of time. So when you look at the relative degree of control and sophistication on the tools what you actually see is all that effort focused on the foundational work you kind of lose some ground.  Second, as I said, these are big efforts. They dominate the mind share within the business. Again, it is something to be expected and a good learning for us that the business tends to focus on that implementation rather than some of the other issues coming at it. Again, we think we can work through it but it is cautionary as we think about the prospect of doing something like that more broadly in the company and certainly in the U.S. Matt do you want to make some comments? \nMatt Carey :  I would say two things. One is as you mentioned when you change the tool set out from underneath the business like we did with SAP you have a significant change management process you have to go through and a lot of folks to train. That is really one of the challenges that we are having right now. The second is when you implement a system this large at this scale you always have tuning and stability issues that you have to deal with. That is really what we are dealing with right now. The third thing I would say is we are going to continue to monitor the results of the SAP implementation in Canada but at the same time we are going to continue to enhance our tool set in the U.S. such that we can get benefits immediately for our business. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Michael Lasser - Barclays Capital. \nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: The spread between your U.S. comp and Lowe\u2019s comp widened a bit in the first quarter compared to where it was in the fourth quarter last year. That is despite an improvement in some of your customer satisfaction scores. Given that late last year you had some positive PR from the pricing changes you made and some advertising expenses from this quarter were pushed out do you think your share voice, your marketing message needs to be stronger in order to communicate to consumers they should come back into the stores? What is the philosophy there? \nFrank Blake :  A couple of comments on that. First, it is a fair comment on the advertising weight and the share of voice. We did some re-profiling in the quarter and pushed it out later and maybe that is some of the reflection in terms of our February results. So that is a possibility. The other thing I would comment on is we look at our business in its entirety. We have lots of different competitors. We have gained share overall in our market and as I said gained share in a number of our departments as Craig referenced. I think while our target is always to beat every competitor the other thing I would point out is sequentially quarter-over-quarter it is a better performance for us. \nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: One quick follow-up question to the comment you made Frank about seeing some experience in the west, particularly California, slip a little bit and the thought that it is tied to foreclosures, are you seeing anything specifically that would lead you to believe that the moratorium on foreclosures late last year led to some better results there? It would almost suggest that as long as people are staying in their house and not fearful of losing it they are spending a little bit on the property. \nFrank Blake :  I don\u2019t know on the moratorium. What I can say and it was kind of the reason for the cautionary flag in the comments was California is a hugely important market to us. It is a hugely important market within the country. What we saw, when we had this call in the fourth quarter we were kind of saying hey we think California is on an improving trend. That reversed for us in the first quarter of 2009 and one of the things we see and it is not unique to California, it is in other states, is where you see this accelerating rate of foreclosures you see pressure on comp performance. If you look at California for awhile it was getting better as they were working through the problem and now it has regressed. As I say, we just take that as a cautionary note. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies. \nDan Binder \u2013 Jefferies : Two part question. First, if you could quantify the April/March Easter shift impact on comps. The second part of the question was as it pertains to the type of expense leverage we can expect on credit in Q2 and how much of the expenses shifted out of Q1 into Q2? \nCarol Tome :  Let me give you the Easter answer first. Looking at U.S. comps, our reported comp was a negative 7.2% in March, negative 8% in April. Adjusting for Easter we were negative 8.7% in March and negative 7% in April. Then to answer your question about the benefit of our private label credit card, I think we have told you before we expect the year-over-year expense reduction to be about $250 million. We realized about $120 million of that in the first quarter so hopefully that helps with your model. I can just pick out for you the kind of expense de-leverage we experienced last year by quarter so that you can see that it is progressively easier.  We de-levered expenses in the first quarter last year by 96 basis points because of credit. The second quarter 73 basis points. In the third quarter 70 basis points and then in the fourth quarter 28 basis points. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Christopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: A follow-up on the expense question. First on the $250 million and the $120 million realized, that wasn\u2019t the advertising portion you referred to. I am curious how much of that is swinging out of 1Q and is it showing up in 2Q? Maybe you could help us on the math with the 13 basis point rule of thumb. You saw about 2 basis points per point in the first quarter. You have the 70 basis points in the second and third quarter on the credit side. Would this suggest that by the time you get to the fourth quarter you would be de-leveraging at more than 30 basis points per negative point of comp to arrive at 13 basis points for the year? \nCarol Tome :  Let me answer your first question first if I may. The private label card benefit of $250 million for the year, $120 million recognized in the first quarter, that is the private label credit card. We were $80 million under our expense plan. Some of that was timing and some of that was just better expense control candidly. I called out advertising as a timing matter. We will spend that. We were $10 million under our advertising plan in the first quarter. We will spend that in the second quarter. Hopefully that is helpful to you.  Looking at the second part of your question about how the quarter\u2019s progressed, our rule of thumb of 13 basis points is for the year. It gets increasingly worse as the quarters go on. Yes, in the fourth quarter we will have more expense de-leverage than the rule of thumb but for the year we think the rule of thumb holds true. \nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: One follow-up, if there is about 40 basis or $80 million under advertising and utilities, so what portion of that is utilities and how much of that do you think is sustainable? \nCarol Tome :  I called out two of the unders. We have a lot of unders. Utilities, to give you the exact dollar amount was $15 million under plan. A lot of that was usage actually. We got smarter about how to run utilities inside of our stores. So that is probably a permanent reduction. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Budd Bugatch - Raymond James. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: I was heartened to hear about the improvement in the logistics and RDC and the mechanized RDC. Can you talk about the time table? You have 600 stores operating, what is the time table? Is there any change in that? \nFrank Blake :  No there is no change in the timetable. We are planning to continue the roll out and expect to have it basically done by the end of next year. Mark Holifield is here, our head of supply chain. Mark if you want to give some more color around that? \nMark Holifield :  We are pleased with the performance of the overall supply chain and that includes our RDC\u2019s as many of them go through their first spring peak. The network is performing well. We feel good about our in-stock. Our inventory turns are logistics cost and most importantly the RDC\u2019s are serving the stores with timeliness, quality and accuracy of shipments.  In terms of the mechanization, while we are pleased with our performance in the non-mechanized facilities the mechanization is really just the next natural progression as we are in our accelerated supply chain evolution here. What we have implemented in Valdosta is industry standard technology. We have got some higher speed conveyer there. Some automated scanning and some automated labeling technology. The intent of this is to improve the accuracy and productivity even further. Based on what we have seen we are pleased with the initial results. So we will open a couple of more non-mechanized facilities while we learn about mechanization a bit more before we open the next mechanized facility. It is in our plan and it is just the next natural step of our supply chain evolution. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: The net promoter score growth was also pretty heartening. Is there any color you can add to that Frank in terms of regionality or measurement stats you are using or percentage that you are measuring? \nFrank Blake :  I guess the additional background I would give on that is we are very heartened by that and that is one number we think it is always hard on these customer survey data to exactly pin down your improvement. But that is a pretty good metric for improvement and I think it just has a lot to do with what Marvin and the store operations team are doing in terms of simplifying our focus and really focusing on the customer. Marvin is here. Marvin why don\u2019t you comment on that because I do think this customer first training that I referenced we have trained the entire company on is very important. We did that in the first quarter and it was a very important thing for us. \nMarvin Ellison:  We did a couple of things. We took an aggressive step to train every associate in the company including Mexico and China to support areas on customer service expectation by position. In the past we have made a general statement about the importance of service. This time we took it one step further with a learning team under HR and the operations team partnering together and by position we outlined specific priorities for each associate to serve customers. So the net promoter score increased as a direct result of this better engagement. Another data point I would give you is as you know we get over 100,000 voice or customer data points each and every week so we have a good data set. As a result of that, every division around the country, even some of these very, very densely populated, urban metro areas we are seeing engagement ratings over 9 in these locations and we have never seen that before. So we are going to continue to execute well. We are going to continue to staff around traffic levels. We are pleased with our progress thus far. So we are going to keep moving forward and keep enhancing what we are doing. \nOperator:  The next question comes from David Strasser \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott. \nDavid Strasser \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott: When you talked about the trends of the $900 and the trends of the $50, is that something that has changed a lot recently or has that sort of been the case as we have kind of seen this negative comp trend for the last eleven quarters or so? \nCraig Menear :  When you look at the transactions below $50 that actually has been an improving trend over the past few quarters. When you look at transactions in big ticket greater than $900 it is not improving. As a matter of fact it was slightly worse than it was in the fourth quarter. \nDavid Strasser \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott: Is that the way you are kind of modeling going forward? The continued trend that you just said? \nCraig Menear :  I think right now that is how we are viewing it. As the continued pressure is on big ticket and discretionary spend. \nDavid Strasser \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott: One quasi, not really a follow-up, but when you were doing all the shedding of assets and so on with Expo and Yard Birds and all that, where does China come into that thought process? Is that something you remain committed to or is that something you still kind of feel you can continue to focus even more on? \nFrank Blake :  I think as you look at China first it is our core business. These are stores we just had Annette Verschuren, our President in Asia over there with Bill [Lenny] who as Craig said is here now as our International SVP of Merchandising. These look like a Home Depot store. It is in our core business. I would also say we have had these stores for two years. We are still working on finding the right model that is a profitable model that we can then roll out across the country. We are not there for the sake of having 12 stores. We are there because we think there is a model to find and then roll out. That is really our focus. It is a little bit different from some of the other businesses. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Stephen Chick \u2013 FBR Capital Markets. \nStephen Chick \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: Two questions. The first one is maybe kind of two parts. Relative to sales, Carol or Frank can you just confirm the $221 million in liquidation Expo sales is actually excluded from the comp? Secondly related to sales, as we look into the second quarter I was wondering if you could speak to we cycle I think some tax rebate stimulus of a year ago and I know you are not giving quarterly guidance but should we think about the comp steadily and sequentially showing improvements from what you reported in the first quarter? Then I have a follow-up question on your California comments. \nCarol Tome :  I will confirm that the $221 million is excluded from the comp. As we look at the second quarter yes we do expect improvement and I will tell you that May is trending better than April. \nStephen Chick \u2013 FBR Capital Markets:  Is that trending better than April on an Easter adjusted basis I guess? So in the U.S. I think you had said; I\u2019m sorry, remind me what you said about April. April is down 7? \nCarol Tome :  On an Easter adjusted basis that is correct. Our trend is in line with our Easter adjusted and better than our reported. \nStephen Chick \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: Secondly, Frank your comments about California reversing trend or course there, by my calculation I think California the sales were down I think in the fourth quarter something like 9% and you had indicated in some of your comments back then you were seeing stabilization. They had comped better than the company average back then. Are they kind of in line with the company average is my first question? Second, with foreclosures can you talk about the dilemma of that being bad for the comp? Maybe the economy and housing but I don\u2019t want to say good but stimulating if you will with the renovation and the pent up activity that I would otherwise think might flow through a home improvement retailer if that makes any sense? \nFrank Blake :  The first part of your question right. California for the first quarter was worse than the company average. As I said, it was a reversal. We saw from an improving trend to a worsening trend and now it is worse than the company average. I will just give you the way we are thinking on the foreclosure side. The data that tracks foreclosures and whether they are accelerating or decelerating, when a house is actually sold out of foreclosure it gets out of that data set. On a positive side for our business obviously you see an up tick in transactions in some of these areas as houses get sold out of foreclosure but you have got sort of an overwhelming negative as more houses get put in as basically the data is saying. So you have a little bit of an up tick because you have some turnover increase and then some significant pressure as the acceleration of foreclosures go. \nCarol Tome :  If I can just jump in, there are 13 states in our country that have high density of foreclosures, seven of which we see the foreclosure rates accelerating and in those seven states our comp sales are worse.  \nOperator:  The next question comes from Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: With regard to the merchandising tools can you please provide us the percent in terms of the adoption rate by the buyers and also how should we think about gross margin benefit thus far and what additional opportunities are there in the future? \nFrank Blake :  On the tools, I would say the adoption rate is very good by the merchants. Our merchandising operations team and IT team actually have been working hand in hand with the merchants to develop these tools based on what they need. So it is almost a pull versus a push environment. We see that these tools are a piece of what is helping us drive the productivity at the same time that we are becoming more competitive in the market, lowering prices and it will be a key component for us in continuing to deliver the margin as we have projected for the year being slightly up year-over-year. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Frank [inaudible] for almost a year now. Can you please provide some color in the changes of your advertising is marketing since you joined? Are you doing anything differently in terms of reaching out to your credit card customers? \nFrank Blake :  First on the marketing side, a couple of changes I would say organizationally just to highlight one thing we have now marketing reporting into merchandising. So Frank reports to Craig which has I think improved significantly the coordination on our marketing side with our merchandising team. That is both due to an organizational change but also just the way Frank works. The second thing is you have seen a change in our tag line. I hope the spirit of the company I think is going to be better reflected and the culture of the company is going to be better reflected in our marketing and our advertising efforts going forward.  Craig I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on that as well? \nCraig Menear :  Part of our job as a merchandising team is to be the advocates for the customer and we are really focused on driving value and Frank and his team in marketing are really focused on doing a better job of communicating the value proposition of Home Depot. That is a big change. \nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: In terms of doing anything different with your credit card customers? \nCarol Tome :  We enjoy a robust CRM as a result of our credit card population. We do targeted mailings to them to invite them back into the store. Interestingly, we are seeing a shift in our private label credit card sales. We are down about 300 basis points from a penetration perspective year-over-year. I guess that is not surprising. I think most retailers are seeing a shift in credit. If you look at cash, check or debit card, anything that is cash equivalent, as the penetration of sales has increased from 36% last year to 39% this year. The year-over-year change is all in our private label credit card. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets. \nWayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets: Do you expect the 27 basis points of gross margin erosion quantified in the non-U.S. business to improve or worsen as the year progresses? What predictability do you have in that non-U.S. rate given the implementation of SAP and a longer term follow-up question for Frank and Craig. \nCarol Tome :  We saw margin improvement in Canada in the month of April and the good news about the SAP implementation is we get to see margin every day. So now we are in to May and we continue to see improvement. The year-over-year noise that we have been experiencing both in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year is going to abate. The guidance we have given for gross margin for the total company of flat to slightly positive for the year holds true. \nWayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets: Frank or Craig or both of you, I guess as I look back at the industry over the last 10-15 years we have put on a lot of square footage, bigger stores, more vignettes to kind of go after the bigger ticket business as it kind of grew. I was just wondering have you given any thought to maybe secular changes that are afoot here with respect to big ticket purchases and any recovery we have may be longer and more prolonged and if it is longer and more prolonged are we sitting there with a store base that is so big it needs to be recalibrated for slower rates in big ticket to kind of improve returns over the long-term? If so, how do you recalibrate it? \nFrank Blake :  Certainly we have recalibrated to the extent of saying new store growth is not our principle activity and our principle use of capital. Your comment is reflected at the broadest strategic level in the company in terms of how we are allocating capital. Within the store, you see some shifts in terms of how we allocate bays but that is more incremental and evolutionary. Is that helpful? \nWayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets: I think we all understood the new store and why you backed it down but I\u2019m just thinking the existing square footage that is still out there with expanded vignettes that if that business doesn\u2019t come back beyond the payroll how do you reallocate that square footage to make it more productive, to get returns moving again in the right direction? \nFrank Blake :  Again, I don\u2019t think on that side and I will let Craig comment as well, that we see a need to dramatically remodel our stores in any way. We feel pretty comfortable with the space that we have allocated to each part of our business. There will be, as you suggest and we have actually done that on the store operations team under Marvin\u2019s leadership, there is adjustment on labor hours in the store as an example. So you shift some hours away from some of the specialty, higher ticket activity to some of the more every day repair activity. At least right now for us it has much more of a labor impact and how we apply our associates than it does on any big changes in store structure. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: I was wondering why the focus on gross margin? First in the U.S. the 29 basis points is a pretty good performance here. Carol can you break that down just in terms of the benefit from the things you mentioned; shrink, mix and commodity benefit? Then also just comment more broadly on any positive or negative around the promotional environment and mark downs? That is part-one focusing on the U.S. margin. Part two of the gross margin question, I still don\u2019t in all fairness have really any understanding of what exactly happened to cause the gross margin pressure in Canada. Did the system buy too much inventory? Did you have mark downs? Was there out of stock? What exactly went wrong there that caused the gross margin pressure in Canada? \nCarol Tome :  Let\u2019s start with the first part of your question. In the U.S. up 29 basis points, shrink added 9 basis points or contributed 9 basis points of that 29 basis points. The remainder was driven primarily by a shift in mix. We had a lower penetration of lumber. Lumber is one of our lowest margin categories so that helped. We had a lower penetration of appliances and appliances is one of our lower margin categories so that helped. We had a higher penetration of paint and paint is one of our higher margin categories so that helped. Most of that 20 basis points is due to a mix in penetration. \nFrank Blake :  On Canada what I would say is again is let me put this in two comments. My first comment, take an overall comment that you have a team that is very focused on implementing a very big process change with all the cultural change that Matt described. That is the one bucket. In the other bucket you have an economy that is starting to reflect the same pain as in the U.S. and on top of that a currency issue where the Canadian currency is devaluing. So that is the big backdrop.  Underneath that you then look at okay what is your cost and price change process, what are your forecasting tools, what is the visibility you have through the system into those and what you get is maybe in part a reaction time that is slower than it might have otherwise been and in part reaction that is not fully addressing the issue that you have got. So I would say it is a combination of your focus gets taken off a little bit and then the tools are unfamiliar tools and you are not exactly sure how to work through with these new tools to get the desired result.  As Carol said, we feel a lot better on where that is going. I think we all acknowledge these are big activities to take on. This isn\u2019t a kind of wheels off issue. It was a couple of things didn\u2019t go just as perfectly as we would like to see them go. Is that helpful? \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein:  Yes. I will follow-up afterwards. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: First of all, can you talk about how the big ticket trend versus the small ticket trend if you will relates to the strength in any given market? In other words, in those markets which are recovering or are stronger for you in absolute terms are you seeing big ticket act better in relation to the broader mix than you are in markets that are weaker? \nCraig Menear :  If you look at areas of the country where housing overall has been more stable from the very beginning, less speculative if you will, big ticket has done slightly better in those markets. If you look at areas like California where it has been difficult, the big ticket construction and discretionary categories are still running significant double digit negatives. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Have those turned the corner at all? I guess there could be two kinds of sales improvement. There could be sort of traffic driven whether it is driven by seasonal outdoor or a revival of smaller ticket, less project oriented purchases or there could be what could be a slower but more significant turn which would be the big ticket business getting less bad as well. Are you seeing that happening? \nCraig Menear :  At this point in time the big ticket and for example on the west coast we are not seeing a significant change in terms of improvement. As a matter of fact, it actually got a little more difficult from the fourth quarter as Frank had mentioned earlier. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Just a follow-up question on appliances. You haven\u2019t addressed it that explicitly but it sort of came up in an answer to a couple of questions ago that somewhat lower appliance mix I believe you said contributed to the gross margin improvement. I also know that had been a [footholed] category in the fourth quarter. Promotionally just any update on what you are seeing there? Also related to that whether you see any kind of strategic vendor opportunities during this downturn in that space? \nCraig Menear :  Appliances overall I think have remained relatively promotional. It is a product category that historically is driven off promotion. We see that continue for sure. As far as supplier, I really don\u2019t see anything significant. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Co. \nLaura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Co. : I was hoping you could drill down a little more into share gains. I think you mentioned 7 out of 13 categories. What generally is driving share gains and what is your outlook for that going forward? \nFrank Blake :  From a share standpoint overall the things that are driving are aligned structure improvements so overall assortment improvements, utilizing our merchandising tools to get below market level and sorting more at a store level. We have used our portfolio strategy to focus in key areas in driving the right value proposition for our customer as well. Quite frankly these are things that we continue to focus on as we continue to learn and educate our merchants on the use of the tools and we expect that to continue in terms of the improvement in share. \nDiane Dayhoff:  I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. \nOperator:  Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Beginning today's discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning to everyone. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and Carol Tome, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up, please. This conference call is being broadcast real time on the Internet at earnings.homedepot.com. The replay will also be available on our site. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations Department at (770) 384-2387. Now before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided in the financial statements included with our earnings release. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrancis Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $15.1 billion, up 3.8% from last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.36. As Carol will detail, fourth quarter comp sales were positive, 3.9% for the company and 4.8% for the U.S. We saw strength across the U.S. as 49 of 50 states positively comped. The states that have been the most impacted by the housing crisis, specifically Florida and California, performed in line with the company's overall performance in the U.S. So while they're not leading us out of the downturn, they are at least no longer an anchor. The markets with under performance to the company average in the fourth quarter tended to be those with significant weather impacts during the quarter and particularly January, such as in the Northeast. Last quarter, we mentioned that we were seeing a tighter range of performance across our top markets. That continued to be the case in the fourth quarter. So the overall picture is one of a stabilizing business. This is a source of some confidence for 2011 because it's occurring despite the continued weakness of the housing markets. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP remained near its 60-year low at 2.25%. We still look at this measure to help understand the pressures in the housing market and the fact that our performance has disconnected from it suggests that our business is stabilizing and can improve even as the housing market remains under stress. Operationally, we continue to make progress with our customer service initiatives. We've completed the rollout of our First Phone. And Marvin Ellison and his team ended the year with 51% of store payroll allocated to customer-facing activities. Since we've started measuring our labor allocation, this is the first time we've crossed the threshold of having more hours dedicated to customer-facing activity than tasking activity. We have a target of a 60:40 ratio and we believe we'll achieve that by 2013. As we drive this re-allocation, we are seeing ongoing improvement in our Net Promoter Score, which is up 450 basis points year-over-year and is now over 73%. We achieved another significant milestone in the fourth quarter. We opened our 19th Rapid Deployment Center. This completes our RDC buildout, at least for the next several years. Restructuring the supply chain of a business as large as Home Depot in just three years is an enormous undertaking that touched almost every part of the company and required the work and dedication of the entire team, but Mark Holifield and his supply chain team merit particular recognition. We now have ahead of us continued opportunities to improve the RDCs themselves, as well as the rest of the supply chain, particularly our stocking facilities. For the quarter, as Craig will detail, we had a very successful holiday selling season. We saw a continued growth in transactions, and we also saw an uptick in our average ticket, with strong performance in kitchens and appliances. Over the course of 2010, we made significant improvements in our merchandising systems, predominantly focused on our in-stock product and processes. For 2011, that will continue, but we will also intensify our focus on our special order product and processes. This has been an area of historic underperformance for the company. We know we have to make it easier for our customers to buy non-stock items, and Matt Carey and his IT team along with our dot com merchandising [ph] and operational teams will be making this a priority. We will be digitizing our catalogs, upgrading our special order systems within our stores, restructuring our SKUs to accommodate shopping for coordinated items and continuing to improve the connectivity between our digital presence and our bricks-and-mortar presence. On the international side of our business, Mexico continues to perform well, with positive comps for the 29th quarter in a row. Canada had negative comps for the quarter, as they lapped last year's dramatic increase in sales, driven by the expiration of the Home Renovation Tax Credit. In 2011, our U.S. businesses will be lapping the expiration of a series of 2010 tax incentives: the new homeowner tax credit, the Cash for Clunkers appliance credit and the $1,500 energy tax credit. But we believe the growth in GDP and improving consumer sentiment will continue to lift our business in 2011. For the year, we are anticipating approximately 2.5% sales growth and 9.5% growth in earnings per share. We have some difficult comparisons in the first quarter, but we expect each quarter to show positive growth, with sales momentum gaining in the back half. We continue to focus on disciplined capital allocation and increasing shareholder return, as we have laid out for you in the past. And our intent is to increase our dividend every year. So today, the Board of Directors and I are pleased to announce that we are increasing the quarterly dividend, 6% to $0.25. We will continue to use excess cash to repurchase our shares. The hard work and dedication of our associates will make the difference in 2011 as they did in 2010. We're very proud that 93% of our stores qualified for success sharing for the back half of 2010. And now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our fourth quarter results, we are pleased that the focus areas we shared with you on our last earnings call met or exceeded our expectations during the quarter. We saw excellent results from our gift centers, seasonal and Black Friday offerings and new product launches. The fourth quarter represented our fifth quarter in a row of positive comp growth. We saw positive comps in nine departments during the quarter, and we were pleased with the comp improvement we saw in the U.S. from the third to the fourth quarter. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were kitchens, outdoor garden, indoor garden, electrical and tools. As I mentioned going into the fourth quarter, we leaned into the holiday season and increased our buys. The outstanding values in our gift centers, as well as our incredible Black Friday line-up, led to a very strong November. In fact, the tremendous response by our customers to our Appliance values led to double-digit positive comps for Appliances in the month of November. The expiration of a tax credit in the U.S., for the purchase of energy-efficient windows, doors, skylights, drove increased sales in Millwork and home services during the first two months of the quarter as customers made purchases ahead of December's 31 deadline. We also saw a continued strength in our gift centers and our decorative holiday categories throughout the month of December. While January was impacted by heavy snow and ice, we are well positioned to respond in weather-related categories. Our teams executed extremely well, leveraging our supply chain capabilities to position product for our customers. As a result, we saw a double-digit positive comps in Power Snow Removal Equipment, chemicals and Snow Tool categories. As we shared with you previously, our focus over the past few years has been to restore the competitive position of Home Depot and to drive everyday great values for our customers. As a result of this effort, we have seen improved customer transactions for the past five quarters, and our overall company comp transactions were up 1.3% in the fourth quarter. Total company average ticket was up 2.6% or $1.30 to $51.31 for the quarter. Transactions for tickets under $50, roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., were up 1.8% year-over-year. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, also approximately 20% of the U.S. sales, were up 9.6% in the fourth quarter certainly contributing to our overall company ticket performance. Drivers of this big-ticket increase included the sales of Appliances, Millwork, Windows and HVAC. While customers responded to the great values we offered in the quarter and took advantage of tax credits, we believe they still remain cautious on making big-ticket investments in their homes. During the fourth quarter, we saw some commodity price inflation. In the last 45 days, we have seen a number of requests from vendors for price increases as a result of elevated raw material costs. We review each of these requests on an individual basis, and our portfolio strategy drives our go-to-market actions as it has done for the past several years. The ongoing development of our assortment and value offerings for our customers through the implementation of our merchandising transformation continues to pay off through market share growth. As of December, according to the NAICS 4441 U.S. Census data, we gained 19 basis points of market share on a rolling 12-month basis. Additionally, based on an independent third party tracking of consumer activity, we gained unit share in seven out of 13 departments during the fourth quarter, including building materials, tools and hardware, plumbing, electrical, indoor garden, outdoor garden and appliances. As we've look to 2011, we are well positioned to drive both sales and transactions. We kicked off the new year with great values on several interior projects, including bath remodels and paint. We are currently offering round two of our outstanding event called Vanity Insanity, and we are seeing terrific project selling from our associates, as well as great overall results from the event. In our paint category, we're excited about the fact that a third-party leading consumer publication recently ranked our BEHR Premium Plus Ultra paint as its best buy across all dominant sheens for the second year in a row. Our BEHR Premium Plus and Glidden brands were also ranked highly across all sheens, reinforcing the fact that we have an incredibly strong offering for our customers in the DIY paint space. We also continue to focus on innovation and services for our professional customers. At the most recent builder's show in January, BEHR announced the introduction of KILZ PRO-X, a product line designed with a professional paint contractor in mind to be available exclusively at all Home Depot stores by the end of the first quarter of 2011. The entire KILZ PRO-X line has been formulated to optimize spray, roll and brush application, along with performance features, including superior hide and coverage and touch-up capabilities, allowing our professional painters to save time and money. As we roll out KILZ PRO-X, we are also implementing new POS enhancements that allow us to better serve this customer segment. In addition, we are rolling out a new line of Milwaukee Red Lithium tools powered by the leading lithium technology available. These tools deliver 40% longer run time and 20% more torque than products powered by current lithium technology, in addition to providing superior performance in cold weather conditions. And finally, we have a lineup of some incredible special buys and innovative new products for our outdoor categories during the 2011 spring selling season. We will kick off the spring season with an outstanding Spring Black Friday event. Spring Black Friday will include some of our most popular outdoor categories, such as live goods, lawn care, outdoor power, eco-friendly gardening products, patio and grills. And in addition to our Spring Black Friday event, we'll also be introducing several great products for our customers' outdoor projects, such as Armor Guard decking, an expansion of our green garden chemical products by both BEHR and Ortho, a new lineup of tractors from John Deere, and continuing innovation in cordless garden tools building on the benefits of lithium technology. We're excited about these new product rollouts for 2011, and we feel confident that our customers will recognize and respond to the great values being offered at The Home Depot this spring. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. We exceeded the guidance we gave you at the beginning of December due to stronger-than-anticipated sales growth and a couple of expense goodbyes. In the fourth quarter, sales were $15.1 billion, a 3.8% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 3.9% for the quarter, with positive comps of 7.5% in November, positive 5.1% in December and negative 0.7% in January. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 4.8% for the quarter, with positive comps of 8% in November, positive 5.8% in December and positive 0.7% in January. For the year, our sales increased 2.8% to $68 billion. Total company comp sales were positive 2.9% for fiscal 2010, and comps for U.S. stores were positive 2.5%. Our gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 25 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business contributed 24 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, principally because we had lower levels of clearance inventory in our stores. Clearance inventory is down 32% from one year ago, and our inventory has never been in better shape. For the year, we experienced 40 basis points of gross margin expansion. Turning to operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 161 basis points to 27.8%, and total operating expense dollars were $80 million less than last year. Our expense leverage was primarily the result of positive same-store sales, but also reflects the following significant items. First, depreciation expense was $18 million under last year due to a lower asset base arising from fully depreciated assets. Second, we saw a $24 million year-over-year expense benefit due to a lower-than-anticipated cost of private label credit. And third, management bonuses were $34 million less than last year. Relative to our financial plan, we had a good year but not as good as what we experienced in 2009. Finally, we did incur some expense associated with the announcement of six-store closings in the quarter. But that expense was about the same as the expense we incurred last year for similar actions. For fiscal 2010, operating expenses as a percent of sales was 25.7%, a decrease of 93 basis points from last year. As detailed in our press release, we had some charges associated with HD Supply and our business rationalization in 2009 and 2010. Adjusting for those charges, we leveraged operating expenses by 75 basis points for the year. As we discussed, we've experienced great expense control due to the introduction of new tool. During the year, we also recognized some one-time expense benefits, totaling about $70 million that we do not believe will repeat in 2011. In the fourth quarter, interest and other expense was $87 million. On an adjusted basis, interest was down $71 million from last year due primarily to the following factors: First, we had an unexpected $44 million benefit related to favorable IRS guidance and the corresponding reversal of an interest accrual; second, the cost of outstanding indebtedness was lower than last year; and third, we had some interest benefit arising from certain state tax settlement. For the year, interest and other expense totaled $566 million. Our income tax provision rate was 38.2% in the fourth quarter and 36.7% for the year. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $0.36, an increase of 100% from last year. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 50%. For the year, earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.01, up 29.7% from fiscal 2009. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 22.3% to $2.03 compared to last year's adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.66. Now moving to our operational metrics. During the fourth quarter, we opened five new stores and closed one store in China for an ending store count of 2,248. At the end of the year, selling square footage was 235 million, flat to last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the fourth quarter were $255, up 4.3% from last year. For fiscal 2010, sales per square foot were $289, up 3.5% from fiscal 2009. Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, inventory was $10.6 billion, up $437 million from a year ago. This reflects higher sales level, as well as a pull forward of certain spring inventory buys. Inventory turns were 4.13x, up from 4.06x last year. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $600 million or 17.6 million shares of outstanding stock. We ended the year with $40.1 billion in assets, including $545 million in cash. For the year, this reflects cash generated by the business of approximately $4.4 billion, offset by $2.6 billion used for share repurchases, $1.6 billion used for dividends and $1.1 billion of capital expenditures. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 12.8%, 213 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Now as we look to 2011, we expect another year of sales growth, in line with the U.S. GDP growth expectations. We detailed our guidance in our press release, so let me just hit the high points. First, let me remind you that we guide off of GAAP. For the year, we project that our sales will increase by approximately 2.5%, with low single-digit same-store sales growth. We plan to open 10 stores in 2011, two in the U.S., one in Canada and seven in Mexico. We expect sales growth to be stronger in the second half than in the first half of the year, with growth rates fairly similar to what we reported in the U.S. for fiscal 2010. We are planning positive same-store sales growth in every quarter, but we expect the first quarter to be our lowest comping quarter, given the timing of spring's arrival last year and tough year-over-year commodity price comparisons. For fiscal 2011, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations to increase by approximately 9.5% to $2.20. Included in our earnings per share guidance is operating margin expansion of approximately 40 basis points, arising from gross margin expansion and modest expense leverage. As I mentioned at our December investor conference, we expect some discrete cost pressures in 2011, and we have some operating expense benefit in 2010 that won't repeat. So we anticipate operating expenses will grow at approximately 70% of our sales growth rate for the year. Given year-over-year expense comparison, we project that our earnings growth will be stronger in the first half of the year than in the back half of the year. For fiscal 2011, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $5.7 billion. This forecast assumes we refinance $1 billion of senior notes that come due in March. We will use our cash to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. Our 2011 capital spending plan is $1.35 billion, reflecting $585 million for our existing U.S. stores and supply chain, $370 million for IT, $300 million for new stores and $95 million for our non-U.S. businesses. We just announced a 6% increase in our annual cash dividend to $1 per share, and we'll use cash to fund our dividend, which for the year approximate $1.6 billion. This leaves approximately $2.5 billion of excess cash, which we intend to use for share repurchases. Depending on the timing of our repurchases, we should see some earnings per share benefit arising from this activity in 2011. Assuming we repurchase the shares ratably over the course of 2011, we expect our earnings per share growth from continuing operations to be approximately 12% for the year. So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And Cindy, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: I wanted to ask the first question about weather. In your prepared comments, you addressed the weather in January and we've heard from a lot of other retailers talking about weather, and you gave us the progression of comps through the quarter. So I guess the question I have is as you look at the weather in the markets, was it overall positive or negative? And then to what extent other way?\nFrancis Blake: Well, so if you went through the monthly comps that Carol set out, for the months with strong positive comps, November and December, I wouldn't say that, that was because of weather. Or unless you want to put it -- well, there wasn't weather that stopped people from being able to get to the stores. I mean that was really the weather issue in January was I mean, for example, here in Atlanta, I mean the city was shut down for almost a week. So I'd say if you look at it from that perspective, weather was more of a negative for us.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And the second question I had with respect to the ticket information you gave in the press release. We saw a nice uptick there, and again if my math is correct, it looks like one of the strongest growth in ticket in a few years. As you look at that, you think that was more reflective of something particular fourth quarter? Or was that something that's more reflective of an underlying trend in the business as something we could carry forward as we look into 2011?\nFrancis Blake: The key drivers of ticket in the quarter were obviously growth in categories like Millwork, HVAC, some of the categories that actually benefited from the tax credit, as well as a terrific response from our customers on our appliance offerings that we had as part of our Black Friday event, and a follow-up performance in our kitchen business overall.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: As we built our plan for 2011, we assumed more growth would come from transactions in the first half of the year and more from ticket in the back half of the year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.\nPeter Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Craig, you mentioned kind of some of your plans for the spring, specifically interested in the outdoor power equipment category. How do you plan that category going forward, the riding mowers? And what are your forecasts telling you in terms of the timing of spring, because I think spring was real early last year. When do you guys expect that to kind of set in?\nCraig Menear: Peter, we did have an early spring last year, which was a very nice benefit in Q1. I think this year, if you buy into the forecasts it's more of a normalized spring this year. And so we actually anticipate that it provides a little bit of headwind in the first quarter. And then we're excited about our overall outdoor power equipment lineup for this year, excited about the value propositions that we have in Riding Mowers and Walk Behind Mowers. We have an outstanding program in walks. And then as I mentioned, we're expanding with some new product in outdoor power as it relates to continued expansion of lithium, which did very well for us last year. So looking forward to the spring selling season.\nPeter Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: And one quick follow-up. On the international comp trend, when should we expect kind of a turnaround and particularly in Canada? Are you guys expecting that to be positive next year? And if so, when do you expect that swing?\nFrancis Blake: Yes, Canada, so we continue to have a little bit of headwind in the first quarter just as you get through all of the tax credit compares and then it should start to turn positive.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Schick at Stifel, Nicolaus.\nDavid Schick: Frank, you said at the beginning of the call excess cash to buy back shares. Carol you said priorities are to return cash and invest in the business. But just I guess more details on your thoughts if you beat guidance, how do you think about movements on the balance sheet, buyback, the dividend? What are the priorities that you would use excess operating income for?\nFrancis Blake: Well, hopefully, we've set out our guiding principles pretty clearly over time which is, first, we invest in the business to support and sustain our company; and then second, we do look to excess cash for buying back shares. And we have an objective of increasing our dividends annually as we approach a payout ratio of 40%-ish. And we're kind of slowly, as you saw from the announcement this morning, we're kind of trending down in that direction.\nDavid Schick: So it's not one big next thing, if you would continue the balance of things?\nFrancis Blake: Right.\nDavid Schick: And then just any comment on what you're seeing in the rollout of the First Phone?\nFrancis Blake: Well, Marvin's here and I'd ask Marvin to comment on this. I'd just say at the start that it's really been a program just extraordinarily well received by our associates and a great job both by our operations team and our IT team. But Marvin?\nMarvin Ellison: Yes David, very successful. We had really a couple of key things we're focused on. Number one, simplifying how we look at data. This device gives the associate real-time data on sales, gross margin and inventory. Also in-stock; simplifies the in-stock process, which is big for us. But one thing that's been a pleasant surprise is checkout. We had almost 1 million transactions in the fourth quarter on the First Phone in checking customers out at point-of-sale. So a mobile point-of-sale checkout is a big for us because we have a huge focus this year on speed of checkout. And the results and the feedback have been terrific. A great partnership between Matt Carey and his team, Marc Powers, my lead of operations. And we feel like that we have a lot to build on for the rest of the year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Horvers at JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Can you talk about your thought process on bringing the inventory in a bit earlier this year for spring? I think you made that same decision a year ago, and it was very successful. Just curious what the drivers were this year.\nCraig Menear: Yes, we did have success with that last year. You are correct. And so we're following on that success. Given all the data that we looked at, we said we wanted to be prepared to capture anything early that we could, given the fact that the projections right now for the later part of the quarter are not all that strong from a weather standpoint. Who knows how that will exactly play out, but that's the decision that we made.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And Carol, on the gross margin, did you see any pressure in 4Q related to commodity cost pressures? And are you baking in any for 2011?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, as you can appreciate in the gross margin, there were lots of goes in and goes out related to product mix, and there was some inflation in there as well but nothing material or else we would have called it out. As we build our plan for 2011, it is a commodity neutral plan. Craig mentioned in his comments that over the past 45 days, we've been getting some requests for price increases and we deal with those, one request at a time.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser at Barclays Capital.\nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: So there's been a lot of noise in the housing market over the last year. And as you look into the category detail of your recent performance, is there anything to suggest that the strong fourth quarter results weren't just due to the upturn in the housing turnover that occurred early in 2010, especially in light of the historical six- to nine-month lag between that metric and home improvement demand?\nFrancis Blake: Michael, we can't see it. I mean it's an interesting question because you might think you saw just as you said, you saw this spike kind of in the spring and was that coming through more in the fourth quarter. But if you look at where the strength was, I think you'd say it was a combination of areas where we had great offerings and took some share and other areas where you had improvement through the tax credit items that we called out. And then a very, very strong seasonal, holiday season selling that we really don't think was related to a uptick in the housing market as a whole.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: To put it in perspective, the benefit we enjoyed from the sale of energy-related products was about 50 basis points impact to our comp in the quarter.\nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital: Follow question. Consumers have shown a clear desire to want to re-engage in home improvement over the last few quarters. So the next big headwind the business might face is pressure on discretionary budgets from rising food and gas prices. Does that influence how you think about the portfolio pricing strategy as we move through the spring and through the rest of this year?\nCraig Menear: Yes, I mean, and certainly, we know that if you look over the past couple of years, there's been cycles where the customer has been under serious pressure with discretionary spend. That's why we are incredibly focused on trying to drive great values for our customers every day and focusing on making sure that we're putting the offerings out there that continues to drive our positive comp transactions and really helps drive customers to our stores. So it's a key focus for us as we move forward.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Bernstein Research: First question, just back on gross margin. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you'll probably get a few more requests from vendors for price increases over the next 45 and probably 400 days. How do you think about passing that through? In what categories do you think you have some pricing power? And which categories might you need to be a little bit more careful? And historically, what have you seen and how do you think this might be similar or different?\nCraig Menear: Colin look I would agree there is certainly been pressure in the last 45 days. I don't think that's going to subside. But we deal with those on an individual, one-off basis. Our first and foremost approach is try to figure out how to work with our suppliers to either leverage our supply chain, leverage how we do business together to try to mitigate the pressure that they're seeing so that we can continue to hold the line the best we can. And really, in terms of our go-to-market approach, that's driven by our portfolio strategy. And we are guided by our portfolio strategy in terms of how we think about applying pressure in the marketplace and what we really want to stand for.\nColin McGranahan - Bernstein Research: And then just separate follow-up question, I know it's hard to do, but is there any way you can quantify what you think the impact of the energy tax credit in the appliance -- your strong performance in appliances in November did to the comp in November?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, we can tail you for the quarter what we think it is.\nColin McGranahan - Bernstein Research: That\u2019d be fine.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: So we think the impact of energy was about 50 basis points to the U.S. and appliances was about 120-ish basis points.\nColin McGranahan - Bernstein Research: And Carol, just a follow up on that. Given your expectation that comps improve through the year, should we -- your toughest compare now is the fourth quarter, would we assume that you'll do something similar in the appliance category next year? Will this become kind of an annual event?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We're not going to share our secrets with you today.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Laura Champine at Cowen and Company.\nLaura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC: We're very pleased to see the increase in big-ticket purchases, and it looks like you gained some share there. But Craig, you made a statement that you thought the consumer was still cautious on big ticket. What's your evidence there? And what's the outlook for the bigger ticket spending in 2011?\nCraig Menear: Well, I think two things. Number one, when you look at the categories that had positive growth that were tied to the tax credits, so we look at that and go, that's not necessarily repeating. So that makes us a little bit cautious as a result. And then the second piece of it is we still need to see improvement in the big projects with the customers; it\u2019s not seeing a lot of evidence of major remodels going on in homes at this point. So that's really the two things that we're looking at from a caution standpoint.\nLaura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC: And then just a clarification on the last answer. The 120 basis point impact on Q4 from appliances, was that from your own promotions or from stimulus programs for ENERGY STAR appliances?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: That was the impact of appliance sales\u2026\nCraig Menear: Sales, right.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: In the quarter.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.\nWayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So, my question was to Craig and I guess you are sitting at record gross margin levels from where we are today and over the next 12 months. Are we at an inflection point where you begin to give some consideration to reinvesting more into price in areas like Appliances to drive growth in market share and let your gross margins kind of flatten out in '12 and '13? And instead of having modest increases, maybe it's slight.\nCraig Menear: So as it relates to our strategy first and foremost, what we're trying to do is continue to lower prices for our customers on a day-in-day-out basis and drive greater value for them. And we're trying to manage obviously the bottom line by driving improved efficiencies in how we run the business. So things like the 32% reduction in clearance inventory, which saves the margin line obviously or how we've been able to deliver the improvement to date and still be able to lower prices for our customers. And that's our continued focus. We shared at our analyst meeting that as we moved into 2011 we'll begin to see benefit from our supply chain and much less of it comes from our merchandising.\nWayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just a follow-up for you too, Craig, is where do you think your inventory will be by the end of the second quarter and the end of the year? And then Carol, where are you thinking the payables to inventory would be for the year just so we can take a look at your cash flow?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, why don't we put it in terms, if I could jump in, Craig, put it in terms of net working capital, so that would be receivables, inventory and payables. As of the end of 2010, net working capital as a percent of sales was 10.3%, and we project based on the guidance that we've shared with you this morning that it will drop to 9.8% by the end of 2011.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Greg Melich at International Strategy Investment.\nGregory Melich - ISI Group Inc.: I wanted to get into the SG&A a little bit more in the earnings progression. I think you've mentioned that first half earnings growth should be better than second half, given some of the comparisons on SG&A. Yet the comps will be weaker in the first half than the second half. Could you take us through the logic behind that? What's driving it? And also, do you have the Durbin Amendment and the benefits in your guidance for this year?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, absolutely. Well, as I mentioned, we have about $70 million of expense benefit that we don't believe will repeat in 2011. That expense benefit took place in the back half of 2010. You'll recall in the third quarter, we told you that we had $20 million of gains from real estate sales. We don't believe we'll have those gains next year. In the fourth quarter, we just called out a $24 million year-over-year benefit related to our private label credit. The gross benefit was $44 million. That won't repeat next year. So that takes us to $64 million of expense benefit that won't repeat and then there was about $6 million of other items that won't repeat. And all of that took place in the back half of the year. So that's why the year-over-year earnings is different than the year-over-year sales growth estimate. On the Durbin side, as you know, the Durbin Amendment asked the Federal Reserve to determine what reasonable and proportionate fees should be for debit, and debit makes up about 17% of our tender penetration. Based on the Fed's draft regulation, we think the benefit to The Home Depot could be $35 million a year. Now because it hasn't been implemented, clearly the benefit to us would be less than $35 million in 2011. And because we don't know when it's going to be implemented, we haven't put any of that in our plan.\nGregory Melich - ISI Group Inc.: And then if I could follow up on commodity inflation. You said that that's a neutral environment in your gross margins. But what did commodity inflation actually impact comp in the fourth quarter? And what do you expect in the top line for commodities this year?\nCraig Menear: So between lumber and copper in the quarter, it was approximately 50 basis points of impact.\nGregory Melich - ISI Group Inc.: And in the guidance for this year?\nCraig Menear: We basically plan for flat.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steve Chick at FBR Capital Markets.\nStephen Chick - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: I guess question on weather and kind of with the storms we've seen and the commentary you made about January, is there a way to, I guess, plan or assess what the restoration might be if you might get a benefit of that in terms of recovering in restoration? And have you seen any kind of pick up as you move beyond January and I guess you could say thawed out or gotten further into February here?\nCraig Menear: Steve, this is Craig. I really don't have a way to quantify it. There's no way for us to do that. But what I can tell you is that we certainly believe that folks will have to repair things. When you look at the amount of ice and snow that existed, you'll have roof damage, you'll have live good damage in terms of shrubs, bushes. Their gutters will need to be replaced. So we're certainly prepared for that and anticipate that.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And as we look at our business in February, the first couple of weeks of February, the weather was horrible. But it's gotten better. And February comps are running better than our January comps.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alan Rifkin at Bank of America.\nAlan Rifkin - BofA Merrill Lynch: Frank, with big ticket up so strong and obviously a significant contributor to comps, could you maybe shed some color on how good of a leading indicator you believe big-ticket strength is in other parts of your business, even including repair and maintenance?\nCraig Menear: Well, so let me start with the repair and maintenance. Again, and we've shared on past calls that, that has been a strength in our business, and certainly repair and maintenance categories continued to perform positively. So the customer is still focused there. As we look at the big ticket, particularly around the fourth quarter, certainly the drivers behind that, again where the great values that we had in our appliance offerings, it's a good appliance time in the industry in total and we kind of went after that with some great values and did very well. But then, you look at the categories that were impacted by tax credits, and those performed extremely well. And certainly, that environment obviously has now changed. So we think that, that adds some pressure going forward and don't really anticipate the same level of big-ticket performance as we move through the first half of the year.\nAlan Rifkin - BofA Merrill Lynch: And one follow-up, if I may. With the RDC program completed last month, can you maybe just give us an update on what you think the gross margin benefits will be, as well as the benefits to turns? And would it be unreasonable to expect that 2011 should be the year where you realize the maximum benefits from the RDC rollout now that the expenses are behind you?\nFrancis Blake: So Alan, I wouldn't say that it's the year of maximum benefit, but it is the year it starts to turn to a benefit as we've been describing this all along. There's an investment and then the benefit starts to come forward. And as we talked about it in December, we saw overall 40 basis points with 30 coming from the supply chain and the RDCs as it picks up. And you start to see that benefit as we go forward in 2011.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Deborah Weinswig at Citigroup.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: Carol, you mentioned great expense control due to some new tools. I'm pretty well versed on your merchandising tools, but can you please expand on the tool that helped deliver the company's great expense results in the quarter. And what inning are we on, on these tools?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, I think we've talked in the past about our new checkbook that we introduced in the stores. That really helped the stores manage their operating expenses like their personal bank account. And they have great visibility now when they can actually pull up images of invoices. It's just really helping them get their arms around our expenses. We also have cost-out teams here at the store support center, and these teams go aggressively against cost. We do a lot of cohort analysis. Just superior analytics helping us really getting underneath the cost. There's a sense of enthusiasm. We're really enthusiastic about sales, but there's a real sense of enthusiasm about cost control, too. And we recognize people who drive out costs. You might say, \u201cAre you done?\u201d We're not done if you think about the expense plan that we put together for 2011, expenses would be going faster if we didn't have expense control in place. So we still got opportunities to drive productivity in our business for sure. And a lot of that is coming from the technology initiatives that Matt and his team are driving in our business. With technology boy, lots of cost can go out.\nMarvin Ellison: So Deborah, let me give you a perspective on the P&L checkbook, before we rolled this out, our store would have to wait until the 15th of the month to see the expenses from the previous month. So it's impossible to really manage it effectively. Now you have basically a real-time view of what you're spending based on your budget by line item. So to Carol's point, it gives the store team, just a much better handle and tremendous visibility and transparency around what they're spending, how to spending to the rate of plan, and it just allows us to be much more efficient in managing that overall expense line.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: And staying on the technology theme, can you talk about how much of your sales were online in 2010? And how do you see that growing in 2011? And maybe some of the initiatives behind that as well?\nFrancis Blake: Deb, we've kind of said on online that we're not going to talk about it as a separate business for a while yet. We need it to get to be a more significant than material part of our sales before we break it out.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Which means...\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: I was trying. I know you said, Frank. But I was trying. But can you just maybe talk about some of the initiatives in place?\nFrancis Blake: But we're very pleased with the improvement we've seen on online. And again, for us, it serves multiple functions. It's not only a vehicle for selling product, but it's also a vehicle for educating our customers around product and projects. So as I say we're making a lot of investments in it, and we're very pleased with the progress.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Matthew Fassler at Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: My question relates to market dynamics. I believe you alluded to gaining share in roughly half of your categories as measured by units. If you could give us a sense as to where those share gains were at, how that trend compared with prior quarters? And then as part of that discussion, what you've seen in terms of promotional dynamics in this space, particularly in some of the hotter categories, if you will, like Appliances.\nCraig Menear: This is Craig. We gained share in Building Materials, Tools, Hardware, Plumbing, Electrical, Lawn and Garden, both sides of that, as well as Appliances. And quarter-to-quarter, again, that's unit share based on consumer activity. So quarter-to-quarter, those can fluctuate a little bit. But when we look at it on a rolling 12-month basis, those are areas where we're continuing to show progress over time. And I think as it relates to the marketplace, again, we feel that we're applying a significant amount of pressure in the market in terms of really offering our customers' outstanding values. History of our company has all been about finding special buys, working with our suppliers to come up with something that helps them drive volume through their factories. We can pass along savings to our customers. It creates urgency to bring the customers into the store. And I think we did a really good job of that in the fourth quarter, which helped our numbers. And so we'll continue to follow that strategy.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And any comments on just the competitive dynamic? Did you see competitive responses or competitive aggressiveness, particularly or in November, December?\nCraig Menear: We've seen somewhat similar to previous quarters.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you to everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you at our earnings call, which will be in May.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference.

Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $16.6 billion, up 1.4% from last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.51. This was the fourth quarter in a row of positive comps for our business and the third quarter in a row of positive comps for the U.S., which had a comp of 1.5%.  In the U.S., over 80% of our Top 40 markets positively comped. Compared to prior quarters, the variability of performance has narrowed so that we see less dramatic swings on the positive and on the negative side. For example, in the third quarter of 2009 the spread between the best and worst of our Top 40 markets was about 35 percentage points. This year that spread is cut almost in half to about 18 points.  Our Gulf region is now exiting its year-over-year storm comparison so its negative comps have turned slightly positive. We saw strength in key markets, particularly in our central and mid-Atlantic regions, and we continue to see positive results in Florida and California. So from an overall perspective, we see a stabilizing business; and as the business stabilizes, we continue to improve our operational performance. We are exercising good control over our expenses but we\u2019re also investing in the business to drive improvements across customer service, merchandising, and our supply chain. Let me give one recent example. Our technology and operations teams have developed and implemented a new technology for our store associates. We call it the First Phone because its core purpose is to reduce tasking time for our associates so that they can instead focus on customer service. It is a handheld device that provides several functions \u2013 inventory management, product location, sku category, and class performance analytics; a phone, a walkie-talkie, and a mobile checkout. What makes the First Phone worth discussing are two general points: it was developed through close cooperation with our store operations and IT teams, perhaps the best collaboration we\u2019ve ever had on a project like this; and we see it as a foundational element of improving our service for our DIY and pro customers, putting knowledge and communication closer at hand to our associates on the floor of the store. Similarly, we are continuing the development of our new merchandising tools. As an indicator of that, we had another quarter of improved inventory turns for the Company. Our rollout of rapid deployment centers, or RDCs, remains on track to reach 100% of our U.S. store base by the end of the year; and we are continuing the significant ongoing complementary work designed to get additional leverage from our supply chain. Beyond the supply chain, we are building out a new set of analytical tools for our merchants across assortment planning, pricing, and customer analytics. We\u2019ll discuss those at some greater length at our upcoming investor and analyst conference in December. But just as we have a goal to better enable our associates to deliver great customer service, we also have a goal to better enable our merchants to drive category growth in our business, and in both instances technology is a critical enabler.  As Craig will detail, we\u2019ve seen continued growth in our transactions. This quarter marks the fourth straight quarter of comp transactions growth. This provides some evidence that our market is steadying as customers focus on basic repair and maintenance activities. Average ticket continues to be a challenge just as the macro housing environment remains under pressure. We have often referenced private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP as an indicator of the overall health of the housing related market. This past quarter saw another tick down and another record 60-year low as the ratio is now 2.2%. While our comp performance has disconnected from this metric, at least directionally we still think this presents a picture of continued pressure in our market.  On the international front, our Mexican business continues to deliver positive comps. This is the 28th quarter in a row of positive comps. Not only is our Mexican business an important source of growth for the Company but also increasingly an important source of talent. For example, we have a district manager in Texas who began as a store manager in Mexico, and we have comparable examples of the Mexican team being a source of talent throughout our organization. Our Canadian business, as expected, experienced weakness in the quarter with a negative of 5.6% in local currency as we began to anniversary the impacts of the Canadian government\u2019s home renovation tax credit. The difficult year-over-year comparisons will continue through the fourth quarter.  At the end of the third quarter, 76% of our stores are eligible for success sharing, our bonus program for our hourly associates. Our associates are working hard to improve our business. We\u2019re proud of the progress we\u2019re making while recognizing that we are just at the start of a long-term process; and we look forward to discussing our longer term plans with you in December. And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning everyone. The third quarter represented our fourth quarter in a row of positive comp growth. We saw positive comps in eight departments during the quarter and were pleased with the sequential comp improvement we saw in the U.S. from the second to the third quarter. The departments that outperformed the Company\u2019s average comp were lumber, garden, electrical and lighting. Flooring and hardware performed in line with the Company comp. Plumbing, paint, and kitchen and bath showed positive comps, while comps in millwork and building materials were negative for the quarter. As measured by consumer surveys, we gained consumer U.S. market share in units in nine out of our 13 departments during the quarter. Our strategy remains focused on driving value and innovation in our stores, and we see customers responding favorably to our efforts through increased transactions. Comp transactions were up 2.2% in the quarter. As expected, we have not yet turned the corner on average ticket. Comp average ticket was down 0.8% or $0.43 to $51.46 for the quarter. Smaller ticket purchases were strong during the quarter while the big ticket purchases remained under pressure. Transactions for tickets under $50, roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., were up 2.7% year-over-year. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, also approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down 3.4% in the third quarter. The main drivers behind our small ticket performance were our maintenance and repair, seasonal, and outdoor project businesses.  As we\u2019ve shared in past quarters, maintenance and repair continues to be an area of strength as customers spend money to maintain the investments in their homes. For example, categories such as sealers, plumbing repair, fasteners, water heaters, and cleaning all had strong comp performance in the third quarter. The seasonal business came late in the quarter as record heat across much of the U.S. in August and September kept many DIY gardeners indoors. In contrast, October presented an opportunity for fall planting and lawn repair. We took advantage of this opportunity and used the flexibility that we\u2019ve built into our business through tools and process to delay our holiday sets and deliver to drive our outdoor business through the end of October.  We saw specific strength in seed, chemicals and live goods. For example, our live goods business swung from a low single digit negative comp in the second quarter to a positive comp in the third quarter driven by a double digit comp in the month of October. Additionally, we saw strength in outdoor project categories such as landscape, fencing, exterior paint and windows during the quarter. Finally, we saw continued momentum in paint, hardware, tools, electrical, and plumbing in the third quarter. We\u2019ve been working hard to improve our offering in these areas with a focus on our maintenance and repair customers, and our efforts are paying off.  On the other hand, we continue to see pressure in big ticket. The largest drivers of this big ticket pressure in the third quarter were softness in building materials and discretionary spend areas like kitchens, as well as tough compares in roofing as we lap last year\u2019s heavy storms. We continue to execute our portfolio strategy and drive results from our investments in merchandising category resets, new product introductions, and the implementation of everyday great value. Let me share a few examples of this. During the quarter, we had an outstanding bath event called Vanity Insanity. We saw great results and terrific project selling from our associates during this event. We also introduced exciting new products such as additional LED bulbs in our EcoSmart brand which can save customers up to 80% on their electric bills\u2014or lighting bills.  Water savings products have also resonated well with our customers such as our Glacier Bay dual flush toilets and the HydroRight dual flush conversion kit. And for our d\u00e9cor customers, we introduced Martha Stewart Kitchens, which is off to a fast start in our stores. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are well positioned to drive sales with a great seasonal lineup of heaters, fireplaces, and snow removal equipment. We will also be rolling out several new product introductions including the expansion of our Klein tools for professional electricians, USG\u2019s lightweight drywall that is 30% lighter than regular drywall panels, and a new line of epoxy grouts from Custom Building Products that do not require sealing. Additionally, we leaned into the holiday season this year and increased our buys. Holiday d\u00e9cor is an inexpensive way for our customers and feel good about their homes. We have enhanced our offering with the Martha Stewart coordinated d\u00e9cor items and launched the EcoSmart LED lighting which features exclusive new technology, including fully water resistant continuous-on lights so that if one breaks or comes loose, the rest stay lit.  We also have outstanding values in our gift centers this year, as well as an incredible Black Friday lineup. The early results from these categories have been strong and we\u2019re confident they will continue to drive customers to Home Depot stores.  And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9:  Thank you, Craig, and hello everyone. In the third quarters, sales were $16.6 billion, a 1.4% increase from last year. Comps for same store sales were positive 1.4% for the quarter with positive comps up 0.7% in August, positive 1.1% in September, and positive 2.9% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 1.5% for the quarter wit positive comps of 0.6% in August, flat comps in September, and positive comps of 3.5 in October. Our gross margin was 34.3% for the quarter, an increase of 26 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business contributed 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter driven by the following factors: first, 5 basis points of expansion came from lower deferred interest due to a lower penetration of private label credit card sales; second, approximately 5 basis points of expansion was due to commodity price inflation. Finally, through our portfolio approach and leveraging our newly developed analytics, we enjoyed another 10 basis points of net gross margin expansion, with some departments like hardware and plumbing reporting margin growth, and some departments like kitchen and bath reporting margin contraction. Our international businesses, principally Canada, contributed 6 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold.  Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 74 basis points to 25.5% and total operating expense dollars were $61 million less than last year. Our operating leverage reflects positive same store sales as well as lower expense in the following areas: first, depreciation expense was $28 million under last year due to a lower asset base arising from fully depreciated assets; second, medical expense was $20 million under last year due to a number of items including a lower number of enrollees; third, we settled several real estate matters for a net $20 million benefit; and finally, we had a number of other expenses under last year offset by expense increases in categories like credit card discounts. These items net to a $7 million increase in expense from last year. At the end of the second quarter, we told you that we expected to see strong expense leverage in the back half of the year. Year-to-date on an adjusted basis, our expense growth equaled approximately 30% of the growth in our sales. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued expense leverage such that for the year, expenses will grow at less than 30% of the growth in our sales. Interest and other expense for the third quarter totaled $142 million, down $22 million from last year, reflecting lower levels of outstanding indebtedness.  Our income tax provision rate was 36.1% in the third quarter. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.  Earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.51, up 24.4% from last year and reflects about two pennies of benefit arising from our share repurchases.  Now moving to our operational metrics, at the end of the third quarter we were operating 2,244 stores and selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the third quarter were $281, up roughly 1.7%. Now turning to the balance sheet, we continued to effectively manage our inventory. At the end of the quarter, inventory was approximately $11 billion, up $176 million from a year ago. About half of that increase is attributable to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Inventory turns were 4.3 times, up from 4.2 times a year ago. We ended the quarter with $41.7 billion in assets, including $1.4 billion in cash. Year-to-date this reflects cash generated by the business of approximately $3.9 billion offset by $2 billion used for share repurchases, $1.2 billion used for dividends, and approximately $700 million of capital expenditures. Note that for fiscal 2010, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion. Now on the capital structure front, a few items of note. First in the third quarter, we repurchased $800 million or 26.3 million shares of outstanding stock. Second during the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes that came due on August 15 and subsequently refinanced them on September 7 for a weighted average maturity of 20 years with an average coupon of approximately 4.7%.  Finally, computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 12%, 250 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Given that we\u2019ve got nine months of performance behind us, we\u2019re going to tighten up the sales and earnings guidance we gave you at the end of the second quarter. Looking ahead, we are projecting positive comp sales in the low single digit area in Q4. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase by approximately 2.2% with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing by approximately 25% to $1.94. Within this guidance, we expect our operating margin to be approximately 8.4% for the year.  This guidance includes the benefit of our year-to-date share repurchases but doesn\u2019t include the impact of any additional share repurchases. It is our intent, however, to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010. We look forward to covering our business prospects, including our thoughts on 2011, at our investor conference on December 8. We thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. So Abdullah, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Once again, please press star, one on your touchtone telephone to ask a question today. That\u2019s star, one on your touchtone telephone. We ask that you depress your mute button to allow your signal to reach our equipment. And we\u2019ll pause for just a moment. And we\u2019ll take our first question from Chris Horvers with JP Morgan.\nChris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan: Thanks and good morning.\nFrank Blake: Morning.\nChris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan: Given that\u2014I know it\u2019s a couple weeks into the quarter, but we do always get a lot of questions on how November\u2019s looking so far. You had some events on LED light bulbs and focusing on everyday value; so I was just curious how the quarter is shaping up so far, albeit early. And then secondly on the gross margin, can you talk about whether RDCs have been a drag or kind of neutral to merchandise margins this year; and then if so, are we still thinking maybe 30, 40 basis points of potential gross margin expansion in \u201911? Thank you.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well on the sales front, as you point out, it is early days but we\u2019re very pleased with our sales through November. And on the gross margin front, the RDCs have been pretty much neutral to our gross margin performance this year; and as we look to 2011, and we\u2019ll share more details with you at our investor conference, but as we look to 2011 we expect to see benefit from coming from the RDC.\nChris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nFrank Blake: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot, and good morning. My first question relates to credit and your credit cards. Can you talk about the impact of your ability to use your percent financing as a lever and also just consumers\u2019 appetite for credit, be it from your proprietary card or from other sources, and how you think might tie into the big ticket side of the business and some of the soft trends you\u2019re seeing there.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yeah well, it\u2019s interesting. As we look at our private label credit card, we saw about a 300 basis point contraction in terms of the penetration of our private label card, dropping from about 26% last year to about 23% this year. And of that 300 basis point contraction, about 150 basis points was in the deferred financing fees; in other words, for any purchases over $299 where everyday we offer a deferred financing option. So what we are seeing is a change in how consumers are using credit, and we think a lot of it is a headset change because of the Card Act, which as you know, Matt, was enacted back in February. Before the Card Act, our everyday value proposition was if you spent $299 in our stores, it was no interest, no payments for six months. It\u2019s now no interest, minimum payment. The customers are looking at that minimum payment and albeit it\u2019s a small payment, but they\u2019re looking at that minimum payment and saying hmm, I\u2019m not sure that value proposition works for me anymore and so they\u2019re switching out to bank cards, and we\u2019ve seen an increase in our bank card penetration accordingly.  But if you step back from it, if you look at the savings rates in the country, you know that the savings rates now are over 4%, and historically the savings rates in the country were around 2%, so consumers have definitely deleveraged. We continue to look at our private label card as a way of driving sales. The approval rates for our card is north of 70%, so that\u2019s pretty good. The average line that\u2019s being approved is over $5,000. The average line for the existing cardholders is close to $6,000, but there\u2019s only 25% utilization so it goes back to this sort of savings mentality that we see with consumers in our country. They\u2019re just delevering.  So that\u2019s a long-winded answer to your question but hopefully that\u2019s helpful.\nMatthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs: And I guess I\u2019ll ask my follow-up on the same topic. Are you able to map the trends that you\u2019ve seen in big ticket in some of the categories that you\u2019ve cited as being under pressure - like, for example, the kitchen category \u2013 to the deferred financing dynamics in particular; and if so, I know the Card Act was passed in February. When do you cycle those changes in your business?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We see some of the pressures, surely, in our big ticket items like kitchens and appliances as a result of this lower penetration of the deferred financing. We will lap the Card Act in February.\nMatthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Got it. Thank you so much.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Good morning guys. How are you?\nFrank Blake: Good morning.\nScot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: In the past, and I know it\u2019s been a while, but you had given us some information regarding the difference in sales performance in various geographic areas based on kind of foreclosure activities, but now that you guys are seeing more uniform performance kind of across the country and positive comps in 80% of your regions, is there anything you can point to as kind of a common denominator in your best markets and in your softest markets?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well as Frank pointed out, private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP dropped to a historic low of 2.2%, so we would say that housing\u2019s grip on the economy is as loose as it has been in 60 years. So it\u2019s really interesting as we look at the drivers of private fixed residential investment \u2013 for example, housing turnover. When we do our regression analysis, we see the r-squared between housing turnover and our sales at 0.58. That\u2019s not a strong correlation, and there\u2019s about four percentage points standard error in that calculation. So housing metrics are becoming less relevant as a measure for our sales, and as we look at it we\u2019re sensing that GDP is more relevant. And that is, I think, one reason why we\u2019re seeing less\u2014the spread has narrowed in terms of the performance across the country. And Frank--?\nFrank Blake: Yeah, no I think that\u2019s exactly right. And Scot, that was a bit to my point of the variability among the markets kind of compressing, so that you see, just as Carol said, the more general economic impacts going across our business rather than the particularization around either a foreclosure rate or housing crisis in a particular market as we\u2019ve seen in the past.\nScot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: You think it\u2019s more of an employment issue at this point, or consumer confidence issue?\nFrank Blake: Well I think, again, just as Carol said, I think we\u2019re seeing some broader economic things. It\u2019s how we track to GDP, unemployment, savings rate. The more general economic environment seems to be a better predictor.\nScot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.\nDeborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks so much. So just a few questions focusing actually on growth. So number one, can you update us on your thoughts on HomeDepot.com and social media and how you are using them for holiday and also mobile in your stores?\nFrank Blake: It\u2019s a great question, Deborah, and we\u2019ll be spending some time on that in December at our conference. HD.com is a very important part of our business. It\u2019s not just\u2014and you know, we really don\u2019t\u2014the sales part of it is obviously something we focus on but even more important, we know that customers\u2014in some categories as much as 70% of our customers research the categories online before coming into the stores. We have a variety of things underway on our social media including our own Home Depot community now that we\u2019re very proud of, where we\u2019ve actually taken associates from our stores and they work for a couple of days online answering questions from associates on a how-to basis. We\u2019re very pleased with the reaction to that. So yeah, it\u2019s growing importance across our business, what we\u2019d call interconnected retail \u2013 how we stitch all those things together from our bricks and mortar to the dot-com to the social media.\nDeborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup: And also continuing my focus on growth, with the growth in customer transactions, is that more foot traffic from existing customers or gaining new customers?\nFrank Blake: So I\u2019ll be honest. I\u2019m not sure we have a very good way of dialing into that right now. I mean, it\u2019s a great question but we really don\u2019t have a metric that looks at, hey, this is a brand new customer and we feel confident that it\u2019s a brand new customer.\nDeborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup: Because you\u2019re devoting more of your labor hours to customer-facing activities, so wouldn\u2019t that speak to improving customer service and\u2014\nFrank Blake: You know, I think it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that our typical customer visits a Home Depot, what, four times a year. So every single visit is an opportunity to increase frequency and get the conversion. And Marvin, you might want to comment on that as well.\nMarvin Ellison:  Yeah Deborah, as we\u2019ve said in the past, we have a real simple equation of compelling value from the merchants, improved services from the associates in the store on the engagement piece, and we think that creates transactions which turn into dollars. And for this past quarter, our net promoter score increased 580 basis points, and that\u2019s on top of a 500-plus basis points improvement last year to the same time frame. And again, when we get excited in the stores around products and around great offerings, our associates are just focused on service in a much more aggressive way. And as we have noted in the past, we have this philosophy of transferring our payroll hours from task to service, and we\u2019re on this mission to get a greater percent of our payroll on service, and we\u2019ll end this year at roughly 50/50. And we\u2019ve never been there before but our goal is to have significantly more hours dedicated to the service component versus the back office tasking part of the business. So we\u2019re good progress but we still have a lot of work to do.\nDeborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup: Okay, and then last question \u2013 given the importance of the pro customer to your business, what trends are you seeing with that customer right now?\nFrank Blake: So as we\u2019ve said in the past, Deborah, a couple of comments on the pro. The first is we changed our way of measuring it, so as we would have previously measured it which would be on our credit card or sales through the pro desk, we\u2019re seeing better than Company growth from the segment. As we got a more refined look at it, though, we actually saw that that pro customer shopping across the store, as measured by shopping behavior, was actually down and it looks to be\u2014you know, we\u2019re in the flattish range now. But it\u2019s still not the engine of growth for us.\nDeborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup: Great. I appreciate the color, and best of luck over the holidays.\nFrank Blake: Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.\nGary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse:  Thank you. These are, I guess, mostly follow-ups or just expands on some things you talked about. But Carol, you talked about the 58%--or 58 r-squared number to go with the housing turnover. Could you talk about or just remind us again of your mix of business in terms of how much is maintenance and repair, and how much is dependent on housing turnover, etc.?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: You know, Gary, there\u2019s no bright line here, and there never has been a bright line.\nGary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse: Right.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Because our customers, regardless of they\u2019re a pro or DIY or they shop across the store.\nFrank Blake: Yeah, the last time we took a look at it, and we get the question enough that probably we ought to do a deep dive again, but the last time we looked at it we were about 25% driven by turnover, 25% that was strictly had to repair kind of spend, and then 50% that you\u2019d put in the discretionary bucket. But the last time I want to say was kind of in 2006, and so odds are that 25% that was turnover relate has gone down significantly and the percentages would look quite different.\nGary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse: Okay, with the repair probably up.\nFrank Blake: Yes, exactly. Exactly.\nGary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse:  Could you talk about the Durbin Amendment impact on your business, or how you see that playing out?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, yes. The Durbin Amendment gives the right to the federal reserve to set the fee for debit cards, as I think you all will recall. And as we looked at it when the Durbin Amendment was passed as part of the Dodd-Frank bill, we modeled well, if the Fed follows what other countries like Australia or New Zealand have done, it should be a benefit for us in 2011 and we estimated it could be as much as $30 million. What we\u2019re hearing, Gary, is that the Federal Reserve is struggling with how to go about this. So as we build our plans for next year, we\u2019re not building any benefit in today because we need more clarity.\nGary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse: Okay. Okay. Thank you.\nFrank Blake: Thanks.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alan Rifkin with Bank of America.\nAlan Rifkin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. With the RDC program now essentially over and certainly it looks like your (inaudible) at the corporate level have certainly benefited from that. Can you maybe provide some color on the impact of the RDC program on the stores supported earlier in the program versus later? And then I have a follow-up.\nFrank Blake: So the first comment, and then Mark Holifield is here and I\u2019ll ask him to address that; but the first comment would be the RDC program\u2014I mean, there\u2019s the building the physical assets. The build of the physical assets will be over by the end of this year, but truly that\u2019s sort of the start of the overall process because you have to ramp up the amount of product that\u2019s going through the RDC. There are continual improvements, and Mark can talk to this, of where we\u2019re backporting mechanization into existing RDCs, and Mark and his team continue to improve just the internal operating rhythm of the RDC, so our work on the RDC is really just\u2014I mean, we\u2019re not at the starting line but we\u2019re early on into the race. And I\u2019d say just as a general comment for our stores, it would be\u2014you know, we have been very pleased as the program has rolled out in terms of the benefits our stores are seeing in our in-stock rate because along with the improvements in the inventory turns that we call out, what we don\u2019t call out at every call but is the case \u2013 we are at a record high performance in terms of in-stocks, and so we\u2019re very pleased with how the RDCs are impacting our stores. Mark, I don\u2019t know if you want to add some comments, or Marvin, to that?\nMark Holifield: Yeah, sure. It\u2019s Mark Holifield. We will be wrapping up the RDC program in January. We\u2019ve got two openings coming in December and one in January. As Frank said, we certainly are in the early days of these RDCs. If you think about it, at this point only 6 of our 16 open RDCs have been open more than a year, so it\u2019s still very early in the history there. Lots of opportunity to continuously improve our operations. We\u2019re at about 41% of cogs going through the RDCs at this point. We think ultimately about half of our cogs will roll through there. The results that we\u2019ve seen are the continuing improvements in in-stock that Frank has talked about. Our RDC-served store sku combinations get back in stock quicker once there is an out of stock, and we are seeing lower inventory levels to maintain that in-stock level at the stores. But as we say, just getting rolling, really an immature network but we\u2019ve got lots of opportunity for upside as the years go on. \nMarvin Ellison: Alan, this is Marvin from a store operation perspective. Eighty percent of the product that we order from RDC goes directly to the shelf. So from a payroll productivity standpoint in stores, that\u2019s a big deal. You think about in the past, product went from receiving to the overhead, then it had to be taken from the overhead to the shelf which takes up hours away from customers, and it takes productive payroll and turns it into non-productive payroll of tasking. Now 80% straight to the shelf, which means you have more time to serve customers and more time to use payroll from a more productive perspective, so it\u2019s been a big win for us in the stores.\nAlan Rifkin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, and one follow-up if I may for either Carol or Frank. I know that you\u2019ve said that you will continue to use excess cash to buy back stock. Our cash flow projections would suggest that there\u2019s a capacity to buy back 3 billion for the year, which would leave $1 billion in the fourth quarter alone. Is our line of thinking in that much stock in the fourth quarter alone could potentially be bought back if your projections are met?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: The way we\u2019d like you to think about this is that we\u2019ll buy back in the fourth quarter about what we bought back in the third.\nAlan Rifkin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you, Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Melich with ISI.\nGreg Melich \u2013 ISI Group: Hi, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. I have two questions \u2013 one is the inflation and what that did to the comp. I think you gave us the gross margin impact but do you have the comp number?\nFrank Blake: It\u2019s about 19 basis points of comp was impacted from copper, so copper was really the driver behind comp inflation in the third quarter, so a pretty significant ramp there.\nGreg Melich \u2013 ISI Group:  Okay, and as you go forward, we would\u2014just given what you\u2019re seeing today, that should continue and even accelerate in the fourth quarter?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Copper prices are running, aren\u2019t they?\nFrank Blake: Yeah.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We don\u2019t know where they go.\nFrank Blake : Who knows where they go, but yeah. At this point we\u2019d say it probably continues.\nGreg Melich \u2013 ISI Group: Great. And then Carol, you said the CAPEX guidance at one point, 1 billion, but that would imply about 400 million in the fourth quarter. How should we think about that? Is the 400 million sort of a new run rate for CAPEX as we go into next year, because I know there\u2019s been some moving around in terms of the timing of CAPEX.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We\u2019re going to give you a lot more color on our capital plan for our 2011 when we get together in December. Right now, we\u2019re looking at a capital plan next year of around 1.3 billion, but I will tell you there\u2019s $100 million of that, more or less, that\u2019s unallocated at this point. So you can model it however you want.\nGreg Melich \u2013 ISI Group: Got it. And then a last one, sort of bigger picture, Frank. If you look at the stabilization, that spread going from 35 to 18% over the past year, is it the traffic that\u2019s really been the stabilization factor or has it been the people that are in the market being able to spend a more consistent amount? So really, is it all traffic driven or is there some ticket stabilization as well?\nFrank Blake: Traffic, clearly, for us has been the significant thing that\u2019s happened over the last several quarters, is the growing traffic.\nGreg Melich \u2013 ISI Group: And as you look forward, is there anything you would say, you know, that you cycle that? You\u2019re not concerned that there\u2019s any sort of one-offs that made that traffic shift, anything other than a good building trend?\nFrank Blake: Greg, I think when you look at\u2014as I mentioned, when we look at our paint department, our hardware department, our plumbing, our electrical \u2013 kind of the core center of the store \u2013 we\u2019ve continued to see improvement in those businesses as we\u2019ve worked on them, and I think that\u2019s the real foundational base that\u2019s helping us drive the core business overall in the traffic growth.\nGreg Melich \u2013 ISI Group: And it sounds like that\u2019s true even in the housing markets that might still have down turnover and sloppy pricing. Is that fair?\nFrank Blake: Yes. Yes, it is.\nGreg Melich \u2013 ISI Group: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Baker \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Thank you. So I wanted to focus quick on the sales. So the full year sales guidance plus 2.2, I think on the last quarterly call you said full year sales up 2.6. Sounds like you did a pretty good third quarter here and trend is good, so why the downtick? That\u2019s the first question. And then the second question is I know you guys do benchmark some of your sales results against the government sales statistics \u2013 building material and gardening equipment and supply stores, No. 444, where that actually trended more positive in the third quarter versus the second quarter; whereas your comps didn\u2019t show the same acceleration. So any explanation for that would be helpful. Thanks.\nFrank Baker: Yeah. Mike, the first thing is\u2014to be honest, if you look at the NIACS numbers through the year, they\u2019ve been stronger than ours; and we know that they changed their way of measuring it. We don\u2019t know exactly what it is. It\u2019s\u2014your comment\u2019s right. We don\u2019t have a lot of insight into exactly what\u2019s going on with that number and our comparison to it. We did\u2014we felt in the spring that it was driven heavily by the lawn and garden business. That seemed to be the case on the numbers that we saw in NIACS. Less clear in the fall \u2013 we just don\u2019t have that breakout yet, but that seems to be the case.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And on the sales question, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter, but Canada was softer than we had projected. Now, Canada relative to the competitors did very well, but relative to our plan was softer; and if you look to the fourth quarter, we know we\u2019re up against tough comparisons so we\u2019ve just tightened up our guidance accordingly.\nMichael Baker \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Okay. So the biggest change sounds like Canada. That makes sense. If I could ask one more question on the SG&A. I think historically you\u2019ve said expenses growing at 50% of sales. You\u2019re obviously going to do a lot better than that this year. Looking ahead, how do we think about that? Was there something specific in 2010 that has enabled you to beat that, or is that sort of the new run rate, closer to 30 or less percent?\nFrank Blake: Again, we\u2019ll have an opportunity to talk to you about this in December and give you\u2014you know, every year is its own plan and, frankly, we want to be able to lay out for you in a coherent fashion what we see as our headwinds and issues and how we\u2019re going to be addressing them in 2011.\nMichael Baker \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Okay, we\u2019ll look forward to that. Thank you.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lasser with Barclays Capital.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 Barclays Capital: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So the home improvement market is becoming less connected to key housing metrics and more connected to broader economic factors. Does that change the competitive set with Home Depot potentially competing more against traditional retailers such as the mass merch?\nFrank Blake: No, I wouldn\u2019t put it that way, Michael. I\u2019d say it\u2019s more\u2014and this is just, I mean, we have a theory of the case, and this is the theory of the case, is that if you look at some of the traditional guideposts in our market like housing turns, and you see that that doesn\u2019t correlate as closely with our results anymore, a theory is as Carol was saying, that\u2019s now such a small number overall that the larger economic forces are really the stronger driver on the correlation. But it doesn\u2019t change our competitive set.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 Barclays Capital: Okay. I guess the composition of the business is changing with a greater proportion of sales coming from small ticket items. Does that alter how you think about your promotional stance with the possibility of being more aggressive on those small ticket items and less aggressive on the big ticket stuff, which are proving to be somewhat inelastic, perhaps? \nFrank Blake: No, that\u2019s not really how we\u2019re thinking about it. We\u2019re working to drive, obviously, the basics around what the customer needs to maintain their homes and businesses, so that maintenance and repair is really, really important. But the customer still is doing the core updates; it\u2019s just not at the rate that they were doing them before. And we focused a little bit on smaller projects \u2013 as I mentioned, our Vanity Insanity event, a great way for a customer to update the bathroom in their home. They\u2019ll take on that project maybe before they take on a kitchen project. So we\u2019re just making slight tweaks and adjustments as to how we\u2019re going to market.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 Barclays Capital: Okay, one quick last question. Carol, on the D&A, how much further is there to go to benefit from that? How much of the asset base is fully depreciated at this point?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We\u2019re working through that model right now. We\u2019ll give you a new D&A forecast for 2011 when we get together in December.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 Barclays Capital: Sounds great. Look forward to seeing you soon.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yeah, thanks so much.\nFrank Blake: Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company: Good morning.\nFrank Blake: Good morning, Eric.\nEric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company: Can you talk a bit about your thinking and strategy in terms of promotions and what you\u2019re bringing in, and the events you have planned for 4Q? It seems like you\u2019ve done a good job of managing inventories on a rational promotional environment in a sluggish sales environment this year. How are you thinking about those variables as we move into 4Q?\nFrank Blake: Well Eric, I obviously can\u2019t go into detail in terms of what we\u2019re doing later in the fourth quarter. Don\u2019t want to educate the world on that; however, what I will tell you is we\u2019re continuing to focus on trying to shift our business to everyday great value for our customers. As I\u2019ve mentioned in several occasions in the past, we\u2019re not bright there by any means. There\u2019s still activity out there promotionally that takes place that we have to address in the market. As I look in the fourth quarter, again, we\u2019re focused on bringing new product introductions to market. We do work with our suppliers and it\u2019s been historically something we\u2019ve done to create great special buys where we can leverage the productivity in the factories, pass those savings on to our customers, so we feel really good about the buys that we\u2019ve made for the holiday gift season, the Black Friday events as I mentioned. So I think\u2014you know, we feel that we\u2019re well positioned to compete in the marketplace. We do believe that we\u2019ve gained ground in things like holiday d\u00e9cor and the seasonal businesses around fireplace and snow removal in the northern sector of the country over the past couple years, and we\u2019ve worked hard to position ourselves well for that in the fourth quarter. So we think we\u2019ve got a great offering for our customers coming up in the fourth quarter to keep driving traffic to our stores. \nEric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company: Strategically as you look at your effort, I think the flyer last week was a bit\u2014or was meaningfully aggressive year over year in appliances. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of are you\u2014are you trying to stay at the same level in terms of promotional intensity? Was that just a category or is that reflective of a bit of step to a more aggressive level for 4Q?\nCraig Menear: I mean, when we look at our appliance business, we\u2019re roughly kind of doing what we did last year. We obviously assess our value offering for the customer and try to make sure that we\u2019re competitive and driving business in the market.\nEric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nFrank Blake: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDan Binder \u2013 Jefferies :  Hi, good morning. Now that you\u2019re seeing the business stabilize and you look at new business opportunities, I\u2019m just curious what\u2019s at the top of mind? You\u2019ve mentioned MRO quite a bit for home and business. I\u2019m curious \u2013 is that an opportunity to go after that more aggressively, not just within store but out of store type prospecting? And then how the stabilizing environment change the way you think about store growth as well going forward?\nFrank Blake: So it\u2019s stabilizing is the word. I think the way we think about our business is really driven off of the portfolio strategy, and there are areas that are important for us to continue dynamic, be the absolute destination and other areas that we deemphasize; but this isn\u2019t, if I understood kind of the context of the question, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re saying okay, now. We\u2019re all set \u2013 now let\u2019s go launch a new effort in some other area. This is we\u2019re going to keep doing what we\u2019ve been doing and hopefully do it better and better.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And as you know, our economic engine is driven by productivity and efficiency. And if you look at our return on invested capital up 250 basis points year on year to now 12%, our store deployment strategy is working. This year we\u2019re opening seven stores; next year maybe 10. So we are going to continue to drive the productivity in our existing boxes.\nDan Binder \u2013 Jefferies: Yeah, I guess what I was trying to drive at is now that you\u2019re seeing some stability and that adds confidence to the type of investments you\u2019re making, are there other types of opportunities outside of the core stores that would make sense to you?\nFrank Blake: It\u2019s still our\u2014I mean, we are focused on our core business.\nDan Binder \u2013 Jefferies: Okay, great.\nCraig Menear: There\u2019s several billion dollars out there over the past two years that we gave up that we need to go get.\nDan Binder \u2013 Jefferies: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.\nPeter Benedict \u2013 Robert Baird: Hey guys. A couple quick ones. First, can you remind us what percentage of the business is the installed sales business, and how has that been trending? Any regional color, particularly out in California and places like Florida?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Install business is a pretty small piece of our business. It\u2019s less than 10%. And if we look at the performance in the third quarter, it was down just slightly.\nFrank Blake: And I don\u2019t know that we have a regional\u2014\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We don\u2019t. \nPeter Benedict \u2013 Robert Baird:  Okay. And then Carol, just on the leverage ratio, leverage cap. You\u2019ve been saying 2.5 times. I know you\u2019re running below that, about 2.1 at this point. What do you need to see to kind of trend yourself back towards that 2.5 ratio?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, Frank used the choice word \u2013 stabilizing. Stabilized would be good; stabilizing\u2014you know, we\u2019re just early in the recovery, Peter, so we\u2019re just watching the business pretty carefully. Obviously things are going in the right direction. We\u2019re pretty opportunistic and we look at the interest rate environment, which is really attractive, of course; but our point of view is that interest rates will remain low for a long period of time, so there\u2019s no hurry for us to go and lever up to buy back more shares. \nPeter Benedict \u2013 Robert Baird: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff: We have time for one more question, Abdullah.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our last question from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James & Associates.\nBudd Bugatch \u2013 Raymond James & Associates:  Good morning. Thank you and congratulations as well. Just a quick question, if you would. The kitchen area has been an area of difficult performance all throughout this situation, particularly with housing and all of that issue. What are you thinking, Craig, about the way to maybe generate some better performance out of the kitchen business, out of the cabinet side of it?\nCraig Menear: Well, I mean, you\u2019re right, Budd. The industry over the past several years has been in dramatic decline. And so we\u2019re really focused on making sure that we can address all the customers\u2019 needs in that area for those customers that actually are looking at cabinets. So we\u2019ve worked hard to improve our overall assembled cabinet business for those customers that want to get going and do it right away. We have the capability of redoing the fronts of the cabinets. It\u2019s a program that actually is doing well for us. We obviously can replace the customer\u2019s cabinets. We\u2019ve worked on expanding our offering in our countertops, so if the customer wants to make an update without changing out their cabinets, we\u2019ve got a greater offering there. And of course we\u2019ve added the Martha Stewart line into our kitchen cabinet business that is off to a terrific start. So there\u2019s a number of things that we\u2019re doing to drive productivity in that area. While the industry has been shrinking, the numbers that we are able to look at shows that we\u2019re actually gaining share in the category.\nBudd Bugatch \u2013 Raymond James & Associates: And I\u2019m seeing some indications at the upper end are starting to see some more at least rumblings of business to come. Are you seeing that as well? Are you getting more potential customers to lay out plans for?\nCraig Menear: Well, we just added the Decora line in about 600 of our stores. It\u2019s pretty early. We really don\u2019t have a clear read on that yet.\nBudd Bugatch \u2013 Raymond James & Associates: Okay. And final question just if you could, is do we know the actual net promoter score? I heard 580 basis point improvement. What\u2019s the score in the third quarter?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I\u2019ve got it. Just a second here and I\u2019ll give it to you. The net score was 71.6.\nBudd Bugatch \u2013 Raymond James & Associates: Okay. Congratulations.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Budd.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well thank you everyone for joining us today, and for most of you we\u2019ll be talking to you on December 8 in Boston. Those that cannot join us, you can actually listen to us on the web. And those who just listened to our earnings call, we\u2019ll be talking to you at the end of the fourth quarter.

Today\u2019s presentations also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided in the financial statements included with our earnings release. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thank you Diane, and good morning everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $19.4 billion, up 1.8% from last year. Comp sales were positive 1.7%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 1%. From a geographic perspective, 70% of our top 40 U.S. markets positively comped in the second quarter. Florida and California continued their positive growth paths with performance in line with the company average. We saw a retreat from some of the very strong numbers in the first quarter, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, where key markets like Portland and Seattle turned to negative comps. But on a year over year comparison for the second quarter, every market except the hurricane-impacted market of Houston improved. As Craig will detail, one of the clear patterns of the first and second quarters was a shift in the timing of outdoor garden [spending]. We had something of a bathtub effect in the first half in garden. Strength in the first quarter was counterbalanced by weakness in the second quarter, but overall in garden the first half came out about where we expected. And it\u2019s a similar picture for the company as a whole. We anticipated that second quarter comps would decline from the first quarter. They did, but for the half we came in ahead of where we had planned. This gives us some confidence as we look into the back half. We have two quarters in a row of positive comps in the U.S. We have a continuing pattern of positive comp transactions in our stores. We\u2019re gaining share in key categories, and basic execution across the business is sound. We are also continuing to invest in our core initiatives. We opened our 14th and 15th rapid deployment centers, or RDCs, during the quarter in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona, and we just opened our 16th RDC in Findlay, Ohio yesterday. RDCs now serve over 80% of our U.S. stores, and we remain on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of the year. This has been a huge undertaking that has involved the entire organization, and we think it\u2019s a very positive sign that in the midst of this build out, the company is also improving its inventory turns. For the third quarter in a row, our inventory turns have improved. This is something we hadn\u2019t achieved in almost a decade. Craig and the merchandising team continue to develop and use new merchandising tools. The benefits of this are most clearly seen in our reduced markdowns for seasonal categories like patio and barbecue grills, where better visibility into, and planning for, seasonal inventory has significantly reduced the markdowns necessary to effectively exit those categories. Marvin and the store operations team are also continuing on the path of improving customer service. We have previously discussed our customer FIRST program. Marvin has now launched a version of that for our pro customers and a special version focused on our checkout process, and we continue to see improvement in our net promoter scores. On the international front, our Canadian business had flat comps for the quarter as it experienced some of the same impacts in the western regions of Canada as the U.S. experienced in the Pacific Northwest. And our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps, making it 27 quarters in a row of positive comp growth. There are, however, reasons to be cautious across our business. We still see weakness in our pro segment. We had anticipated that we would start to see growth in our pro customers as we moved into the second quarter, and based on that we thought we\u2019d see gradual improvement in our average ticket. We\u2019re now forecasting modest to flat improvement on the pro side, which puts pressure on average ticket. We also are anticipating softer housing related activity than we originally thought. Clearly, there was some pull-forward of activity from the home buyer tax credits and foreclosures remain high. And of course, on a broader economic level, unemployment remains stubbornly high and wage growth weak. All of these factors counsel caution as we enter the back half of the year. As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are maintaining our earnings guidance for the year, but revising our sales guidance to reflect these concerns. Instead of significant sequential improvement from the first half to the back half, we now think that the two halves will be similar, after adjusting for commodity price inflation. Our market has been through four extremely difficult years. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP remains at historically low levels, but as uncertain as the economic climate is, we are seeing our business return to sales growth and the hardest hit parts of the country start to stabilize. So we will continue to invest and position our business for recovery. I want to thank our associates for their hard work in the second quarter. We are very proud of the fact that 97% of our stores will be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thanks Frank, and good morning everyone. As expected, second quarter comps showed some deceleration following a strong first quarter and seasonal pull-forward, but we\u2019re pleased with our overall performance. The departments that outperformed the company average comp were lumber, electrical lighting, and plumbing. Kitchens and flooring performed at the company average comp. Hardware and paint showed positive comps, while comps in millwork, seasonal, and building materials were slightly negative for the quarter. Based on census data through June, our U.S. market share is up 28 basis point on a 12-month rolling basis. We continue to see strength in transactions, but have not yet turned the corner on average ticket. Comp transactions were up 1.7% in the quarter, but overall comp average ticket remained flat at $52.30. Reflecting the economic environment, we continued to see negative growth in big ticket. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down 4.9% in the second quarter. This was driven by continued pressure on big ticket discretionary spending projects, as well as lower appliance sales, which negatively impacted the company\u2019s comp by 30 basis points in the quarter. Transactions for tickets under $50, also roughly 20% of the business in the U.S., were up 2.4% year over year. The primary drivers of this were the continued strength in repair and maintenance projects and simple d\u00e9cor. In the second quarter, categories such as cleaning, plumbing repair, roofing, chemicals, and safety and security led the way. Let me share with you some specifics around our seasonal business in the quarter. We saw positive comp growth across several seasonal product categories, such as barbecue grills, portable power equipment, and landscape lighting. This summer\u2019s record heat across much of the U.S. drove double-digit comps in products like air conditioners and fans. In contrast, the excessive heat kept many DIY gardeners indoors, and we saw softer comp performance in live goods and landscape than anticipated. As an example, live goods went from high single digit positive comps in the first quarter to negative comps in the second quarter. To put all of this in perspective, of the deceleration in U.S. comps that we saw from the first quarter to the second quarter, approximately 200 basis points are directly related to outdoor categories, offset by 40 basis points of growth in air cooling. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our performance year to date in our seasonal business, and we feel good about our inventory position in seasonal categories as we enter the third quarter. We continue to execute our portfolio strategy and drive results from our investments in merchandise category resets, new product introductions, and the implementation of our everyday great value. Let me share a few examples of this. First, program resets in place for more than 13 weeks are exceeding our expectations. Enhanced discipline around planning and impact modeling has led to more productive resets and less disruption for our stores. Second, we have added new products to strengthen portions of a category\u2019s line structure. In carpet, we launched the new Martha Stewart and Platinum Plus programs, which provide customers with lifetime stain warrantees. Last week these programs provided over 100% lift in sales, versus a year ago from the products that they replaced. Third, we\u2019ve been working to provide everyday great values across all levels of price points. In hand tools, we improved our offerings in both the opening and the upper price point segments. In tool storage, we updated our Husky product in the upper price point segments. And we introduced Ryobi\u2019s Lithium One Plus technology into cordless outdoor power equipment. With these introductions, each of these categories delivered positive comp performance in the second quarter. Lastly, we continued to drive excellent execution in inventory through better process, new forecasting tools, and leveraging our new supply chain capabilities. Let me offer some details. Around process, we combined our import and domestic DCs, which have begun to yield benefits through a more simplified approach to product flow. We also completed the rollout of our Teradata DCM forecasting tool for centrally replenished items. This enables us to make better inventory decisions and react more quickly to trends in the business at a store SKU level. And of course, you know about our RDCs, which among many other things shorten effective lead time, eliminate vendor minimums, and improve productivity in our ordering process. The benefits of these actions can be seen in our inventory turnover improvements and the fact that our in-stocks are at record high levels. As we move toward the fall, we\u2019re excited about several new product launches in our holiday offering that will be set at the end of the third quarter. We also have several outstanding special buys planned, starting with our current \u201cVanity Insanity\u201d bath event going on now. Customers are responding very well to this event, and you should come into our stores and check it out. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you Craig, and hello everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $19.4 billion, a 1.8% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 1.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.6% in May, positive 3.9% in June, and positive 1% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 1% for the quarter, with U.S. comps as negative 0.9% in May, positive 3.7% in June, and positive 0.4% in July. Please note that in 2010, Memorial Day weekend fell in our June, rather than our May, reporting period. Our gross margin was 33.9% for the quarter, an increase of 41 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business contributed 36 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, driven primarily by the following factors: First, stronger sales in certain categories drove us to higher purchasing tiers, and allowed us to earn more co-op and rebate dollars than last year. Second, we experienced lower markdowns than last year, due to better management of our seasonal categories, as well as fewer promotions. Finally, our international businesses contributed 5 basis points of gross margin expansion, due primarily to higher rebates and lower shrink than last year. Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 53 basis points to 23.4%. Adjusting for the strategic charges taken in the second quarter of 2009, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 43 basis points from last year. Our operating leverage reflects positive same-store sales as well as lower expenses in the following areas: First, we saw 14 basis points of payroll leverage arising from the nature of our spring hiring. You will recall that we pulled forward spring hiring into the first quarter and this, coupled with the higher mix of seasonal and part time workers, contributed to the payroll leverage in the second quarter. Second, we realized 13 basis points of leverage from lower depreciation expense, reflecting our smaller fixed asset base. Finally, we saw 14 basis points of leverage in our general and administrative expenses, due primarily to the rationalization of our management structure and a resulting decrease in incentive compensation. For 2010, we expected our expenses to increase by a factor of 50% of our sales growth rate. For the first six months of the year, we were on our expense rule of thumb as adjusted expenses increased by 1.8% compared to adjusted sales growth of 3.6%. We expect to see some expense relief in the back half of the year, so we now believe that our expenses for the year will grow at a factor of less than 50% of sales growth. Interest and other expense for the second quarter totaled $148 million, down $13 million from last year, reflecting lower levels of outstanding indebtedness. Our income tax provision rate was 37.3% in the second quarter, reflecting the timing of state tax settlements. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. Earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.72, up 9.1% from last year, and reflect $0.02 of benefit arising from our share repurchase program. Now moving to our operational metrics, during the second quarter we opened one new store in Mexico and closed one store in China for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the second quarter were $328, up roughly 2% year over year. Now turning to the balance sheet, we continue to effectively manage our inventory. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $10.8 billion, down $38 million from a year ago. On a per-store basis, inventory decreased by 0.5%. Inventory turns were 4.4 times, up from 4.3 times a year ago. We ended the quarter with $42.5 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion in cash. This is an increase of approximately $974 million in cash from the end of fiscal 2009, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $3.4 billion, offset by $1.2 billion used for share repurchases, $793 million used for dividends, and $407 million of capital expenditures. Now on the capital structure front, a few items of note. First, in the second quarter, we repurchased $700 million, or 21.4 million shares, of outstanding stock. Second, during the quarter we replaced our $3.25 billion commercial paper program with a new $2 billion commercial paper program that is 100% backstopped by committed, long-term bank line of credits. As of the end of the second quarter, we had no outstanding commercial paper. Third, computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 11.5%, 220 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2009. And finally, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes that came due on August 15, and expect to refinance them later this quarter. As Frank mentioned, we executed well during the first half of the year, but economic recovery is progressing at a slower pace than we originally expected, as illustrated by the Fed\u2019s recent change to its GDP outlook for 2010. You will recall that our plan assumed we would see ticket growth in the back half of the year. We now think that ticket growth will not materialize, and that our sales growth will come from transaction growth. We believe the back half of the year will resemble the first half of the year, which, when backing out the commodity price inflation we experienced in the first half, suggests back-half sales growth in the 2% area. Based on our year to date results, and our current expectations for the back half of the year, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2010. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase by approximately 2.6%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing by approximately 22.6% to $1.90. Within this guidance, we now expect our operating margin to be approximately 8.3% for the year. This guidance includes the benefit of our year to date share repurchases, but doesn\u2019t include the impact of any additional share repurchases. It is our intent, however, to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010. So thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call, and operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions.] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: In terms of your gross margin performance, which was extremely impressive, how should we think about the impact of the merchandising tools on the performance in the quarter?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, let me break down the gross margin expansion for you in the U.S. and then Craig, you can talk about the tools. But if you look at the 36 basis points of expansion that we had in the quarter, 16 basis points came from higher co-op and rebate dollars as we entered in new purchasing tiers, 12 basis points came from lower markdowns given our better management of seasonal, and then 8 basis points came from fewer promotions, and those were primarily credit promotions. So you can see we got a good deal of benefit from markdowns, and Craig you might want to talk about the tools.\nCraig Menear: We continue to work to enhance our assortment planning utilizing our merchandising tools to try to get the right product in the right place. Obviously the advantage when we do that is not only a sales advantage, by having the right product there, but also it allows us to effectively move in and out of the inventory, which saves on the markdowns and really helps us drive the overall gross margin productivity in a particular product category. And as Carol mentioned, you can see the benefit in the markdown line.\nDeborah Weinswig: And then Frank, you\u2019ve talked a lot about your customer FIRST program, and how that\u2019s really improving your customer service in the stores. Can you talk about some of the metrics behind that, and what you\u2019ve noticed over time as that program has continued to develop?\nFrank Blake: Marvin Ellison is here, so I\u2019ll ask Marvin to address that. Marvin?\nMarvin Ellison: What we\u2019ve seen is a continued increase in our internal customer satisfaction scores. We are benefitted by having about a half a million customer surveys per month that we get in when customers log on and tell us what we think, and we\u2019re in a great position because our customers are very passionate, so they tell us what they like and what they don\u2019t like. As a result of that, we\u2019ve had our net promoter score increase over 500 basis points in Q2, and that\u2019s on top of a 1,000 basis point increase in Q2 of last year. We\u2019re also seeing things like likelihood to recommend, which is our version of intent to return. It is at record highs for the company, as high as it\u2019s ever been in the eight years that I\u2019ve been here. So we feel really good about it. As Frank mentioned, what we\u2019re going to do in the second half is put an increased emphasis on checkout. We still know that that\u2019s one of our Achilles\u2019 heels from a service standpoint. We want to speed up our checkout process and make it more inviting for the customers, and we\u2019re also going to put a specific emphasis on pro and service, because we know that when we provide quicker in and out service for our contractors, then we have a chance to grow market share.\nDeborah Weinswig: In an environment where obviously traffic trends have been difficult, but you\u2019re obviously significantly outperforming, would you \u2013 there\u2019s obviously a lot of initiatives on your plate, but would you say that this is one of the keys to driving strong traffic in your stores?\nMarvin Ellison: Absolutely. Craig and I talk a lot about a real simple equation, and that is having compelling value from the merchants to create footsteps, and then the engagement of the associate to the customer turns those footsteps into transactions. And we think that as we\u2019ve increased our product knowledge, we\u2019ve increased our training on engagement, we\u2019ve seen the trajectory in transactions start to go up and continue to stay positive. But it\u2019s a combination of compelling value from the merchandising team that invites the customers in, but when we engage those customers we turn those footsteps into transactions, and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on that in the second half.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And if I could just jump in, it really is a team effort, because looking at our in-stocks, our in-stocks are at record high levels, so when you\u2019ve got great value, great service, and the product is in stock, that certainly drives transactions.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: I guess two questions. The first, how are you thinking about forecasting sales as it relates to the macro backdrop of the volatility that we\u2019ve seen in housing activity. All of us share the sales outlook that you put out there, but the drivers are a lot less obvious given the housing stimulus in existing home sales, moving up and down with unprecedented volatility. So what\u2019s the basis for your assumption that sales growth stays level over the course of the year, other than it has, essentially, held this level for the past several months?\nFrank Blake: It\u2019s a great question and we obviously spend a lot of time working through how do we forecast the back half. And if you take into account what Craig was saying, in terms of the shift, first quarter and second quarter, in garden, you go, okay, overall you start with first half came in ahead of where we expected. Second half was \u2013 but the geography of the half was not what we expected, and that was driven overwhelmingly by the shift in garden, pull-forward in the first quarter and a bit of a draining in the second quarter. And then you go, okay, we\u2019ve seen continuing strength in transactions across the business, which is a good sign across the business, and say that we think that projects forward into the back half. And then as Carol was saying, you \u2013 we\u2019re lightening our assumptions on ticket growth in large part because the pros are a little slower to come back than we thought, and that gets the equation of around the 2% sales growth. And that\u2019s the thought process. I can tell you behind that we do a lot of things as you can imagine, we keep talking about private fixed residential investment, and that\u2019s had a great correlation up until recently with our sales. The difficulty with that, and you hit on it, is a lot of the broader macro numbers actually change pretty quickly. So if you just looked at quarter over quarter over quarter, what our projects on PFRI were, or what the expert projections on PFRI were, they have changed quite dramatically over the course of the last year. So that does make forecasting in this environment a little challenging.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: But I think you gain confidence based on how you\u2019re performing. And while it\u2019s early, as we look at ourselves in August, we are on our plan and August sales are better than July.\nMatthew Fassler: That\u2019s helpful color. One follow up if I may, and that relates to the appliance category. What\u2019s your sense of how your share transpired in major appliances in Q2 versus Q1? I know that the stimulus programs were still alive, albeit at a much diminished rate, in the second quarter. Any color you could give on trends in that business would be helpful.\nCraig Menear: When you look at Q2 as reported by an independent third party, we actually stepped backwards about 60 basis points in Q2 on a rolling 12-month basis points were up 80 basis points in the appliance business from that same survey.\nMatthew Fassler: Any sense as to whether [that relates to] promotional stance, inventory, any marketing, anything that you could put your finger on?\nCraig Menear: We, as you know, we\u2019ve talked about the fact that our appliance business \u2013 we\u2019re very comfortable with our appliance business as to how it\u2019s positioned inside of our portfolio strategy. We\u2019re the third player in this business. We\u2019re comfortable being the third player in this business. During the quarter we very purposely elected not to chase some deep discounts that happened in the market.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: First question, just some clarity on some of the comp numbers you gave. Do you have an estimate for what the shift in Memorial Day might have meant for the May versus June comp? And then secondly, can you just clarify the 200 basis point swing. Is that essentially the delta between first quarter and second quarter that you saw from seasonal?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, to answer your first question, there was a 70 basis point impact in both May and June. So in other words, May \u2013 and I\u2019m talking the U.S. obviously \u2013 May would have been 70 basis points less negative and June would have been 70 basis points less positive. Then in terms of the seasonal shift, I think that was Craig\u2019s comment?\nCraig Menear: Yeah, it was 200 basis points for all of our outdoor categories that actually was impacted in the quarter comparatively to the first.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: So if you just want to work the math, you start with a 3.3% positive comp in the first quarter, and then deduct from that 200 basis points, add to that 40 basis points from air cooling.\nCraig Menear: To get you back to the comp.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Exactly.\nDennis McGill: Okay, so same adjustment both quarters. And then secondly, I\u2019m not sure if I interpreted your comments correctly, but the paint category sounded like it was still positive, but maybe below average, and I would have thought with some of your repair and remodel comments that that would have still been a strong category for you. So can you just elaborate on what you guys are seeing in that category?\nCraig Menear: The paint category was in fact still positive, although not quite as strong as it was in the first quarter, as we comped over the introduction of our [unintelligible] from a year ago. So we still feel very solid about our paint business, an area that we remain focused on overall.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan.\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: First a follow up question on the top line and then one on the gross margin. As you think about the pro, you\u2019re saying now it\u2019s kind of flat to slightly up in the back half. How are you thinking about that? Is that basically saying, hey, look, if I just look at roughly a three-year or maybe even a four-year trend and saying if we just keep comping those negative compares does that imply getting towards a flat level? Or is there some sort of indebted acceleration as you think about it?\nFrank Blake: First off, it\u2019s more the former than the latter. So if you think about the commentary that we\u2019ve had on the pro over the last several calls, we changed the way we measure it. We think we\u2019ve got a more accurate measurement of who our pro customers are. As we improve the accuracy of the measurement one of the things we found was a double-digit decline in the pro business as you exited the back half of 2008 and through 2009, gradually improving to where we\u2019re now in the low negative single digit on pro sales in our stores. We had anticipated in the back half a more significant recovery, in large part for exactly the reason you said. You just looked at your stack comparisons and now just based on the performance in the second quarter we see that as more gradually getting to flat and then slightly positive.\nChristopher Horvers: So no acceleration, just basically \u2013\nFrank Blake: Not really. It\u2019s largely just on the comparisons and kid of grinding through some bad numbers and getting to better.\nChristopher Horvers: And then on the SG&A side, Carol, you talked about less than 50% ratio to sales growth for the year. Can you talk about, maybe more granularly, what that means for the back half and what levers are there that get you to those levels? Are you taking cost out? Is it incentive comp comparisons? How are you forecasting labor, and so forth?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: If you look at our expenses on an adjusted basis, dollar expenses were actually down in the first half, and as we look at the back half we expect dollar expenses to be down again. Why? Well, the biggest driver of that is incentive compensation, and it\u2019s all based on relative performance. We\u2019re paid off of plan. Last year we smashed our plan. This year we\u2019re expecting to be on our plan, so the dollars are down year on year. The other driver for the back half of the year has to do with vacation, sick, and holiday, and given the nature of our staffing in our stores, we have less vacation, sick, and holiday expense forecasted for the back half of the year than we did last year.\nChristopher Horvers: And that\u2019s the part-time, full-time mix?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It is.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lasser with Barclays Capital.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 Barclays Capital: We\u2019ve heard from several retailers that consumer spending seems to be more event-driven right now, particularly for discretionary items, and in the second quarter you had Memorial Day, Father\u2019s Day, and the fourth of July. What sort of trends did you see around those events, and then in between the periods, and how does that impact how you think about the third quarter when there will be fewer events in that period?\nCraig Menear: Certainly a lot of focus and effort goes into the holiday periods, because those are big sales weeks for retailers, and we were very pleased with the results that we saw around those events. But when we look at the fundamentals of the business and what customers are doing right now, customers are remaining focused on maintaining their homes, so repair and maintenance categories are pretty stable across the business. We have been keenly focused on making sure that we are providing the right offerings for our customers in those day to day activities as well as simple d\u00e9cor updates. So categories like faucets, and paint, and simple flooring projects are where we\u2019re focused. And that is the foundation, as I mentioned in my comments, to our transactions and really keeping customers coming into the Home Depot. As we look to the back half we think that customers will remain there. They\u2019ll remained focused not only in their yards. I think there\u2019s certainly some stress that yards have been through in the second quarter, so there\u2019s an opportunity there. But we also think that they\u2019ll continue to focus on the maintenance and repair and simple updates around their home. So we feel like we\u2019re well positioned for the back half against what we believe customers will actually be doing.\nMichael Lasser: So just to clarify, it wasn\u2019t as though you saw a big spike in your comp around the holidays and then things drop off in between?\nCraig Menear: No. Again, we performed well on the holidays, and the holiday periods would be above a typical week. Again, put more marketing, more effort behind it, but it\u2019s not like a dramatic \u2013\nFrank Blake: But Michael, in answer to your question, it didn\u2019t seem any more spiky this year than it has in prior years.\nMichael Lasser: Okay, then as a quick follow up, were there any other categories that you found to be excessively promotional during the period, that you chose not to participate, might have impacted the relative performance of those categories?\nCraig Menear: No, I wouldn\u2019t say that there was a ton of activity outside of the appliances that I mentioned.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Chick with FBR.\nStephen Chick - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: You mentioned that the second quarter sales assumptions were \u2013 sorry second half \u2013 were similar to the first half if you normalize for inflation. And I think you had said that the first quarter inflation in the comps was about 100 basis points. What was the second quarter?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: The commodity inflation was 100 basis points for the quarter and for the half.\nStephen Chick: So it was 100 basis points again in this quarter?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes.\nStephen Chick: And sorry Craig, the math that \u2013 the 200 basis points math in the shift that you went through, I\u2019m sorry to make you guys go through that again. But can \u2013 I didn\u2019t quite grasp \u2013 if you could reconcile that again for us it would be helpful.\nCraig Menear: So, if you look at U.S. comps at 3.3 in the first quarter, you take the seasonal businesses, which fell 200 basis points, gets you down to 1.3. Add in 40 basis points of air cooling product, which was a plus. Gets you back to the 1.7 comp.\nStephen Chick: Okay, but the 1.7 comp is the total company, not the U.S., was one for the quarter, right?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: The U.S. comp was 1% for the quarter. So Craig is just tying you out to the 1.7. There\u2019s another 70 basis points of shift in the business, if you will, to get you to the reported 1% for the U.S.\nStephen Chick: Okay, so as we work into the second half, more importantly, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve kind of thought about the fourth quarter. If we keep the 200 \u2013 2% transaction count comp, let\u2019s say we assume that you get back to \u2013 or you\u2019re 2% for each quarter, the fourth quarter is a pretty tough compare. Canada had a pretty good tough comparison a year ago, I think both in terms of FX as well as the strength of the business. So is there \u2013 are you thinking about maybe the third quarter being higher than the fourth, or should we think about it being pretty even at two apiece?\nFrank Blake: I\u2019d say we\u2019re thinking about it as kind of even over the two quarters, without a doubt. As you said, there\u2019s a bigger hill in the fourth quarter, because you saw stronger numbers from us in the fourth quarter of 2009. I would say on the other hand, all of these things are comparisons, so you\u2019ve got to look fourth quarter previously and so we see them as balancing out and we have taken into account, obviously Canada we saw significant improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly the last month in Canada last year.\nStephen Chick: And does the mix of small versus large transactions change much, Craig? The 20% and 20%? Can we think about that being [unintelligible] mix in the second half?\nCraig Menear: Yeah, it\u2019s pretty flat. That number doesn\u2019t change dramatically quarter to quarter.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from David Schick with Stifel Nicolaus.\nDavid Schick - Stifel Nicolaus: First question is I think for Craig. You talked about the pro business remaining sluggish and limiting the ticket. Is there any evidence as you look at it that the DIY customer is rethinking the good better best spectrum within a category as they\u2019re purchasing?\nCraig Menear: No, actually we\u2019re \u2013 again it varies by product category, but we\u2019re seeing kind of a typical buying pattern throughout the line structure in categories. As I mentioned in my comments, we actually improved our offerings in, for example, our tool storage at the upper end. That was very well received by the customers. If you look at the Ryobi Lithium and cordless, which is actually at the top end of our cordless offering in our outdoor power equipment, for a cordless category that has performed extremely well. Likewise, we\u2019ve also made sure the customer\u2019s focused on value across all of the line segments. So we\u2019re trying to strengthen each of the areas as we did, for example, in hand tools. We actually went at both ends of the business and saw good results.\nDavid Schick: And I guess this question\u2019s a little bit circular given your comments at the end, Carol, but the buyback. You\u2019ve always talked about a more, maybe I\u2019m adding the word regular, but a regular and substantial buyback when you saw a stabilization in the business and you stepped it up in the quarter. You talked about it \u2013 you\u2019ll do it with excess cash flows, but is this the sort of pace we should expect going forward on average? Or absolutely? Or will there be a lot of volatility? Or am I thinking about that wrong?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: At the beginning of the year we said based on our forecast of cash, that we could see us buying about $3 billion worth of shares in 2010. We bought $1.2 to date, so that\u2019s about 40% of the program. As I mentioned on the call, we needed to save some cash in our bank account to repay the bonds. This is just a timing thing. We\u2019re going to refinance those senior notes later this quarter. So you should expect us to go back into the market. We will start repurchasing shares and as much as $3 billion this year in a thoughtful, planful way.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets: I guess I had a follow up comment regarding, or question, regarding the cadence for the second half sales. And I guess the question is essentially why do you expect comps will accelerate in the fourth quarter? Because it looks to me like you would need a fairly meaningful improvement even on a three year run rate basis. And I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out what is it about the business that\u2019s going to get quite a bit better in the fourth quarter?\nFrank Blake: It\u2019s not an enormous step forward. I think what you say is the business \u2013 you have to start with the fundamental that you think the business is turning. You go okay, you\u2019re going to maintain your comp transactions growth. We think we\u2019ve got some plans in place across our business that will continue to drive growth into the fourth quarter. For every turn \u2013 I mean as the business turns you\u2019re going to hit a point where you go, gee, I\u2019m lapping where it started to turn last year, can I sustain it? And so our task is to sustain that turn? But if you said, hey, yeah, the numbers mathematically, it\u2019s harder in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, the [comment] is not arguable.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Many retailers are talking about holiday sales as perhaps challenging this year. Holiday\u2019s not big for us, but we think we\u2019re going to have a good holiday season.\nScot Ciccarelli: And then just a quick follow up. Given that it\u2019s in hindsight now do you guys have any color on what the impact of the housing tax credit may have been on your business? When you saw that expire was there a change either in terms of quantification or what people were buying?\nFrank Blake: On the quantification side we really don\u2019t have that, and I would say it\u2019s going to take another couple of quarters for us to figure it out. We\u2019re now going into a period where for the first time we\u2019re going to be having a few quarters without federal tax credits that apply to the housing related activity. We feel qualitatively that there was a pull-forward. Hard to know what it was, whether there was some incremental sales, pull forward, what\u2019s the division between them? I\u2019d say we\u2019re really going to have to wait until the end of the year to have a clearer picture on quantitatively what that was.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from David Strasser with Janney Montgomery and Scott.\nDavid Strasser \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott: Two questions. First of all, Canada. And the reason I ask this is because Walmart said something very similar this morning, and it seemed like Canada has slowed down, particularly the west coast of Canada, which has been such as strong part of your business for a while. As you think about it into the back half of the year and think about inventory replenishment in particular in the western part of it, do you sense a trend there? Or do you think it\u2019s a somewhat short lived issue there?\nFrank Blake: As I mentioned, it is interesting because we see both what was happening in the northwest part of the U.S. as well as what was happening in the western part of Canada, and an awful lot of it was just straight \u2013 you\u2019d hate to say the weather word \u2013 but an awful lot of it in the second quarter was just a straight weather impact.\nDavid Strasser: Okay, because just hearing it from Walmart as well it just jumped out a little bit.\nFrank Blake: I\u2019m sure there are probably other retailers that experienced the same thing, but we had strength in the eastern part of Canada, which would, again, suggest if you normalize for weather, the country as a whole was okay.\nDavid Strasser: And it\u2019s also the first time I\u2019d heard it, so that was logical. Second question, Carol you said that August got a little bit better from July. Anything particular that seemed to accelerate? Was it weather related, you think, August getting better? Any other ways to think about that trend?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It\u2019s early days. It has cooled off a little bit in parts of the country. And as Craig mentioned we\u2019ve got \u201cVanity Insanity\u201d inside our stores, so you should go check it out.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: I\u2019d like to just focus a little bit on gross margin. Carol, I think you said that you had 16 basis points from rebates in this quarter and 12 basis points from lower markdowns and 8 from fewer promotions. How should we think about that going forward? Will the rebates continue, and the fewer promotions continue? What do you think about gross margin for the second half?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: At the beginning of the year we told you to expect modest growth margin expansion for the full year. We\u2019re up 40 basis points for the first half on an adjusted basis. I would say 40 is a little bit more than modest, so look for gross margin expansion in the back half, but not at the same level that we experienced in the first half.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Daniel Binder with Jeffries.\nDaniel Binder \u2013 Jeffries: Just curious with the Fed guidelines on the credit cards and your profit sharing arrangement if there was any benefit or detriment as a result of those new guidelines on your credit income.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, gosh, lots of things have happened, haven\u2019t they, as it relates to credit cards in our country. Our cost of credit is capped at no more than 1.5% of credit sales, and currently we\u2019re running slightly under that. But we are seeing something interesting in terms of the behavior of the card holders, and that really relates to the change that happened earlier this year with the CARD Act, where the everyday value proposition that we used to offer, which was if you spent $299 on the card it was no interest, no payments for six months. That\u2019s now changed to no interest, minimum payment for six months. And what we\u2019ve seen is a decline in the penetration of usage of our private label card. Actually, in the second quarter it declined almost 400 basis points to now just 21% of our sales. So as we think about this, private label is a great value proposition. It\u2019s the cheapest form of credit for us. We want more customers to use our card. So we do have a program inside our stores called \u201cEveryday Savings\u201d, which on certain everyday items like light bulbs, and trash bags, and air filters, if you use our card it\u2019s every day 10% off. So we\u2019re doing a number of things to drive up penetration, but in terms of our cost, we don\u2019t anticipate any change. Now I could comment, if you\u2019d like, on the Durbin Amendment to the financial reform bill. The Durbin Amendment speaks to interchange fees on debit cards. Debit is about 18% of total penetration for our business, and there is PIN debit and signature debit. PIN debit is cheap, signature debit is expensive. It cost more than clearing a check. With the Durbin Amendment the Federal Reserve has been given the right to determine what the fees should be on a reasonable and proportionate basis. We think that when those fees come out there could be a benefit to our company next year beginning in July, and that benefit could be in the $30 million area, which we could then turn around and reduce retail prices, or make investments in other areas.\nDaniel Binder: That\u2019s great color. I was just curious with that 400 basis point reduction in penetration of the private label card, has your overall credit penetration come down?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Overall credit penetration has dropped 100 basis points. So bank cards picked up 300 of the 400 decline. But penetration is down.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Just a follow up question on expenses. I think consecutively you\u2019ve not only done well in the quarters but continue to find ways to reduce the growth rate of your expenses below the growth rate of sales. And we\u2019re obviously in a pretty uncertain environment here. If things do tend to trend down, how much more juice is there in that stone? What are remaining areas that you could still go after to take more expenses out of the business after all the success you\u2019ve had?\nFrank Blake: I\u2019d say that there are always opportunities. The challenge in our business is how we use things like technology to help us approach things more efficiently and effectively. Embedded in the numbers that Carol was going through was a number of examples like that where we think we\u2019ve been able to reduce structure, use technology, and provide a better outcome. There are things that we\u2019re working on even as we speak, that would do the same thing. And to be clear, we\u2019d work on those if the conditions were great, or harsh, because they\u2019re the right thing to do for the business, and we think they actually improve the business. So there are still, I can tell you we\u2019ve got a lot of projects that are going on that we think help take expense out of the business long term.\nColin McGranahan: And then a follow up question for Carol. It looks like on a gross basis, so gross debt to EBITDAR is now down to just a touch over two times, and net debt to EBITDAR by our model is about 1.75 times, I think a bit below where your target leverage ratios are. Obviously it\u2019s a period of uncertainty, but at the same time it\u2019s a period of relatively cheap debt financing. So how are you thinking about the right leverage in the business and when you might get closer to a target leverage ratio, and what that might mean for the stock buyback going forward?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: First of all, we agree with your calculation. Secondly, it\u2019s important just to reiterate that we will maintain our strong investment-grade rating of BBB+, and our target adjusted to EBITDAR ratio of 2.5 allows us to maintain that rating. So we are under it. We could lever up right now about $3 billion and still stay under that target, but to your point, Colin, it is a time of uncertainty. So we don\u2019t feel compelled to go to market, even though interest rates are very low, because with the Fed\u2019s announcement last week that they\u2019re going to keep the size of their balance sheet for the foreseeable future, it doesn\u2019t appear to us that rates will be moving in the near term.\nDiane Dayhoff: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Well take our next question from Gregory Melich with ISI.\nGregory Melich \u2013 ISI: Two questions. One is getting back to the point on pro, and the expected improvement in the pro. What percentage of those larger tickets, the $500 tickets, are pros at this point under that new definition? And I wanted to follow up to that.\nFrank Blake: Don\u2019t know. [Laughter.] So I\u2019d like to be able to give you the answer to that with that granularity, but we don\u2019t know.\nGregory Melich: So maybe looked at a different way?\nFrank Blake: Yeah.\nGregory Melich: If you look at the cadence you expect in the pro, which at least is less negative turning slightly positive?\nFrank Blake: Yeah.\nGregory Melich: We assume the pro is higher ticket.\nFrank Blake: Yeah, exactly right.\nGregory Melich: So that is still getting better on a year over year basis, and I guess what I\u2019m wondering is are we then implicitly assuming if ticket\u2019s going to remain weak that non-pro ticket is actually going to deteriorate.\nFrank Blake: No, no. I think the right way to think about it is really our planning assumption is, look, the ticket remains under pressure. And it remains under pressure because the recovery of the pro is slower than we thought, and so exactly when the time is that the pro turns to positive, I can\u2019t tell you. But what I can tell you from our planning is that where we had been thinking we\u2019d see some improvement on ticket, and if you go back to our call in February, we were talking about the back half more of a blend between ticket and transaction in terms of what would drive the comp. And what we\u2019re saying now is no, that\u2019s really going to be transaction and not ticket. And the big difference there is pro, so I think don\u2019t be thinking there\u2019s some significant lift we\u2019re anticipating from pro that\u2019s going to be offset by some significant decrease in the consumer. The bigger thing to take away is that pro is slower.\nMarvin Ellison: We\u2019re going to be aggressive and opportunistic with the pro customers. We\u2019re going to focus on staffing and service levels and getting them in and out really quick, which is a mandate that they\u2019ve given us. We have a field team that is out there building relationships, understanding the needs of the pro. We\u2019re working with Craig\u2019s team to make sure we\u2019re merchandized the right way, we\u2019re priced the right way. So we\u2019re going to fight as hard as we can to take care of the customers. But again, as Frank said, we just don\u2019t anticipate robust growth in the second half.\nGregory Melich: Right, and then a follow up on the gross margin side. Carol you talked a bit about \u2013 and thanks for the exact numbers on mix and markdown \u2013 it does sound like those things will start to fade. Could you answer what was in the quarter in terms of supply chain benefits to gross margin, even if they didn\u2019t show up? Was there a benefit that we just didn\u2019t see that we\u2019ll see more into next year? When does that start to be a net positive?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We\u2019re going to see the supply chain benefit next year. We didn\u2019t talk much about supply chain although they\u2019re doing a great job of driving the business. We had some cost pressure, as you can appreciate, with some cost coming out of international carriage. I think many retailers were faced with a similar challenge. But through our excellent productivity and our distribution [system], we were able to offset a lot of that cost. So no material impact to the quarter, and you should see the benefits next year.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you to everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you on our next quarterly earnings conference call.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Beginning today\u2019s discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDiane Dayhoff:  Thank you Cindy and good morning to everyone. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks the call we open for analysts\u2019 questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors, and as a reminder we would appreciate if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow up, please. This conference call is being broadcast real time on the Internet at earnings.homedepot.com. The replay will also be available on our site. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations Department at 770-384-2387.  Now before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentations also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided in the financial statements included with our earnings release. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake:  Thank you Diane and good morning everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $16.9 billion, up 4.3% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.8% and our diluted earnings per share were $0.43. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 3.3%. This represents the first quarter of positive comps for the U.S. since the fourth quarter of 2005. From a geographic perspective, all but three of our top 40 U.S. markets positively comped in the first quarter, and all of our regions positively comped except the Gulf region which is still impacted by hurricane related comparisons. We also had a return to positive comps in Florida and California. Overall sales were better than we planned for the quarter, and we continue to focus on improving our underlying business performance. As Craig and Carol will describe in more detail, for the quarter, we levered our operating expenses in line with our targets; improved our gross margin rate through better assortment management; and improved inventory turns. We also made significant progress on our key infrastructure initiatives. We opened our 13th rapid deployment center or RDC in Columbia, South Carolina. RDCs now serve 70% of our U.S. stores and we\u2019re on track to reach our goal of serving 100% by the end of the year. It\u2019s important that our supply chain team is on track on the network build-out. It\u2019s even more important that they maintain that schedule as they also improve the performance at the existing facilities. This spring season has seen some unusually erratic weather from record snow in the mid-Atlantic to unseasonably warm temperatures in April in New England. The flexibility and responsiveness of the supply chain were critical in meeting these changing needs. We improved our inventory turns in the quarter and improved our targeted in stock levels during a challenging season. Craig and the merchandising team continued to integrate new merchandising tools as part of the overall merchandising transformation. For example, over the last three years we have steadily increased the portion of SKUs that are on centralized, automated replenishment. This year we began the process of upgrading the tools used for the centralized forecasting systems. These tools significantly improved the accuracy of the forecasting for seasonal products during the first quarter. Based on this success, we\u2019ll be migrating centrally automated SKUs to the new forecasting tools by the end of the second quarter. Marvin and the store operations team worked to continue to improve the customer service levels in our stores. Last year, as we described, we re-trained every associate in the company on our customer service expectations, what we call our Customer First program. This year we repeated and refreshed that training to emphasize that this isn\u2019t a temporary program, but part of our ongoing commitment. We\u2019ve seen consistent improvement in our net promoter score since we initiated Customer First, and it was particularly significant that we again saw an improvement in the first quarter, 600 basis points over last year, even as our transactions increased 4.2%. On the international front, our Canadian business delivered a positive comp and significantly improved its overall business performance. Last year\u2019s first quarter was negatively impacted by the major ERP implementation we undertook in Canada. That is now behind us. Our Mexican business also had another solid quarter, with single digit positive comps, and our team in Mexico is helping on a number of U.S., Hispanic focused efforts. For example, our head of marketing in Mexico helped lead our review of Hispanic marketing in the U.S. In China, our business performed to plan as we continue to refine our business model for that country.  So there were a number of positives for us in the quarter, but there were also signs of caution. Over the last several years we\u2019ve looked at private fixed residential investment, PFRI, as a percent of GDP as a useful benchmark. The most recent PFRI data showed a decline, reversing its pattern of improvement over the prior two quarters. The good news is that that obviously our results didn\u2019t track with PFRI results. This may be an indicator that the PFRI data will have less correlation to results as the home improvement market recovers. But we\u2019re also mindful that a significant part of our growth in the first quarter came from seasonal consumer spending. Our data analytics did not show positive comp growth from our pro customers. The rate of decline was low single digit so there was improvement, but this core part of our business has still not returned to positive growth. To date, this is consistent with our expectation that average ticket will lag the growth in transactions. As Carol will describe in more detail, we have increased our earnings per share and sales guidance for the year based on our outperformance to plan in the first quarter. I want to thank our associates for all their hard work in the first quarter. Based on this quarter\u2019s results, over 95% of our stores would be eligible for [successionary], our profit sharing program for hourly associates. With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear:  Thanks Frank and good morning everyone. We had a strong quarter compared to our expectations and we saw encouraging signs. First, a solid, broad based transaction performance across the store; second, the seasonal businesses performed well, leveraging the supply chain capabilities and merchandising tools developed over the last few years; and third, our core repair and maintenance business remains strong. As anticipated, the challenge in the first quarter continued to be big ticket, which remains under pressure from both the pro and discretionary spend.  On a departmental business, every department posted positive comps for the quarter. Garden, lumber, paint, electrical and lighting outperformed the company\u2019s average comp for the quarter. Plumbing, building materials, hardware, flooring, kitchen and bath and mill work, while positive, were under the company average comp for the quarter. From a commodities standpoint, we did experience inflation in lumber and copper in the quarter which positively impacted U.S. comp sales by approximately 100 basis points. As you may be aware, structural panel and framing lumber prices are up substantially from a year ago due to supply constraints.  Overall, total customer transactions were $323 million, up 4.2% compared to last year. This is our largest year-over-year increase since the fourth quarter of 2005. Our total comp transactions increased by 4.4%. The seasonal business was a key driver to this performance, and with the exception of kitchens, we saw transaction growth in all our businesses. Transactions for tickets [inaudible] $50, roughly 20% of the business in the U.S., were up 4.7% in the first quarter. As we have seen for several quarters, the simple d\u00e9cor and general repair businesses have remained resilient and been contributors to transaction growth. General repair continues to perform well with categories like caulk, safety and security, roofing, pipe and fittings all exceeding the company average comp performance. Simple d\u00e9cor projects like paint, faucets and ceramic tile all had positive comps, and are examples of the continued strength that we see in these small project categories. As I mentioned earlier, our seasonal businesses also performed well, and our enhanced supply chain and merchandising tools allowed us to meet the demand throughout the quarter. Landscape, live goods, fertilizer and chemicals all performed positively as customers were excited to get outdoors and take on simple DIY projects to spruce up their yards. Grills, portable power, walk behind mowers, patios, all posted double digit positive comps in the quarter. Our spring selling period represents a highly variable portion of our business, and our tools enabled us to have the right products in the right place at the right time. For the last three years, Mark Holifield and his team have been working to optimize our supply chain and replenishment capabilities, resulting in shorter lead times and improved in stock rates. As Frank mentioned, we implemented an enhanced replenishment forecasting tool for all of our seasonal categories. The next step is to drive space planning integration. This effort will link our assortment maintenance, forecasting and Plan-O-Gramming tools to our replenishment system.  While we\u2019re pleased with our first quarter results, we have yet to see a clear recovery in our pro business or big ticket discretionary categories such as special order kitchens. These factors continue to pressure our comp average ticket during the quarter, which was down 1.3% to $52.01 in the U.S. retail. Our total company average ticket was flat to last year, and on a comp basis was up 0.4%. In the U.S. transactions for tickets $900 and above, which represent approximately 20% of sales, were down 1.4%. While still negative, our pro business is showing signs of improvement. In fact, we saw positive growth in some highly penetrated pro categories such as fasteners, hand tools, power tool accessories, wire and wiring devices. Recently we began to see unit improvements in categories like plywood and concrete, yet still negative for the total quarter.  We know the efforts we\u2019ve taken to improve our customer service, assortment and store environment have been resonating with our customers. Through March, our U.S. market share is up 83 basis points on a rolling 12 month basis. And to give you two examples of where share growth is coming from based on an independent third party tracking of consumer activity, we saw 140 basis points of market share gain in paint and 150 basis points of market share gain in electrical. As Frank mentioned at the beginning of this year, our expectation for 2010 is that this will be a transitional year. We expect to see greater improvement in transactions, prior to ticket recovery. We started the year off well and feel that we are well positioned to deliver on our commitment. And now I would like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9:  Thank you Craig and hello everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $16.9 billion, a 4.3% increase from last year. Excluding the $221 million of sales related to the closing of our Expo businesses during the first quarter of 2009, sales increased 5.7%. Comp or same-store sales were positive 4.8% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.2% in February; positive 5.7% in March; and positive 7% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 3.3% for the quarter, with U.S. comps of negative 1.2% in February; positive 3.9% in March; and positive 5.5% in April.  In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.4%, an increase of 67 basis points from last year. Our gross margin expansion was due to the following factors. First, our U.S. business reported 41 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, of which 12 basis points was driven by lower markdowns than last year as we saw benefits from better assortment management and fewer promotions. We also lapped markdowns taken last year as part of the closing of our Expo businesses, which negatively affected gross margin by 29 basis points in the first quarter of 2009. Second, we realized 26 basis points of margin expansion from our international businesses, principally Canada, as we lapped the disruption we experienced last year when we implemented Score, or SAP.  On a reported basis, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 102 basis points to 26.6%, but the comparison is distorted due to strategic charges taken in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the strategic charges from last year\u2019s results, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 48 basis points. Our operating leverage was primarily the result of positive same-store sales. Total expenses increased by a factor of 67% of our sales growth rate, slightly higher than our rule of thumb. But we planned for this, as we pulled forward some spring staffing and marketing expenditures. We also experienced higher bank card interchange fees due to a higher penetration of bank cards, our most expensive form of credit. We expect expense growth as a factor of sales growth to moderate throughout the balance of the year. Interest and other expense for the first quarter totaled $189 million. This includes a $51 million pretax charge related to the revaluation of our HD supply guarantee. In connection with the sale of HD Supply in 2007, we guaranteed a $1 billion senior secure amortizing term loan. In March, we agreed to an 18 month extension of our guarantee, extending it to April, 2014. Accordingly, we revalued our guarantee and increased the fair value liability by $51 million, which had a negative impact to first quarter earnings per share of $0.02.  Our income tax provision rate was 35% in the first quarter, reflecting certain favorable state tax settlements. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.  Earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.43, up 43.3% from last year. Excluding the $51 million charge taken in the first quarter of 2010, and the strategic charges taken in the first quarter of 2009, earnings per share increased 28.6% to $0.45 compared to last year\u2019s adjusted earnings per share of $0.35.  Now moving to our operational metrics, during the first quarter we opened one new store and closed one store, for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the first quarter, selling squarer footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $288, up roughly 5.4% year-over-year. Now turning to the balance sheet, inventory remains a good news story. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was $11.5 billion, up $51 million from a year ago. On a per store basis, inventory was flat to last year. Inventory turns were 4.1 times, up from 3.9 times a year ago.  We ended the quarter with $43.6 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion in cash and short term investments. This is an increase of approximately $1 billion in cash and short term investments from the end of fiscal 2009, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $2.1 billion, offset by $508 million used for share repurchases; $399 million used for dividends; and $167 million of capital expenditures. We have approximately $9.7 billion of outstanding debt of which $1 billion comes due in August of 2010. At this point, it is our intent to refinance this debt maturity. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 11.5%, 150 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2009. As Frank mentioned, we performed well against our internal expectations for the first quarter. Based on our results, we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2010. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase approximately 3.5%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing approximately 21% to $1.88. Within this guidance, we now expect our operating margin to reach approximately 8.25% for the year. Finally, we are not including the impact of any additional share repurchases, outside of those executed in the first quarter, in our earnings per share guidance, but it is our intent to continue to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010. So thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call, and Cindy we are now ready for questions.\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Christopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan.\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Carol, can you talk about your operating expense outlook? What forms the foundation of why the ratio to sales should go down over the year? And do you think by the time we get to the fourth quarter that you\u2019ll be below that 60% rule of thumb?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We do. As we started the year, we said that our sales would grow about 2.5% and that our expenses would grow at 60% of our sales growth. With our performance in the first quarter, we now think that expenses for the year will grow about 50% of our sales growth, and it\u2019s just a function of the sales environment.\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan:  And as one follow up, on the pro side can you talk about maybe some of the mill work and the roofing categories and what you\u2019re seeing there? And really as you get to the back half, what would pro have to perform at to see accelerating comps in the back half?\nCraig Menear: When we look at categories like roofing and windows, those categories have performed well in the quarter and we would need to continue to see the overall pro business continue to gain momentum. As Frank mentioned, we\u2019ve seen improvement in the pro business into a low, single digit, negative environment as we look at the pro attributes. But we are seeing improvement in categories that are heavily pro penetrated. And that would really need to continue through the back half for us to continue to show the kind of performance improvement that we\u2019re looking for.\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan:  So you would need like a low single digit positive in that business.\nFrank Blake:\n : Yes. One way to think about it is, if you just look at the trajectory of if you go through 2009, we went from double digit negative to high single digit negative to where we\u2019re now kind of low, single digit negative so our expectation is yes, that turns positive.\nCarol Tom\u00e9:  Yes.\nCraig Menear: And we continue to gain ground with our DIY customers, which still represents 70% of our business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: A little more color on the increased margin outlook for the year now, based on the numbers that you gave, Carol. Can you just talk a little bit about within gross margin and SG&A, what is driving the more optimistic outlook?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure. A couple of things. At the beginning of the year, we said we would have modest gross margin expansion. We\u2019re going to do a little bit better than that, based on the outperformance that we experienced in the first quarter. And then on the expense side, at the beginning of the year we thought expenses would grow at a factor of 60% of sales. Based on our performance in the first quarter, we now think it will be closer to 50% of our sales growth. And to put that into a different perspective, to give more color, when we built our plan we actually thought the first quarter expense growth would be higher than the 67% that we recognize. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful in understanding how we\u2019re viewing the year.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research:  Can you just go a level deeper in both of those? Why the gross margin is better and why the expense leverage is better?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well on the gross margin side, as Craig has talked about, we\u2019ve gotten new tools. And we continue to get benefit from these new tools, which allow us to have better assortment management, fewer markdowns. And Craig if you want to give some more color on that?\nCraig Menear: Sure. Eric, when you look at the seasonal business, first and foremost, we had a very solid performance in seasonal. The tools allow us to do a better job of getting the right assortment in the right places, which then obviously saves us in terms of markdowns. At the same time, as we\u2019ve worked to bring everyday great value to our customer we continue to take promotional activity out of our business, which also helps on the markdown side of the business. And then third, as we work our product line review and our assortment structure through that process, we\u2019re seeing benefit in terms of overall improvement in line structure and the gross margin dollars that that delivers when we get those category improvements.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And on the SG&A side, Eric, I think you remember that last year we did a nice job of controlling our expenses. We haven\u2019t stopped that work. We\u2019ve got cost out teams and we continue to have a laser approach on managing expenses. And with the positive sales environment, that allows us to drive more leverage.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research:  The sales performance in the quarter benefited from seasonal and I\u2019m assuming you got a little bit of benefit from the appliance stimulus. Can you just talk about how as we transition into 2Q those categories perform and what influence that might have on how 2Q sales look relative to 1Q?\nCraig Menear: Sure. We did have a strong business in our seasonal business. We do expect that to continue through the second quarter. Matter of fact, our outdoor business penetration in the second quarter is actually higher than in the first quarter. So we\u2019re looking forward to that continuing. We did have a solid performance in our appliance business overall, you know, with mid single digit growth there. We think that some of the new products that we have coming in the quarter will continue to help us drive sales in that area that, in the first quarter, was benefit from the stimulus package that was out there. We do believe that roughly 80% of that business as it relates to the rebates are probably done, as most of the big states have completed their programs, but we\u2019re very confident that in our assortment going forward and the new products that we\u2019re bringing that we think we can continue to drive that business.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I would like to give just a little bit more color on how to think about Q1 versus Q2. Because of the very nice weather that we had in the first quarter, we pulled forward some of our spring sales. So at the beginning of the year, we said that we anticipated a sequential improvement in comps, every quarter, until the fourth quarter where comps would be positive, but we were lapping double digit positive comps in Canada so it may not show a sequential improvement. As we look at what we believe we pulled forward into the first quarter, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect the second quarter to be a higher comping quarter than the first quarter, still positive, but we did pull forward some sales.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Craig, to go a step further, in your seasonal business it sounds like improved localization year-over-year, driven by the assortment management tools, did have a significant impact. Should we think about that impact being greater on sales or fewer markdowns and can you provide us a specific example?\nCraig Menear: Well, I think it\u2019s a combination. We had a very strong seasonal business overall, with double digit growth. You know, whether that was categories like power equipment, portable power equipment running strong double digits; patio, very strong; our live good business in the high single digits; our barbecue grill business is double digit positive comps. So certainly having the right assortments in the right place, making adjustments, continually year-over-year using our assortment tool we believe has allowed us to help deliver that performance. And then likewise, we\u2019re also seeing a benefit in that from a gross margin dollar productivity standpoint. And so those sales are delivering gross margin improvement, we have less markdowns in these categories. As we track sell through in them on a week-to-week basis, we\u2019re taking less markdowns as you move through the season to really drive the inventory productivity. And so it\u2019s really a benefit on both sides, Deb.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup: And then Carol, not to hammer this again, but on the SG&A front you said that total expenses increased by a factor of 67% of sales growth. Can you walk through though what expenses were levered in the quarter and then I\u2019m assuming you leveraged payroll in the quarter, but by how much was that levered?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure. Well, payroll is our largest expense, so let\u2019s start with that. We leveraged payroll by 23 basis points in the quarter. That\u2019s good. It could have been better. We pulled forward some staffing deliberately because we were having such great sales. If you look at all the other expenses, we\u2019re pretty much in line what we expected in terms of leverage. Here\u2019s where we didn\u2019t lever. We pulled forward marketing dollars in terms of advertising. We had costs associated with our Martha Stewart rollout and some other marketing expenses, if you will, about $31 million of more expense year-over-year, so we didn\u2019t lever that.  Another area that was a cost pressure for us in the first quarter was higher interchange fees associated with bank cards. We had a really interesting phenomenon happen in the first quarter, where the penetration of our private label card dropped by 400 basis points from 26% to 22% and the penetration of bank cards increased by 300 basis points from 35% to 38%. Bank cards are our highest form of tender, so that cost us about $14 million in the quarter. But generally, if I go back to all of the other expenses, they performed as we expected.\nDeborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup:  On the marketing front, we actually noticed significant innovation in your marketing in the quarter with your Black Friday and Cyber Monday advertising. Can you talk about the drivers behind the innovation? I mean that was very impressive to us, especially year-over-year.\nCraig Menear: Actually our spring marketing as it relates to spring Black Friday was kind of a repeat of what we did last year. We\u2019ve worked with our suppliers to go out and develop special buys, bringing them to the market to kick off the season for the last couple of years now. And then we have tried to work hard to integrate our online business to our store business. That\u2019s one of our initiatives that is under works. And that did perform very well for us during the quarter.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And I think that\u2019s what you saw, because we really have stepped it up a lot. And we\u2019re excited about what that online marketing opportunity presents for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Budd Bugatch - Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: My first question goes to the trajectory of sales improvement over the quarter, which is certainly heartening. Can you kind of drill down that and talk a little bit about the trajectory as it goes to discretionary and the normal repair and maintenance kind of transactions?\nFrank Blake: Well, Budd, I\u2019d say I mean one of the things definitely you see in the spring is obviously you have part of the trajectory is just weather. So, February we had obviously some tough weather as you had parts of the mid-Atlantic under snow for the first time in ages, that degree of snow. And then in April you saw some very, kind of unseasonably warm weather in parts of the northern parts of the United States. I think that that really is responsible for a lot of the variation kind of month over month.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James:  So it wasn\u2019t a major difference in ticket size or?\nFrank Blake: No.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James:  And just my follow up goes to can you talk a little bit about inventories? The inventory performance is certainly also very heartening in terms of average inventory per store and the flatness of inventory overall. Are you running into any out of stock issues or how should we think about that? And how would we model inventories now going forward?\nFrank Blake:\n : I\u2019d say our in stock performance is actually improved, so we\u2019re very pleased with that. And you know look, as I said in opening comments, really pleased. Not only is our supply chain team building out kind of a whole new supply chain mode, but at the same time, just the performance of the existing supply chain facilities, the whole replenishment process is improved.\nCraig Menear: We never look at inventory productivity without connecting that to in stock. I mean you just can\u2019t separate those two, so we measure ourselves based on the productivity of inventory against our in stock improvement.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And for this year we built a plan that shows inventory turnover improvement, much along what we experienced in the first quarter which was .2 year-over-year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jaison Blair - Rochdale Securities LLC.\nJaison Blair - Rochdale Securities LLC: I was wondering if you could just give us your thoughts on how much cash you need on the balance sheet and how you judge your options for capital allocation and whether it\u2019s boosting the dividend or the return from share repurchase. In the quarter you were building inventories yet you still generate $1 billion of cash flow from operations, yet you only purchased $500 million of common stock.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well we\u2019ve got a great model, don\u2019t we? We generate a lot of cash.\nJaison Blair - Rochdale Securities LLC:  Yes you do.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We sure do. And so the capital allocation is one of the three legs of our strategy stool how we best use this cash. And we\u2019ve got a disciplined approach, investing cash back in the business. This year we\u2019ll spend about $1.250 billion on capital. And then returning it to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As you will note, in the first quarter, well at the end of last year I should say, we increased our dividend by 5%, the first time since 2006. And Frank said that it is his intent to raise the dividend every year. So dividends are an important part of our capital distribution. Based on the guidance that we gave this morning, our payout is about 50% of our earnings.  We will then use excess cash to return it to the shareholders through share repurchases. We started our share repurchase program in the first quarter, back in the market. There\u2019s just a do-ability factor, so we bought back $500 million. We weren\u2019t signaling anything. That\u2019s how much we got done. We do have a lot of cash and it\u2019s our intent to continue to use that cash appropriately by repurchasing shares. We\u2019ll always measure the return on the share repurchase against any alternate investment of the cash, and right now we see returning it makes a lot of sense.\nJaison Blair - Rochdale Securities LLC: So you are conscious of the valuation at which you\u2019re repurchasing shares?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We are, yes, of course.\nJaison Blair - Rochdale Securities LLC:  And just as a follow up, I don\u2019t believe you mentioned the appliance business. Your competitor mentioned yesterday that other retailers had a hard time keeping up with demand. Could you just give us some thoughts on appliance, on demand and your ability to keep up with that demand?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: You know, we\u2019re the third largest player. I\u2019ll start and then Craig can jump in. We\u2019re the third largest player in appliances. We\u2019re very happy with where we play. Appliances sales had a negligible impact to our performance in the quarter year on year.\nCraig Menear: Yes, I believe the industry reported north of 8% shipments during the quarter, which is obviously a substantial improvement from where they anticipated it to be during the initial forecasts that they had for 2010. So I mean I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that some manufacturers scrambled to get product out. They added shifts or added people to their plants to try to meet the demand that existed out there. But overall I think, you know, we were very pleased with our appliance business in the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Kind of a big picture question for you, Frank. Maybe something you could pull your crystal ball out at this point and given your tracking of PFRI, what are you seeing in terms of the underlying housing dynamics? And clearly there\u2019s been some movement there around first time homebuyer credit. How you\u2019re looking at the employment situation and consumer, and maybe just talk maybe more broadly about maybe not the second quarter or even fiscal \u201910 but what your current thinking is on the trajectory of improvement in demand for your sector.\nFrank Blake: Yes. Okay. Thanks Colin. As you said on the PFRI, which we have used in the past, we were concerned that we\u2019d actually dislocate from that metric in the other direction, which is that it would show greater growth as new home sales picked up than might necessarily flow through to us. And in fact the dislocation for the first quarter occurred in the other direction, PFRI going down and we going in the opposite direction. As we look out forward, you know, basically while very strong first quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with the first quarter, but outlook is still pretty much the same as we had back in February. You see this as a transitional year with the caveat that Carol described, you know, kind of sequentially getting better up to the fourth quarter where year-over-year might take us down a little. But it\u2019s kind of slow sequential improvement over the course of the year, and then through into 2011.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC:  Just a follow up for Carol and maybe Craig, can you give us a little bit more detail on the gross margin expansion here in the first quarter? I think on a non-GAAP basis, apples to apples, we calculate about 38 basis points. What was the impact to mix, lower markdowns, any other specific drivers, shrink, etc. in terms of the improvement?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: You bet. So in the United States we had 41 basis points of margin expansion, of which 29 basis points was the Expo markdowns. So back that out, the U.S. business grew by 12 basis points. It always goes in as it goes out. We didn\u2019t have much impact by mix, interestingly. So the drivers of that 12 basis points were lower markdowns, 7 basis points; and then lower deferred interest, because we had fewer credit promotion days in the first quarter, so we had lower deferred interest and that gave 5 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets: Can you guys talk a little bit about product inflation? I know that lumber and copper and some other items are experiencing pretty significant price increases. And I guess my questions are twofold. Number one, how quickly are you changing price at the retail level? And secondly, why wouldn\u2019t we have seen an even greater impact than what we did? I mean just kind of the back of the envelope says just from lumber alone, lumber was up about 50% during the quarter in all forms, shape and size, and your business is, let\u2019s be conservative and 5 to 6% of your business is lumber. I would have expected the impact to be greater than it was.\nCraig Menear: The inflation overall as it relates to let\u2019s say lumber and copper was about 100 basis points during the quarter, of which about 70 basis points came from lumber. When you look at lumber overall, you\u2019re right. I mean it moved dramatically in the quarter. Framing was up year-over-year almost 62% and panel was up over 45% year-over-year in the quarter. When the market runs at that rate, you have to move with it and we moved pretty quickly with it. And then when you look at the fact that it\u2019s really not demand driven so you\u2019re not seeing positive growth in units, that\u2019s really the element that\u2019s driving the total impact versus what you might expect. If we were getting significant unit growth, then you\u2019d be absolutely correct that you would expect to see more. But it\u2019s still not positive in terms of units.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets:  But just mathematically, shouldn\u2019t let\u2019s call it 5 or 6% of your business at call it up 50%, have much more than 70 basis points impact? I mean shouldn\u2019t it be?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I\u2019m sorry for jumping in, but another way to think about it is just the weighting of sales. You got it right. Lumber\u2019s about 7% of our sales, garden is 20% of our sales and I\u2019m just talking about our garden category, and garden had a double digit positive comp. So it\u2019s really the weighting.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: A couple of follow ups to some of your earlier comments. First of all, on the revenue front, Carol, just to get clarity, you had previously expected sequential improvement through the year. It sounds like you think there\u2019s going to be, there was some pull forward from Q2 into Q1, would you expect I guess two follow ups to that. Would you expect the third quarter to pick up from the second quarter and to what degree are your comments on the second quarter outlook based on what you\u2019ve seen in the month of May to date?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: May to date are, of course we\u2019re a seasonal business, and we\u2019ve had some good days and some bad days but May to date we\u2019re tracking towards plan so that\u2019s good news. We do think to answer the first part of your question, we think the third quarter comps will be higher than the second quarter comps.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs:  My second question, you know you talked about the fact that the ticket recovery has been quite gradual, that the pro recovery has been slow to come. What kind of leading indicators of actual ticket increase and pro sales increase can you typically find in your business, whether its inquiries for some of the bigger ticket purchases, traffic in different segments of the store to the extent that you can measure it? And if you have some read through to those, what are they telling you today?\nCraig Menear: Kind of heavily penetrated pro categories is what we\u2019re watching and when you look at it, still negative in the quarter, I guess the encouraging piece of it was if you look year-over-year in categories like plywood or concrete, substantial improvement in terms of year-over-year. So if you were double digit declines last year at this time, we\u2019re running low to mid single digit declines. So we would continue to watch those types of categories. And then look at the baskets overall to determine are we beginning to see some of the project businesses that would look like room additions and basement remodels. That\u2019s the kind of things we\u2019re watching for.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs:  What about big kitchen and bath projects?\nCraig Menear: Obviously looking at those as well. Those continue to remain under pressure for us overall during the first quarter and we\u2019ll continue to monitor those categories and work to drive market share in them.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Craig, you would agree that if we start to see movement in special order kitchens and baths that would be a good sign for our pro?\nCraig Menear: It would be a very good sign, both on the pro and DIY. Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Todd Duvick - BofA Merrill Lynch.\nTodd Duvick - BofA Merrill Lynch:  I wanted to ask a quick question about not only the cash on the balance sheet but the debt that is maturing. Your leverage metrics are in very good shape, below your 2.5 times leverage target and you\u2019ve got about $1 billion maturing in August and another $1 billion maturing in March. Can you tell us what your plans are for those and if you would use that opportunity to refinance the debt as potentially time to upsize and increase your leverage at this point?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Our intent right now is to refinance the August and the March maturities as they come due. And you\u2019re right, we are under our targeted debt ratio but I must say that that is a cap on how much debt we want to maintain. Running under it is fine with us for right now. We will take it one day at a time and if we decide to do something opportunistically, we\u2019ll let you all know.\nFrank Blake: A point to remember, this is the first quarter of positive comps in the U.S., so it\u2019s the first quarter of positive comps.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: That\u2019s a great point, since 2005.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alan Rifkin - BofA-ML.\nAlan Rifkin - BofA-ML:  A question for Frank, Frank, we\u2019ve heard you speak numerous times about the importance of PFRI and encouragingly in the quarter your business showed solid improvements despite declines. If you continue to see declines in the PFRI for the next quarter or two, to what extent will you proactively kind of put the brakes on spending, anticipating that possibly 2011 may be a little bit more difficult based on that statistic?\nFrank Blake: To be honest, Alan, we wouldn\u2019t do that. I mean I think PFRI has been a useful benchmark for us and has tracked pretty closely to our performance, but if and I\u2019m just assuming your hypothetical is PFRI, we continue to have more quarters like this, where PFRI declines and we improve, we\u2019re going to follow with that actually happening in our business. You know there\u2019s just a lot of goes ins and goes outs with any kind of analysis like PFRI. It is weighted more to the new home construction, so you\u2019d be able to think through lots of rationales of why as the market recovers you could still see a decline in PFRI and our performance continued to do well.\nAlan Rifkin - BofA-ML:  Frank, with the expiration of the first time homebuyer tax credit at the end of April, you know, in hindsight, be it Q1 or even since the implementation of that program last year, what do you think has been the net benefit to your business as a result of that?\nFrank Blake: You know, Alan, it\u2019s a great question and unfortunately I mean we\u2019ve asked that internally and we don\u2019t have a great answer to it. I mean I think we just need to recognize that as the program ended in April, house closings can go until June, our business will frequently lag another 60 to 90 days, you know, the kind of pick up around home improvement spending is in a newly purchased home, so in truth we\u2019re not going to be able to have a really clear picture of the impact on that for us for quite a while.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Chick - FBR Capital Markets & Co.\nStephen Chick - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Frank, in the past you\u2019ve talked about market share versus the government reported numbers of the NAICS 444. In this quarter, I mean for the last five quarters or so, the same-store sales, the two national companies have been exceeding that and it looked like it was for the two combined below it this quarter, maybe even driven by April. Have you guys looked closely at that at all and have a sense?\nFrank Blake: Yes, there are a couple of things on it, Steve. The first is just for the April NAICS data, the government changed the way it does the data set so we\u2019re not fully sure what all the pushes and pulls of that are. The second thing I\u2019d say is that they have the latest two months are two months under revision, and they then go back and true those up. And so we cannot to reference those until after the true up. And if you look historically, there are often some pretty significant swings that happen on those month-to-month true ups.\nStephen Chick - FBR Capital Markets & Co.:  Second, if I could, with the comp store sales of the total company versus the U.S. based stores I think reflects an international contribution of about 150 basis points. Carol, did you say what the foreign currency piece of that was versus what the underlying, the core international business contributed?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I didn\u2019t, but I\u2019m happy to. Of the 1.5% contribution from international, currency actually was 1.6%, and then we lost .1 because of the weighting of the international businesses versus the U.S. businesses. For the first time since 2005, both U.S. and international were positive, but international wasn\u2019t as positive as the U.S., so it actually hurt the comp slightly, if that makes any sense.\nStephen Chick - FBR Capital Markets & Co.:  What is your net interest expense assumption within your guidance today?\nDiane Dayhoff:  I\u2019ll get back to you on that, Steve.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I am so sorry, I don\u2019t have it in front of me.\nOperator: Your next question comes from William Truelove \u2013 UBS.\nWilliam Truelove \u2013 UBS: I have two operational questions, if I may. First, you know through our tours of stores it looks like you have a lot more orange outfits walking around the store, so has there been a change in the customer service metrics year-over-year that you could share with us?\nMarvin Ellison:  You know we talked last year about a couple of service initiatives, and one was power hours where we basically have a period of time of the day where we stop tasking and we spend all the time focused on service. So it was more about visibility, customer engagement and making sure we help customers solve project questions. So that provided visibility. So you don\u2019t necessarily add associates, it\u2019s just associates become more available and more visible. We also talked about an initiative where we\u2019re shifting labor from task to service. Last year we shifted the equivalent of almost four full time associates from jobs that customers didn\u2019t see in the back room to on the sales floor, driving service. So you actually saw a net gain of service associates without a net gain in total associates. We also added in the first quarter approximately one part time associate to the floor with that shift from pass to service. You know Carol talked about how we pulled forward in the season additional staff. Because sales picked up, we had seasonal hiring. So I think you also saw that as an impact as well from the visibility of associates.\nWilliam Truelove \u2013 UBS:  But did you have any kind of service metrics from the customers in terms of the response to that?\nMarvin Ellison: Well, you know, Frank talked about the net promoter score. We increased roughly 600 basis points over last year, so we\u2019re real pleased with that. We have our internal voice of customer survey. We get roughly 100,000 customer surveys per week that we look at. That\u2019s an internal measurement that we stay very close to, looking at front end, likelihood to recommend and some key metrics. Other than that, we\u2019re just driving the same service related focus with our customers and trying to make sure that we have incremental improvement week over week, month over month.\nWilliam Truelove \u2013 UBS:  My follow up question would be about China. You said that you\u2019re continuing to get the business model correct over in China. What kind of timeframe should we be thinking about in terms of maybe getting the China business model sorted out and profitable and growing?\nFrank Blake:\n : So the first answer to that is it\u2019s certainly longer than I expected, so we\u2019re now into our third year and it\u2019s to be honest, it\u2019s still a work in progress. We think it\u2019s an important opportunity and so worth the time, but it is very distinctly different. And I haven\u2019t put and we don\u2019t have a here\u2019s the deadline. Obviously at some point you might go hey, it\u2019s long enough, if you haven\u2019t figured it out by now move on. But it is obviously a very large potential opportunity. It\u2019s very complicated. It\u2019s very different. We\u2019re making progress, so we\u2019re pleased that the first quarter kind of played out as we expected, but at the same time that we\u2019re making progress or maybe it\u2019s a sign of our making progress, we keep identifying new issues and new opportunities to improve. The one thing I want to make sure that we don\u2019t do and we\u2019re all committed to not doing is rolling out, trying to get to scale on a business model that we\u2019re not really comfortable with for our shareholders.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates:  The first question just had to do with some of the metrics you stated on the consumer credit side. How would you interpret sort of the shift to bank credit versus private label credit? Can we read into that that consumers are a little more willing to part with cash as opposed to using credit to do some of these purchases?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to analyze this. I think it\u2019s important to note that 72% of all new account applications on our private label card are being approved and the line is around $5,000, and for the existing cardholders the line is about $6,000, and it\u2019s only 26% utilized. So there\u2019s credit availability with our private label card. I think that\u2019s important to point out. What we are seeing is that many consumers are consolidating the number of cards that they have in their wallet. I know I have. And moving to cards that offer reward. Now as you may know, with the Card Act that was enacted earlier this year, the guiding proposition associated with our private label card changed. It used to be if you spent $299, it was no interest, no payments for six months every day. With the Card Act, it\u2019s still no interest but it is minimum payments. So the value proposition has changed and for a consumer they may say hmm, this is one value proposition I can use my XYZ card and get mileage or points, etc., so we think there\u2019s just been a change there. Now we like our private label card as you know because it is the lowest cost of tender from a credit card perspective in our stores. So we\u2019ve got a number of ideas underway to create new value propositions to get the consumer to use our card. And we\u2019ll be talking to you about those over the next few quarters.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates:  Just one follow up as it relates to product inflation in some of the other categories, more core categories like paint, flooring, faucets. We\u2019re hearing a lot of chatter for price increases in the channel from the manufacturers. Can you talk about what you guys experienced in the first quarter and what your expectations would be moving forward and some of the non-commodity products?\nCraig Menear: There is always things happening inside the cost structure of product categories, and we\u2019re really taking these one off at a time, working individually with our suppliers. You know many times there are announcements of increases. That doesn\u2019t mean that they necessarily all flow through or they certainly don\u2019t flow through at the rates that are announced. So there are movements within certain areas, but in general not a lot of movement in the first quarter. You know a little more talk in the second quarter, but all those are single, one off negotiations.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Cindy, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Gary Balter - Credit Suisse.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse:  Just two questions. One, you talk a lot about the pro and when you think pro, could you break down what you\u2019re thinking in terms of remodel versus tied in with new construction or like how should we be thinking about it from our perspective so we can get a handle on it?\nFrank Blake: Gary, I think our pro is really more the remodel pro. New home build, I mean maybe there\u2019s some activity that we get from that. Again on the smaller pro side or the fill in side, but our core pro customers just as Craig was talking about earlier someone\u2019s doing an addition, it\u2019s the kitchen remodel, it\u2019s really that kind of activity.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse:  Could you talk about where you are in the distribution centers, how much is that costing you at this point and where are you and when do you think we\u2019ll start to see the benefits from a margin perspective?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well as we talked about, Gary, we\u2019re in the rollout phase and so we don\u2019t anticipate any benefit until we complete that rollout phase which will be 2011. The good news is that the distribution centers are running quite well, and so as you might imagine we did have some fuel pressure in the first quarter and we were able to offset that fuel pressure because of how well the DCs are operating. So it\u2019s a good news story.\nMarvin Ellison: We\u2019re also seeing improvements on in stock. We talked earlier about how well we\u2019re performing, even though we\u2019re managing inventory well, we\u2019re seeing out of stock increase. I think we\u2019re estimating roughly 20, 25% at year-over-year. And that is the existing supply chain and the improvements with the RDC working full time. So we expect that to continue as the roll out continues, but even right now we\u2019re seeing those benefits in stores.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse:  Just one follow up on that, Marvin. Just on that, so distribution costs, so this effort is costing you money now and so it\u2019s in the expenses and that will turn into essentially a benefit next year. Is that the way we should be thinking about it?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. That\u2019s the way to think about it.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $16 billion, up 5.9% from last year. Comp sales were positive 5.7%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.50. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 6.1%.  From a geographic perspective, we saw positive comps in all of our top 40 markets. The unseasonably warm weather helped customer traffic and clearly was a factor in our sales performance. We've also seen the steady recovery of some of the hardest hit markets like Florida and California. Our major Florida markets all outperformed the company average, and California was in line with the company average. Both states have posted positive comps for 8 consecutive quarters. As Craig will detail, we saw strength in our core merchandising areas, as well as in our holiday Gift Centers and we had strong growth in customer transactions with sequential comp transaction improvement each quarter this year.  On the international front, our Canadian business had positive comps for the quarter and our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps, making it 33 quarters in a row of positive comp growth. Operationally, Marvin and his team are making progress on our customer service initiatives. Based on the changes we've made throughout the year, we now have approximately 53% of our store labor hours dedicated to customer-facing activity. Just 4 years ago, we were at 40%. So this is a significant improvement in a short period of time. It's required a lot of detailed planning and focused execution at the regional district and store level to make this happen, and this speaks to the alignment of our store operations and support teams. We are also very excited about a new service offering our operations team is in the process of rolling out. This year, our stores will be offering in-store repair services for power equipment and powers tools. Previously, we had an off-site third-party service that would provide equipment repair. We can provide that service ourselves now, leveraging our tool rental centers and reverse logistic centers, customers can have tune-ups and other maintenance completed at our stores. We think this will be a significant improvement and convenience for our customers and will enhance the overall value of our power tool and equipment product offerings.  On the merchandising front, Craig and his steam continued to develop our merchandising tools. The most significant recent activity was the upgrade of our dot-com platform. This upgrade enhances the layout, visual appeal and responsiveness of our site and gives us a best-in-class platform for future interconnected retail development.  Our supply chain investments continue to deliver benefits for the business, improving our in-stock rate and asset efficiency, as we again improved inventory turns this year. As of the end of 2011, we handled approximately 70% of our cost of goods sold through central distribution in the U.S. This compares to approximately 25%, 4 years ago.  For 2012, as Carol will detail, we are expecting sales growth of around 4%, including the 53rd week and diluted earnings per share of about $2.72, again including the 53rd week and without factoring in share repurchases during the year.  There are some interesting challenges in setting expectations for 2012. First, the macro data on housing suggest uncertainty. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP remains near at 60-year low but has a slight uptick in the quarter to 2.26%. The Fed has noted that housing remains a drag on economic recovery with factors such as delayed household formation and credit supply, contributing to a continued imbalance between housing supply and demand. The Fed has suggested the policy actions will be needed to fix this, but it wouldn't appear that any major policy changes are likely in the near-term.  Second, despite this, the performance of our business particularly in the back half of 2011, would suggest the strengthening market. This quarter's comps were achieved against a very strong fourth quarter comp in 2010 and exceeded our internal forecast. But we're mindful that this past December and January were the fourth warmest on record, with much of the nice weather occurring across the heavily populated eastern U.S. Better weather translates into improved sales for exterior categories like building materials and also translates into increased customer transactions, which lift the entire business.  So we think it's too early to say that there's been a significant improvement in our overall market, but we continue to build a strong business on the basic repair and remodel needs of our customers, recognizing that we have a base of over 130 million aging homes. In this environment, we think our growth will be consistent with U.S. GDP, making some adjustments for positive weather impacts in 2011.  In 2012, as in the last several years, we will remain focused on disciplined capital allocation and increasing shareholder return. We will continue to make the necessary investments in our business and return excess cash to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. We raised the dividend twice in 2011, and are targeting a 50% payout ratio going forward.  Finally, I'd like to thank our associates for their hard work and dedication during this past quarter and the year. We're very proud of the fact that 96% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing in the second half of 2011, with our second-highest total payout ever. We look forward to even better results in 2012.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig A. Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We're extremely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and the quarter's results were driven by several factors: solid execution of our game plan for the holiday season, including decorative holiday, Black Friday and our Gift Centers; unusually warm weather that drove increased demand for exterior project categories, which we quickly responded to in order to take advantage of the opportunity; and continued strength in maintenance and repair categories, as well as interior projects. 13 out of 14 departments posted positive comps for the quarter. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were tools, electrical, building materials, paint, lumber, lighting, outdoor garden and flooring. Hardware, bath, kitchens, indoor garden and plumbing showed positive comps. Comp in millwork was negative for the quarter, as we anniversary the expiration of an energy-efficient tax credit in the U.S. Last quarter, I told you the key drivers for our fourth quarter performance would be seasonal categories such as decorative holiday, our Black Friday lineup and our Gift Centers. We delivered positive comp performance for Black Friday and the Black Friday weekend, a strong start to the holiday season. Our Gift Centers also had positive results with double-digit comps overall, led by power tools, Power Tool Accessories and Hand Tools. And as I mentioned last quarter, we increased our decorative holiday buy this year and delivered double-digit comps in that category. And finally, although it was a slight drag to our overall comp, we posted positive comps in appliances for the quarter, against an outstanding performance last year. Warmer-than-expected weather encouraged customers to tackle exterior projects. Our merchants reacted quickly to this opportunity, working alongside our stores and suppliers to leverage our supply chain and drive results. This nimble response facilitated double-digit comps in gutters, roofing, vinyl siding, patio furniture, fencing, exterior paint, pressure washers, exterior lighting and concrete. These positive results more than offset negative performance in winter weather categories such as snow removal, fireplaces and portable heating as the heavy snowfalls of January 2011 were not repeated. Simple interior projects also performed positively in the quarter, driving results in laminate flooring, recessed lighting, bath accessories, ceiling fans, door locks, floor tile and faucets. We are pleased with our performance in interior paint, driven by a number of products. First, our exclusive line of BEHR paints, which had been rated #1 by independent testing. Second, our new Glidden DUO Paint + Primer. And finally, our innovative line of specialty paint from Rust-Oleum and Martha Stewart.  In addition to the strength in seasonal products, exterior projects and interior projects, the maintenance and repair categories that make up the core of our store continued to execute well in the fourth quarter. Comps in categories such as light bulbs, cleaning, pipe and fitting and caulk were strong in the fourth quarter. We were pleased with the continued integration of our online business with our stores through expanded assortments, customer reference tools, marketing outreach and online transparency of realtime inventory in our stores. We saw a total transactions grow by 3.6%, while average ticket also increased 2.4% for the quarter. In the U.S., transaction growth was seen across the store with positive growth in 13 of 14 departments. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 1.3% for the fourth quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 3% in the fourth quarter. Strength in tools and hardware, electrical, building materials, paint and flooring contributed to growth in the average ticket. During the fourth quarter, the total impact to comp from commodity inflation was approximately 20 basis points. As you will recall at this time, last year, I mentioned that we had seen a number of requests from our vendors for price increases as a result of elevating raw material costs. We have seen that number level off over the year, and we have proactively worked with our suppliers to rollback prices as commodity prices have come down. As a reminder, we review each request on an individual basis and our portfolio strategy drives our go-to-market actions. As we look back at our initial expectations for 2011, we thought transactions would lead average ticket growth for the year. However, while transaction growth was positive for the year, average ticket growth was even more positive, driven by a strong recovery and innovation in areas such as LED and lithium technology and strength in kitchens. The strong performance in our kitchen business, which is positively comped for the last 2 years in a row, is a testament to the assortment of value our merchants have delivered in that category.  As we look to 2012, we believe that we are well positioned through continued -- great integrations of our merchandising tools, optimization of our supply chain, great values and innovative products to continue the positive growth trend in transactions and average ticket.  In the first quarter of 2012, we're introducing new products across the store. We are announcing an improved version of our BEHR Premium Plus Ultra Interior Paint and Primer in one. This new formula has better stain-blocking capabilities and improved adhesion on multiple surfaces. This enhancement increases durability and scuff resistance even with a shorter drying time.  In appliances, we are introducing new Maytag ranges equipped with AquaLift cleaning technology, an innovative interior coating that cleans in less than an hour, without high temperatures, harsh chemicals or odor. We will also be introducing a new washer and dryer laundry-pairs from GE and LG. In our seasonal business, we'll be offering a new line of power tools for the garden from Ryobi, starting with a swing trimmer and hedge trimmer featuring a 40-volt lithium-ion rechargeable battery system. This lithium technology offers gas-like performance in a quick charge platform, which can be charged thousands of times over the life of the battery. Rolling out to all stores in February, we are happy to offer our customers an expanded 7 day or less carpet install program. This program, in partnership with Shaw Industries, allows us to offer speed along with a great quality assortment for our customers. Also in flooring, we are upgrading our tile assortment in the first quarter.  Finally, I'm proud of the hard work completed by our merchants to drive value for our customers through the special buys available in our stores now as part of our Savings Spectacular event, as well as a great spring lineup of product offerings.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: First question, just on weather. Was there any way that you -- what about trying to quantify how much of an impact you thought that had in the quarter?\nFrancis S. Blake: So, Colin, it's a little difficult to tell because when you look at -- we had some real strength in interior projects and you wonder whether or not that was driven just because of higher traffic because customers could get to the stores. But our best estimate at this point, is somewhere between 200 and 250 basis points.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just following up, maybe it\u2019s question for Carol or Craig on the gross margin. Can you just update just on how much is remaining in your multiyear gross margin expansion outlook and specifically, on supply-chain? Obviously, a pretty good performance here in the fourth quarter in supply chain with, I think, 50-some basis points of contribution versus incremental supply chain benefit that you expect as you automate DCs. And so just kind of an update on the gross margin outlook and where you are on that journey? And then, how are you thinking about pricing in 2012 and how that might impact gross margin?\nCraig A. Menear: And certainly, we're looking to continue to leverage our productivity, but we also want to invest that back in the customer to drive top line sales, and make sure that we're delivering outstanding values for our customers.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Wanted to follow up a bit on the weather question. If you look at the monthly stacks, December in the U.S. was actually the best month. So I guess, thinking about that 200 to 250 basis points and December being the best stack against the energy tax credit, I mean, do you think you're being perhaps a little conservative in terms of the lift in the weather?\nFrancis S. Blake: You're talking on a 2-year basis, Chris?\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes.\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes. As Craig said, Chris, this is an art, not a science on figuring out how much weather contributed to our sales. But certainly, December was a very warm month. January was a very warm month. And peeling apart how much of that is traffic. So nicer weather, people have an easier time getting to the store versus the more general uplift is just very tough. So our best estimate, as Craig said, is it's between 200 and 250 basis points.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And I guess, maybe the other way to look at that is to say, well, now that perhaps February, it's a little warmer year-to-year but maybe a little more normal or the gap. How's the business performed in the U.S. in February?\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just one quick one as a follow-up. The buyback of $3.5 billion, it looks like it'd be about a $55 embedded price into that. Is that the right calculation?\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.\nWayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just my question relates to cash flow from operations that I think you expect to be about $6.6 billion this year, roughly flat with last year. And, I guess, I look at the big jump in your payable-to-inventory ratio to 47%. In the past, that's been in excess of 50% with where you are, where you're headed with turns. I'm just wondering, are you just being conservative in that cash flow outlook? Or are we getting to a point where $6.5 billion to $7 billion might be kind of a peak operating cash flow number?\nWayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Should we be thinking about 47% as a run rate for the coming year, payable to inventory.\nFrancis S. Blake: Just how we thought about payables, we looked at it actually from a days perspective and we're projecting to increase payable days outstanding by 2 days in 2012.\nWayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. My second question related to this is, why not repurchase more than the $3.5 billion because given the cash flow outlook, which suggest you're going to add another $1 billion to your cash balance for the year, unless you're going to make acquisitions or something, I'm not sure why you would want to take that cash balance up by another $1 billion?\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: Can you talk a little bit about what you observed with mix across the business in the fourth quarter and perhaps the back half of the year? And how you're thinking about where consumers are spending money in terms of price points as we go into 2012?\nCraig A. Menear: Sure, Eric, this is Craig. If we looked at the fourth quarter and in the back half, start with the fact that categories that have been a strength, remained the strength are our maintenance and repair with solid performance as a result. We did have the continued benefit of the repair going on in some of the areas affected by the hurricanes, which drove things like roofing as big repair projects. But we really did see strength across the interior of the store. Simple decor projects were very strong for us in the quarter. That was a -- continued to build on momentum that we had coming off of Q3. And then again, with the benefit of the warm weather, we actually saw project business, exterior project business take place at an accelerated rate, what you would normally expect later in the fourth quarter.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: Great. And then one follow-up. In terms of how you're thinking about promotions and managing your inventory in 2012, understanding you're talking about growth similar to GDP, which feels a little bit conservative in light of the second half of '11. I'm interested in how you're thinking about the promotional cadence, the promotional intensity and how you're managing your inventories in anticipation of that?\nCraig A. Menear: Again, we're still focused on continuing to try to drive value for our customers every day, so that is our remaining focus. We're continuing to work to break promotional cycles in our business. But with the supply chain capabilities that we've put in place, I think, this past quarter was an example of the nimbleness that we now have in our business and we can respond. So we feel good about the capabilities that we've built in the supply chain. In particular, our capabilities to respond to seasonal businesses. So overall, I'd say we're well positioned as we move into 2012.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Dennis McGill With Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Just a question focused on some of the regions, you mentioned California being at the company average and Florida being above and 2 areas that we wouldn't normally attribute to being volatile from the weather standpoint. So just wondering if you could elaborate there, particularly in California, where it seemed like weather was pretty steady year-over-year, especially with some of the housing metrics improving in those markets?\nFrancis S. Blake: Dennis, I think that's exactly the point. I mean, wanted to call out California and Florida because they really aren't weather-related. And so that's an indication that there was more than just weather, which ties back to why we triangulate around the 200 to 250 basis points coming from weather. And I think just exactly as you said, that those markets are more reflective of not a housing recovery, but a stabilization in the markets that we've seen over the last 2 years, as they've just -- they've gotten kind off there, off the floor in effect on housing.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Is there anything in the product for category results in those areas that would differ from what you talked about nationally, that would be indicative of different trends?\nCraig A. Menear: Nothing radically different in those areas.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly, on the point, with Florida being above company average and being a pretty big chunk of the stores, any particular areas that would be offsetting that?\nFrancis S. Blake: In terms of what was below the company average?\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Right.\nFrancis S. Blake: So we had some challenged performances in areas of the southwest, areas of what we call the northern plains, some areas that saw some difficulty.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Laura Champine with Collins Stewart.\nLaura A. Champine - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division: I had a question about market share. As we look back at 2011, were your share gains more driven by product differentiation or price differentiation? And how does that impact your merchandising and pricing decisions in 2012?\nFrancis S. Blake: So, Laura, I'd say just one general comment, which is our market, certainly for us, is very hard to work through what the share gains and share losses are between the government reports and the third-party reports. Frankly, the government reports would suggest that we lost share in the quarter, which we have -- that's a head scratcher for us. And some of the third-party share data also had some interesting anomalies. So I'd say, more of, and I'd ask Craig to address this, I mean, really the pricing decisions are driven more by the portfolio strategy in our customer. What we want to do from a customer rather than from a share gain perspective.\nCraig A. Menear: Yes. I think, the gains that we\u2019ve made in the business, in terms of driving performance, has been really 3 key factors: number one, it's the work that we continue to do on the assortments, to make sure that we're driving relevant product to the customer and the marketplace. The value proposition around those assortments, so that we are using our portfolio strategy to apply pressure on the marketplace. And then third, is our store associates and their ability to drive the business and take care of the customer, get excited about the product that we give them and translate that excitement to our customers.\nLaura A. Champine - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division: So just if I can follow-up, if I'm looking in the stores this year, will they appear more or less promotional than they did in 2011?\nCraig A. Menear: I would say that you won't see a major difference. Again, we're trying to work to break categories. I've shared in the past, there's particular businesses that are tough to break the promotional cycle. But we're working hard to do that. Our objective is to drive every day great value for our customers.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Alan Rifkin with Barclays Capital.\nAlan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Carol, the 4.3x inventory turn is the best number you guys have posted in quite a while, and one would have to believe that part of that improvement is coming from the RDC initiative. I was wondering if you can maybe shed some color on where you think that number can go longer-term in conjunction with the RDC continuing to benefit?\nAlan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And just a follow-up, if I may. I know, Craig, that you said big-ticket $900 and above was up about 3%. But I was wondering if you could maybe shed a little bit more color on exactly what you are seeing with respect to consumers' appetite for starting to undertake big projects? If you can kind of shed a little bit more color on the $900 and above transactions.\nCraig A. Menear: Sure. Yes, there's really kind of 3 factors that are helping to drive that larger ticket transaction. First of all, we're beginning to see the Pro perform more as our consumer has done over the past. So we're beginning to see the growth there, which is obviously, more around project business. The strength that we've had overall in our Kitchen business and Appliance business, obviously, contributes to the growth in the larger ticket as well. And then candidly, the third thing is a continued innovation that we're bringing to the market where customers are stepping in to better product whether it's things like LED, which obviously, allows them to save energy but, obviously, drives ticket for us or things like lithium technology or our paint offering, where we're seeing customers step up to better product.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: First off, I don't mean to belabor the weather question but I know it's very topical here. But how should we think about it? You quantified -- the 200, 250 basis points benefit from the weather. So as we think about this, how much of that you think is -- will be just simply pulled forward and could result in maybe some sales weakness over the next few quarters? Or is it just likely to imply better consumption of those products?\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes, it's a great question and it's one, it's very difficult to get your arms around. I think it's logical to assume that when you're doing exterior projects in the north in January, there may very well be some pull forward in the business from what normally maybe would have transpired in Q2. But it's very difficult to kind of put a number against that.\nFrancis S. Blake: Really hard to get at.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Yes, I understand. The second question I want to ask, more of a big picture type of question. But I think a lot of us are looking at the macro housing data, which has clearly gotten better over the last few months. And we're grappling with -- we've seen some of this before, over the last couple of years. We thought housing was getting better only to disappoint. From your standpoint, just looking from the overall macro environment right now, do you think what we're seeing lately is more sustainable than we've seen in the last couple of years?\nFrancis S. Blake: Brian, I'd say a couple of things. First, we are now not -- we have no government programs to cloud what's happening. So we've kind of now anniversary-ed the last of that with the tax credit for energy efficiency that Craig mentioned. And the way we look at it is, there are some positives that you definitely see on housing. So you do see affordability is at great levels and you got some shadow of household formation that eventually will drive demand, and then you see some negatives. And clearly, credit availability is one of those negatives that really has to get solved for housing to kind of lead the way on recovery.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Melich with ISI.\nGregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Carol, you mentioned in your prepared comments that SG&A would grow at 50% of sales this year, a little bit more. Could you help us understand the variability of that, if sales ended up surprising to the upside. So I assumed that's based on sort of that 2.5%, 3% growth number. If you ended staying like the fourth quarter, would you expect that -- what sort of leverage would we expect on that?\nGregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then second, this follows up to the cash flow from earlier. The $6.6 billion that would also -- I guess, I'm trying to reconcile your net income plus D&A to get to that $6.6 billion. And it seems like there's about a $700 million difference. And it sounds like you'd split the difference in that, might be some working capital improvement?\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I know you touched upon kind of the aging U.S. housing stock out there. And I'm assuming that houses will need more repair maintenance activity as they get older. How do you guys kind of factor that part into your longer-term sales plans?\nFrancis S. Blake: Well, so again, the point on the aging housing base is that that is what's been sustaining our business over the last couple of years is the repair, the basic repair business within homes. What we've seen over the last several years is, you can roughly anticipate that growing with GDP. People -- a lot of repairs are discretionary. We see it in our business and, really, what helps us is a lifting economy. And that's why we have positive growth in 2010, positive growth in 2011, and why we think we'll have positive growth in 2012.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: But, Frank, when you look at, let's call it, what you would think of as kind of...\nFrancis S. Blake: Could it accelerate? Is your question Scot, could it accelerate?\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Yes.\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes. I mean, certainly, we think that as the economy continues to improve, hopefully as unemployment improves, that people will continue to want to do small and large projects in their home. So absolutely, that could improve. But as I said, what we found over the last couple of years is that anchoring ourselves to GDP is about the best predictor we have versus sort of baking in an assumption of what happens with an aging housing base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Two follow-up questions, if I could. You addressed the question of expense growth relative to sales growth. If you think about EBIT dollar growth relative to sales growth or the flow-through. This year, you generated $0.34 on the incremental dollar sales down to EBIT, both in the quarter actually and for the year. Last year was 44%. What's your expectation for EBIT flow-through as you take a longer-term look forward? I know in the past, this might be quite dated, we had thought about 20% per annum. It sounds like the run rate is substantially better than that in the past and also, I think, for 2012. So any thoughts on that?\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then secondly, you talked about the impact of supply chain to gross margin. To what degree do you think your ticket and your sales benefited from in-stock, obviously, your inventory is quite lean, so you're not putting more product on the shelves. But do you think that part of the ticket improvement is in fact, a direct function of supply chain and is it possible to quantify that?\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes. I mean, I would say that there is no question in our mind that part of our improvement in the business has been the work that's been done in the supply chain to make sure that we're delivering the product at the right time in the right quantities to our store. I don't think I can tell you a specific number that's very hard to calculate what that number would be. But we know that by having the capability, to have the right product in the right locations, having it in the quantities that the customer needs, when they expect it. Certainly, we believe has been part of our turnaround over the past couple of years in transaction growth and sales growth in total.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And where's the 99% a year ago, Carol, for the U.S.?\nMarvin R. Ellison: Matt, this is Marvin Ellison. A lot of improvements on IT, Matt Carey and his team deserves a lot of credit. We have inventory visibility in the store that we've never had before. Every item is located, so we know exactly where it's located on the shelf in the secondary department. And not only does that help with the transactions, but it saves a ton of productivity for the associates. So they're spending more time selling, less time looking for products. And all of those things, added together, just creates a better selling process and hopefully, we'll continue to see improvements across the board.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.\nTJ McConville: This is actually TJ McConville filling in for Budd. Question, several of our questions have been answered. But, Craig, you touched on it a bit earlier on the improvements in the professional customer, I know we've been patiently looking for some improvement in that part of the business. Can you elaborate on that a little bit more? I know last quarter, Carol told us that the transactions were down, but the ticket was up. Is that the similar trend? Or is there some sort of shift going on there?\nCraig A. Menear: No, we're actually seeing improvement right now with the Pro in both areas, both transaction and ticket overall. The other thing that we looked at in the fourth quarter is that, at this point, appears that the Pros who spend more with us are larger Pros, seemed to be performing better and that's encouraging. That they are getting more jobs, more work.\nMarvin R. Ellison: And TJ, this is Marvin. We talked a lot about initiatives that we put in place. If you think about this service for a second, we had 130 basis point improvement in Net Promoter Score for the overall store. But for the Pro area, it was 290 basis points. So when you think about the sales performance, a lot of that is attributed, we hope and we're cautiously optimistic too that the segment coming back. But also, we believe the merchants, the IT improvements, the service levels in the stores just making it easier for the Pros to shop and when you combine those 2 things together, again, we remain cautiously optimistic that we'll continue to see it.\nTJ McConville: That's very helpful. And, Marvin, could you share what those Net Promoter Score levels, the absolute levels are for the overall store and the Pro, if you wouldn't mind?\nMarvin R. Ellison: Well, the overall store is 70.7%. For the Pro, I don't have that number with me because the Pro is aggregated into the overall store number.\nTJ McConville: Okay. That's fair enough. The last question I have is housekeeping. How many of the RDCs, Frank, now are mechanized and are we still on plan to rollout as we expected in FY '12?\nMark Holifield: It's Mark Holifield. At this point, 16 of the 19 RDCs are fully mechanized and we're in the process of mechanizing 2 of them in this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: First, competitively, are you seeing anything different promotional-wise and any benefit from Sears potentially closing stores?\nFrancis S. Blake: No. We're really not seeing any major difference in promotional activity in the market right now.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just another sort of bigger picture view and it has been touched on a couple of times but still trying to figure out. How much do you think -- are you seeing any -- your customers buy higher-end products? Do more higher-end kitchen or higher-end bath remodels or is it more sort of entry-level price point relative to a couple of quarters ago? Again, I'm just trying to figure out if your results should be seen as a positive macro sign or is it more sort of company-specific and/or weather-related?\nFrancis S. Blake: We, obviously, we focus on each segment within the line structure because we believe that there's opportunity in each, whether that's the opening price point, the mid-price point or the upper-price point. So there are certainly areas where customers focus in each one of those segments. But what I would tell you is that we're pleased with the growth that we've seen in particular categories as I mentioned, where customers are stepping up in things like LED technology. There's obviously a savings for the customers that relates to the energy usage in their home. But they're certainly willing to put the outlay out for a higher-ticket product to get that payback on their energy savings. Same thing would hold true in products like lithium technology, where the Pro consumer certainly sees the benefit of added power, longer runtimes, more battery charges in their unit. So they're willing to step up in spend at a ticket that's higher than NiCad. Or customers who are stepping in to organic or natural products, which generally carry a higher ticket. But they see the benefit that, that brings to them. So we're seeing both, I guess, is the way to answer the question. Where the innovation, the value proposition for the customer is there, on a upper-end higher ticket product. The customer is not afraid to spend money there.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And could I just ask one more follow-up, just same type of idea but maybe more simply within like a kitchen remodel or something like that. Where you have an entry level cabinet that you could buy or sort of mid-level or a higher level. Anything in those specific categories, whether it be bathroom or kitchen rather than an LED, which is sort of a, I think, step-up in a light bulb. Just the overall scope of the project, do people sort of opt in for the high-end stuff?\nFrancis S. Blake: I would say in the kitchen business, it's actually been a blend. And it hasn't -- it's not that it skewed one way or another. It's actually been a blend of product.\nFrancis S. Blake: Right.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: But is that blend different than it may had been a couple of quarters ago, where it would had been like all entry levels?\nFrancis S. Blake: No. It's been pretty much the same for the past almost 2 years.\nOperator: Our final question will come from David Gober with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Frank, you noted in your prepared remarks that you're now at about 53% of store labor hours allocated to selling. Is there any way to quantify the benefit to the comp that that's been providing, or any way to maybe identify specific department that have benefited from that shift in labor hours?\nFrancis S. Blake: Well, again, I'll ask Marvin to comment on this as well. I think that a difficult -- it's a little bit like the in-stock rate. You know that being better in-stock translates into better sales. You know that having more customer-facing hours should translate into better sales. If you think about kind of the spectrum of retailers, we are much more customer-assist that many other retailers. Our associates drive a lot of discretionary purchase. So we think it's a plus, but it's very difficult to put a number to it.\nMarvin R. Ellison: So this is Marvin. We work with the merchants to try to understand their strategic focus for the year, so we can understand where we invest the labor. As Craig's team tends to focus on, the core categories like hardware, we will skew our labor allocation more heavily toward those core departments. We've seen strength across the business as reflected in the numbers. But I think Frank said it very well, hard to quantify specifically. What we do know intuitively is that we're a project business. We sell projects, not items and that require a level of service that you won't see in a typical retailer. So because of that, because of the training and because of the investments of what we estimate to be, on average, about 4 associates added on the sales floor and payroll for service, we think that it is definitely benefiting the business. But again, quantifying it specifically is always a little difficult.\nDavid Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And a follow-up if I could. Carol, you mentioned that your guidance assumes that the quarterly variability is fairly -- in a fairly tight band. Which surprised me a little bit given the variability in 2011 and some of the seasonal factors, it also implies that on a 2-year stack basis, that the business should continue to accelerate throughout the year. Is that a fair assumption? Is that what you guys are looking for? And is there anything else that we should be aware of within that seasonal outlook?\nDiane S. Dayhoff: Well, thank you to everyone who joined us on the call today. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference.

Inc., Research Division\nOperator: Good day, everyone, and welcome today's Home Depot Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today's discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDiane S. Dayhoff: Thank you, Vicky, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analysts' questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors, and as a reminder, we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up please. This conference call is being broadcast realtime on the Internet at earnings.homedepot.com. The replay will also be available on our site. If we are unable to get your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387.  Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided on our website.  Now, let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrancis S. Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $17.3 billion, up 4.4% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.2% and our diluted earnings per share were $0.60. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 3.8%.  From a geographic perspective, we saw positive comps in all but 5 of our top 40 markets, with particular strength in areas such as our New Jersey and South Atlantic regions, where there were significant storm impacts. As Craig will detail, we saw growth not only in storm-related product categories but also in our core categories. An interesting broad indicator of this is that our strongest division for the quarter was our western division, which was obviously not affected by Hurricane Irene. We're also pleased that the growth in our overall transaction count has improved sequentially each quarter this year.  On the international front, our Canadian business had essentially flat comps in the quarter and our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps, making it 32 quarters in a row of positive comp growth. Sustained positive performance quarter-over-quarter for 8 years in a row, a testament to the great job that Ricardo Saldivar and the team in Mexico are doing.  In the U.S., we still don't see and we don't expect to see in the near term any meaningful tailwind from the housing market. Inventories remain high, pricing is under pressure and credit is still difficult. Private fixed residential investment, PFRI, as a percent of GDP, is still at a historic low. In this type of environment, it's critical that we effectively invest in our business and keep focused on customer service. To that end, Marvin and his team rolled out 3 major initiatives during the third quarter: Buy Online Pickup In-Store; a new scheduling system for our associates; and a new centralized return to vendor process. These have involved significant operational changes in our stores over a compressed period of time. It's an indication of the effectiveness of our field leadership team that we could execute these initiatives without significant store disruption. Both the new scheduling system and the new return to vendor process are allowing us to increase customer facing hours in our stores at the same time that we're improving overall labor productivity.  Our supply chain investments are also delivering significant benefits for the business. As Carol will discuss, we leveraged supply chain expenses in the quarter. As you know, last year, we completed the build-out of our Rapid Deployment Centers, RDCs. Not all of those facilities were mechanized from the start. This was a conscious decision to gain speed in the rollout and to learn about the processes within the RDCs before committing to mechanization. As we've added mechanization, we're seeing benefits in capacity, efficiency and accuracy. We're now underway with mechanizing 3 more facilities and by the end of fiscal 2012, 18 of the 19 facilities will be mechanized. Year-to-date in the U.S., we've handled approximately 65% of our cost of goods through centralized distribution, compared to approximately 25% for all of 2007. We have a goal of 75% by 2015.  On the merchandising front, Craig and his team along with Matt and the IT team, continued to make significant progress on developing tools for our merchandising transformation. If you've followed Home Depot for a while, you know that one of our major areas of opportunity is in upgrading our legacy special order systems. We're now in the midst of a multiyear initiative to replace the legacy system, not with one major change-out but with a series of incremental releases. We're about 1/3 of the way through this effort and are very pleased with the success to date. We've digitized our catalogs and are putting the building blocks of the new order management system in place. We're also in the midst of a major upgrade of our dot com platform, which we anticipate completing by the end of this fiscal year.  But this is not only about technology. There are underlying improvements in our merchandising processes that owe more to business alignment than technology. We now have a process for developing and executing our off-shelf and cross merchandising strategy across the company. This may seem straightforward, but it's involved some trial and error blending of centralized merchandising direction with local entrepreneurial activity. As we've gained alignment, we're now seeing steady improvement in sales and unit growth from our off-shelf activity as we add more merchandising excitement and value to our stores.  We will continue to invest in our business to improve customer service and productivity. Along with that, we believe it's also critical to continue to invest in our associates. Approximately 81% of our stores would qualify for Success Sharing based on our third quarter results, and our objective is to maintain record levels of Success Sharing payouts to our hourly associates.  Finally, today, our board announced a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share. Carol will discuss our updated capital allocation principles in a few minutes. Our guiding philosophy has been and will continue to be to maintain discipline on our capital allocation, focus on creating value for our shareholders and maintain a solid financial footing for our business on a sustaining basis.  Let me close by thanking our associates for all their hard work and dedication in the third quarter. And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig A. Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Sales in the third quarter were driven by continued strength in the core of the store, as well as storm recovery. We saw growth in both average ticket and transactions during the quarter. 10 of our departments posted positive comps for the quarter. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were tools, electrical, indoor garden, building materials, plumbing and hardware. Paint, flooring, lighting and kitchen showed positive comps. Comps in lumber, outdoor garden, bath and millwork were negative for the quarter.  Cleanup activity from the impacts of Hurricane Irene and the resulting flooding led to strength in storm-related products, such as generators, pumps, extension cords and wet/dry vacs. We also saw a continued strength in roofing and gutters as customers repaired damage from early harsh winter weather. We estimate that the impact of storm-related sales to be approximately a point of comp.  The temperatures normalized after a hot August, and we saw our customers return to simple outdoor projects in outdoor living categories. We're particularly pleased to have posted positive comps in categories such as patio furniture, fireplace, walk-behind mowers, grills and lawn accessories given the strong performance we saw in outdoor living categories during the third quarter of 2010. Outdoor projects, such as fencing, exterior stains, exterior paint and irrigation also performed well in the quarter.  We did see some regional variances. For example, with drought-like conditions in parts of the southern division, we saw tough sales of riding mowers and live goods, partially offset by strong sales of water.  The maintenance and repair categories that make up the core of our store continued to perform well. Project basics, such as pipe and fitting, fasteners, air circulation, hand tools, chemicals, clocks and appliance parts, were positive. And as customers prepared for winter, small maintenance projects like installation and waterproofing also sold well.  Great brands and innovative products led to positive performance in portable power, Power Tool Accessories and Hand Tools during the third quarter. We offered outstanding values in power tools from brands like Ryobi, Milwaukee, Makita, RIDGID and DEWALT and we're seeing consistent response to these brands from our customers. We have also seen positive results from our Pro customers in Hand Tools from the Milwaukee and DEWALT lines that are exclusive to The Home Depot.  We continue to deliver innovation through the extension of our LED light bulb offering for the home. At the beginning of the third quarter, we added the first 2 LED bulbs that will fit most customers' recessed cans. Additionally, we just added the first commercially available 75-watt equivalent LED A-line replacement.  We saw our total transactions grow by 1.2%, while average ticket also increased 3% for the quarter. The transactions per tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were flat for the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our ability to manage effectively against categories that were significant transaction drivers in the third quarter of 2010. Transactions for tickets over $900, which also represent approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.6% in the third quarter. Strength in roofing and generators contributed to the growth in our average ticket.  During the third quarter, lumber prices were essentially flat to last year. Concrete pricing was elevated but began to come down at the end of the quarter. The total impacts to comp from commodity inflation during the quarter was approximately 40 basis points.  As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we're facing the anniversary of the expiration of an energy-efficient tax credit in the U.S. that increased sales in millwork and home services during the fourth quarter of 2010. We are also lapping strong performance from our Gift Centers, as well as our Black Friday line up last year. We planned for this, and we're projecting to deliver positive comps in the quarter. We're excited about our decorative holiday and Gift Center offerings, as well as our Black Friday lineup.  We have expanded our LED Christmas light selection to over 70 different options, and earlier this month, we gave customers rebates for trading in old incandescent strands. We also have added several new holiday decoration offerings from Martha Stewart. Our Gift Center offers outstanding values, with strong lineups of hand tools, power tools, safety items, tool storage and special buys. And finally, we have a strong line up of special buys for Black Friday, including appliance offers.  We're excited about the products and values that we have to offer our customers in the fourth quarter and we invite you to visit us in store, online or through our mobile apps to check them out.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $17.3 billion, up 4.4% from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 4.2% for the quarter, with comps up 5.2% in August, 4.1% in September and 3.5% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 3.8% for their quarter, with U.S. comps up 4.5% in August, 3.4% in September and 3.4% in October.  In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.4%, an increase of 15 basis points from last year, of which 13 basis points came from our U.S. business. The gross margin expansion in the U.S. was driven by 26 basis points of benefit arising from our supply chain transformation, offset in part by a change in the mix of products and services sold, as well as higher shrink compared to last year. For the year, we expect moderate gross margin expansion.  Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 45 basis points to 25.1%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive sales growth, as well as continuing cost control. While we had $26 million of natural disaster expense arising from storm damage, we leveraged every major expense line in the quarter. For the year, we now expect total expenses to grow at approximately 20% of our sales growth rate. Interest and other expense for the third quarter totaled $158 million, slightly higher than last year due to higher debt levels. Our income tax provision rate was 35.9% in the third quarter, and earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.60, up 17.6% from last year.  Now moving to our operational metrics, during the third quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico and one new store in St. Croix. We temporarily closed one store in Bennington, New York due to flooding damage, and we expect this store to reopen during the fourth quarter. At the end of the third quarter, we were operating 2,246 stores and selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the third quarter were $293, up 4.3% year-over-year.  Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, inventory was $10.7 billion, down approximately $300 million from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.3x, a modest improvement from last year. We ended the quarter with $41.5 billion in assets, including $2.2 billion in cash.  In the third quarter, we repurchased $800 million or 23.6 million shares of outstanding stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $3.1 billion or 87 million shares. It is our intent to continue using excess cash to repurchase shares, and we plan to repurchase approximately $400 million of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter.  Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 14.1%, 210 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2010.  On the capital allocation front, we continue to have a disciplined and balanced approach, investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In this regard, we have a few items to call out. First, year-to-date, we spent roughly $820 million in capital expenditures and anticipate that our total capital spending for fiscal 2011 will approximate $1,250,000,000. Second, as Frank mentioned, we just announced a 16% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.29 per share. With this, we are lifting our targeted dividend payout ratio to 50%, up from our previous target of 40%. Third, as of the end of the third quarter, we have $6.8 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. It is our intent to use excess cash to repurchase shares and complete the authorization by the end of fiscal 2014. And finally, we're assuming a slightly more conservative financial risk profile and are targeting to maintain an adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio of approximately 2x. Our updated shareholder principal guidelines reflect our view that a solid dividend coupled with prudent use of cash will create the most value for all stakeholders.  Now let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. Our sales performance continues to outpace real GDP growth, driven by strength in the core of our store, as well as certain weather-related sales and merchandising events. Year-to-date, our sales have grown by 2.9%. We face a tough sales comparison in the fourth quarter, but consistent with earlier guidance, we continue to project that our fiscal 2011 sales will grow by approximately 2.5%. Our business continues to perform to our expectations, and we're seeing positive comps thus far in November. Based on our year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now project fiscal 2011 earnings per share to increase approximately 18% to $2.38. While we intend to repurchase $400 million of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter, given the timing of the repurchases, they won't have a meaningful impact to our full year EPS guidance. Now we'll share our 2012 guidance with you during our fourth quarter earnings call, which is scheduled for February 21.  We thank you for your participation in today's call and Vicky, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question, just delving into the 2.0 debt to EBITDAR target, up previously -- or down previously from 2.5%. So I just was curious if you could spend a little more time talking about that decision. I think that dividend, after raising the dividend, you kind of get back to a similar capital distribution level in either situation, but I was just curious what the conversation was among senior management and the board.\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes. Chris, let me make a general comment and then turn it over to Carol. I first agree with your comment in terms of the return of money to our shareholders. We also looked at the fact that while we've had the 2.5x guardrail that we've described, actually, for the last several years, we've been running at about 2x. So we thought that it was better just in terms of transparency to say here's what we think is the right target for us going forward. And obviously, as our earnings improve, that will have capacity for additional debt. Carol?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Right. And you've seen that this year, we raised to $1 billion of incremental debt earlier in the year while maintaining that 2x ratio. So looking ahead, as our earnings grow, it gives us more borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. But we also think in this low growth economic environment, a solid financial condition is a competitive advantage and we're really pleased with where we are. Now you might say, \"Oh gosh, interest rates are low. Don't you have an opportunity to borrow?\" Our perspective is interest rates will remain low for a while, so no hurry to rush out to the market.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then on a follow-up on the expense side, if you back out the $23 million or $26 million, it looks like you would have leveraged SG&A about 60 basis points. So I was just curious if there was any incentive comp drag in there. And also, should we think about 20 basis points of SG&A leverage per point of comp? It was a bit lower, so I was just trying to figure it out there.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, sure. In the third quarter, our expenses grew about 59% of our sales growth rate and there are a couple of factors you need to keep in mind. First, we did have $26 million of natural disaster expense arising from flooding. And then last year, you may recall, we had a $20 million gain on the sale of real estate that didn't repeat this year. So there's a little bit of year-over-year distortion. For the full year, we're expecting our expenses to grow at about 20% of our sales growth rate. And that's a real tribute to just the great work that the team is doing in driving productivity in all expense lines.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I wanted to actually follow up on the capital allocation first. Carol, you said that you thought that 2.0 was \"the right leverage ratio.\" Yes, I think the academic work would suggest that that's probably not the optimal cost of capital for a company like you. So how are you arriving at 2.0 as the right? And then just to follow up on that, is there any sense here that you want to keep a more conservative ratio for either economic reasons because you're uncertain about the future or a more conservative ratio so that you have maybe some dry powder expansion outside the U.S.? I know you've -- or outside of North America? I know you've talked about or potentially acquisitions down the road, so that you have capacity if you wanted to do something like that.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: It's such a great question in terms of the right ratio because all day long, from an academic perspective, we should say that really, we should put a lot more leverage into our capital structure, perhaps go down to a BBB rating or less to optimize the weighted average cost of capital. And yet when you look at it, you really believe it can create shareholder value that way. We think that by maintaining an adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio of 2x, we're projecting growth in 2012 and beyond. That's going to add additional borrowing capacity into our capital structure, afford us a tremendous amount of financial flexibility.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And what is that financial flexibility for? I guess that was my second question.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, as you know, we're investing our capital in our existing business. As we think about financial flexibility, what our actions have shown is that we use it for the shareholders. So when we borrowed the $1 billion this year, we returned that to the shareholders through an accelerated share repurchase.\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes. And I would also say, Colin, this is not a signal that there's something different in our minds internationally or anything like that. In fact, I mean, this is really just a slight move from what we've previously said and no move at all from what we've been doing over the last 3 years.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. I'm still not sure I'm certain with the thinking there, but a second quick follow-up, just in terms of your comments around the tough sales compare, are you seeing any impact yet from anniversary-ing the tax credits in some of those categories?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, if I could just jump in and then Craig will comment, November is our toughest comparison, as you know, and we're positive comping thus far this month. If you look at the performance by category, millwork is one of our softest categories.\nCraig A. Menear: Right, we're definitely seeing the pressure from the growth in millwork last year versus this year. It was one of the areas that we negative comped in, in the third quarter. We anticipate that it will be a very tough comp in the fourth quarter based on the overlap of the tax credit.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: First, just a question on the comp progression for the quarter. So you indicated that whether -- and I'm assuming you're talking mostly about the hurricane, I just want to -- so as you look at the comp progression for the quarter, was the majority of that weather benefit then in the month of August early in the quarter?\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes, it was.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. So basically, the comps have kind of progressed evenly through the quarter. The second question, I just wanted to ask a question on the capital allocation discussion to EBIT, the timing. You made the announcement today on the dividend and the targeted debt ratios. As you decide to do this, is this more a reflection of what you're seeing inside your business, inside The Home Depot enterprise? Or is it more a reflection of external factors you decided just now?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, generally, we've been on a cadence of lifting the dividend every year in the January, February timeframe. As we sat back and looked at the performance of the business, the confidence that we have in all the initiatives that we've got underway and our prospects for the future, we said there's no better time than to lift the dividend. Now, you shouldn't expect us to lift the dividend again in January or February of 2012. You should expect us to come back at the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013 to look to lift the dividend again. We felt there was no better time. We also just wanted to add a little bit more definition around the targeted adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio. I can't tell you the number of times we get asked, \"When are you going to lever up to 2.5x?\" We set 2.5x as a cap, not a target. We are now setting 2.0 as the target, and we will maintain the target.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Carol, you set me up. When are you going to lever up to 2.5x lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR, I guess? But -- the strategy makes sense. You weren't getting credit for keeping it at or below 2x, so now you're merely signaling that that's what you're going to do. But under -- are there certain triggers for -- so if you started to see 4% comp growth for an extended period of time like you have?\nFrancis S. Blake: So that's -- look, Michael, that's a great question, great comment. These things are situational. So as the situation changes, we could obviously change what our target is. But as Carol said, we thought for the purposes of transparency, it was better to say, \"Hey, this is what we've been doing for this -- for the last 3 years.\" We don't see this changing going forward. When we do see it, if circumstances change, growth starts to accelerate a lot more, then you might have a different answer.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Understood. And then on the promotional side, is there a philosophy to promote to the comp? And by that, I mean you anticipated that you have a difficult fourth quarter comparison. So does that mean that you're intentionally planning some activities to comp the comp? And is that different than how you've been in the past?\nCraig A. Menear: Michael, we're always trying to build the business to drive comp performance year-over-year. And I think the key focus that we've been trying to have for the past several years is to drive everyday great value for our customers, to build our business bay by bay so that we're driving consistent performance. Certainly, we go in and we create events. We're conscious of the fact that we need to, in total, cover that volume, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to cover in that category.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Let me sneak one last one in there. The 3 initiatives that were completed during or near completion during the third quarter, have there been incremental costs associated with those activities such that we should see some benefits to the cost structure moving forward?\nMarvin R. Ellison: This is Marvin. From a cost standpoint, the answer is no real incremental cost. These are big initiatives and the goal is to hit our 60-40 ratio of service and task. So the goal primarily is to drive productivity. We believe that we're going to see productivity improvements in the short term, but more productivity improvements will be in 2012 and going forward.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And if I could just jump in, some of the costs that we did experience was capitalized cost associated with new technology. So if you look at our capital spending, it's up year-on-year and most of that delta is in the area of technology.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets.\nDavid S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Two questions. First, going to the capital allocation, when you look on your capital allocation, who are you benchmarking against sort of to make some of these decisions?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: We look at the world, is the broad answer. It's hard to look at a retailer to say, \"Ah-ha, this is a company that we want to emulate.\" So we look broadly at the Dow Group of Companies, the S&P group of companies. There's some really good stories out there to follow. One good story would be McDonald's. We love what McDonald's has done, but there are other companies as well.\nDavid S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I guess in the past, you had -- I think Frank, you had mentioned at one point JCPenney, but they seem to have changed strategies pretty dramatically, I think, over the years as well.\nFrancis S. Blake: I guess -- the other question was?\nDavid S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: They may be in the process of doing that.\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes, exactly.\nDavid S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: One other -- if you mentioned, did I miss talking about appliances? It seems to have been a very volatile category in the third quarter in that there seems to have been winners and losers throughout the industry. I was just trying to get a sense where are you guys -- how you guys did in that area.\nCraig A. Menear: We were mid-single-digit negative in appliances.\nDavid S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Do you think you gained lost share?\nCraig A. Menear: We believe we lost just a little bit of share in the quarter.\nDavid S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: And when you're doing -- losing share there, do you think it's because of just an unwillingness to match on price? Do you think there's anything structural there? Do you think it was just sort of around near-term pricing?\nCraig A. Menear: I don't think there's anything structural there. I think it's just there's activity in the marketplace. We have a portfolio strategy. We're comfortable with the position that we take in appliances, not looking to be the leader in that business.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: I think that's the key, isn't it? I mean, we're #3 and we're happy being #3.\nCraig A. Menear: Right.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I'll ask one question and a follow-up. The question just on the cadence of the buyback, so I think you're saying about $3.5 billion this year. And then the $6.8 billion to 2014 equates to something in the $2.3 billion range. So a significant slowdown. I guess the question is, is there upside to that number? Or is it really just a signal that you're just going to buying back less annually? And then I'll ask my follow-up upfront. It would relate against the Appliance business. So I think, hhgregg and Sears were pretty aggressive in the quarter. What are you seeing in November, particularly from your biggest competitor in terms of pricing in general but specifically on appliances as they seem to be signaling a more aggressive posture?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: So I'll start with the cadence on the buybacks. We gave some color today, hoping it would help you build your models. The way I would think about it is we're spending $2.5 billion with cash generated from the business to buy back shares this year. So you should assume at least $2.5 billion next year. That would mean $2.5 billion in '13, with remaining $1.4 billion in '14. However, as we just talked about, with increased earnings, we will have borrowing capacity. Just like we did this year, we raised $1 billion that takes us to the full $3.5 billion. So as we look at next year, we'll have borrowing capacity which would allow us to accelerate some of the share repurchases. I don't want to tell you the day, the time as we sit here in November because we want to be opportunistic in terms of debt capital raising. But there is clearly an opportunity to accelerate it, but hopefully, this is helpful from a modeling perspective.\nCraig A. Menear: On the appliance front, we've seen the market be fairly aggressive in this category. We see that it's off to a strong start in terms of the promotional activity, if you will, in the business as we head into the holiday season here. We're candidly pretty comfortable with the plans that we've put together for the business in the fourth quarter. So again, it fits within -- our plans fit within our portfolio strategy overall.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill: Carol, I guess just first question would be around inventory. Can you maybe talk about the decline in the quarter and how you guys are viewing inventory overall and maybe highlight some categories where you're being either more conservative or more opportunistic?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, we're thrilled with our inventory performance, and we've just spent a lot of money transforming our supply chain, so we're hoping to see this come through. As you know, we've committed to get a full turn of improvement over the next several years. If you look at where we are seeing it, part of it is really just in terms of the quality of the inventory. Our clearance levels are as low as they had ever been in our company history. And then Craig, you might want to give some color on just how we're going about forecasting and. . .\nCraig A. Menear: Sure. I mean, all of the tools that we've been building and putting in place -- the forecasting system that was put into place has helped us better manage the inventory on a day in, day out basis. We've absolutely worked hard over the past several years to do a much better job of managing our seasonal inventory. But now, we're seeing benefits come through in our basic categories as a result of these tools that we've put into play. Obviously, the RDC allows us to effectively put inventory where it's needed, with the last minute allocation that's put into place. So it's all of these elements that are coming together that's helping us leverage the inventory investment.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And then if I could just jump in, I would say in-store execution is also helping. So Marvin, you might want to give a couple of comments about power packdown and what we do there.\nMarvin R. Ellison: Dennis, as a little bit of perspective, when product comes from the RDC, over 80% goes directly from receiving to the sales floor. I've been here over 9 years, and that's a big difference from what we've seen in the past. If you walk our stores today, as Carol mentioned, you'll see less product in the overhead than in the history of the company. It's not because we are doing anything other than getting the right product at the right place at the right time and we have some very fundamental things that we're doing in the store just to keep the product on the shelf, stay in stock, so we can limit the amount of inventory and have product on the shelf for customers to buy. It's a very fundamental approach, but the RDC and the technology Craig mentioned allows us to do this much better than we ever have before.\nCraig A. Menear: That's the most important thing, is the fact that when we look at inventory productivity, that is always measured against in-stock. And so we're constantly making sure that as we look at the investments we're making in the inventory that, that is balanced by the fact that we have to continue to improve our in-stock position for our customers, which we have.\nDennis McGill: Okay. And so a follow-up on that would be, I guess, Carol, do you have a target of where you'd like to end this year on inventory? And then bigger picture, as you continue to refine the distribution network, working capital with a nice swing this year versus the last. Any general thoughts on how we could think about that in '12? Can you continue to strip working capital out of the business in total?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Yes. So we should show some -- modest improvement in inventory turns year-on-year by the end of the year. That certainly is our target and we're on path to deliver that. As we look to 2012, we'll give you more color in February, but I can tell you we're building our plans right now and we're building working capital as a source of cash for 2012.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: When you look at the different size buckets that you guys lay out for us, I think it's interesting that you've had actually a pretty nice gain in 3 of the last 4 quarters, not necessarily intuitive given kind of what we're seeing in the broader housing market. I get the fact that stuff like storms can certainly help and skew the data little bit, but are guys seeing -- or do you sense there's a little bit of change in consumer appetite for bigger projects? Or has 3 the last 4 quarters just had its own unique aspects?\nCraig A. Menear: I think what's happening is as you mentioned, certainly as I call out, roofing, generators, those type of things that are storm related, certainly helped. But the fact that we had a positive comp growth in our kitchen business again is an indication of the work that we've done to really develop the business, give value to the customer across any way they want to buy a kitchen, whether that's in stock, take it home today, special order, have their cabinets refaced. All those being positive, being a bigger-ticket sale, has contributed to the past few quarters in terms of the big ticket growth. And candidly there, that's an area where we're taking share because the industry itself isn't growing from everything we can gather from our supply base.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: The other thing, we've just started up a new consumer insights team and we're getting some very interesting data. If you look at the third quarter, both our transactions and our ticket grew, as you know. But when you break it down between consumers and Pro, we saw an increase in transactions and ticket for the consumer. But in the Pro, transactions were down but the ticket was way up. So the Pro who's shopping with us is more sticky and is buying more with us.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Interesting. And then just any thoughts or color regarding year-over-year comparison for that big ticket bucket? Obviously, you were up. I think it was north of a 9% increase last year in the fourth quarter?\nCraig A. Menear: Yes.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: The fourth quarter was a strong quarter.\nCraig A. Menear: It was a very strong quarter last year.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: I think we've got to anniversary that.\nCraig A. Menear: And again, as I mentioned, we were aware that we have to deliver upon those comps. We've built programs across the store to be able to do that. There's businesses, for example, where the continued development of LED helps drive increase in ticket inside of that category. Lithium tools, for example, carries a higher ticket than NiCad power tools. So there's elements across the store that we're driving to continue to build the ticket in our business.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company.\nDaniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to jump back to the competitive landscape for a minute, your main competitors' shifting more towards EDLP. I'm just curious if you're feeling compelled or seeing any need to price match in certain areas of the store. And there also seems to be a little bit more of an emerging online growth by some other players. I'm just curious how you're viewing the online opportunity longer term. I know you're investing a lot in that currently.\nCraig A. Menear: So first and foremost, from a go-to-market strategy, ground zero for us is our portfolio strategy. We always go back to our portfolio strategy. What is it we want to stand for? How we drive the business? That determines both assortment strategy, as well as our go-to-market pricing strategy in the business. We've been focused for a number of years on driving to everyday great value for our customer. That remains our focus. Certainly, we have categories like appliances, where the industry still remains promotional. It's difficult to break those businesses as hard as we're trying. But our focus is really on trying to drive great value for our customers everyday. When we look at competition, we look at competition across a broad segment. It's not just our largest competitor in this space. We compete against multiple people, independents, as well as online competitors. And we're constantly looking at how we react to the market. Again, our portfolio strategy guides, where we react and how we react to what -- adapt and react in a given category. But that's a constant monitoring, both of brick-and-mortar retail as well as online retail, and making adjustments in our business to make sure that we're delivering value for our customers.\nDaniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So I guess with that said, are you finding that you're having to do any kind of material, price matching activity? Is that getting -- is that seeing any kind of increases? Or are you doing it in the aisles before the customer approaches you?\nCraig A. Menear: Yes. I haven't seen in our numbers any dramatic change in competitive price match data. We are constantly monitoring the market on a weekly basis, proactively making adjustments in our business as we need to.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And we view broad discounting with a great deal of caution, and we have competitors who do offer broad discounts like with their private label card or something like that. And we aren't seeing that we have to match that.\nMarvin R. Ellison: Dan, this is Marvin. There's really great alignment between the store operators and Craig's field merchandising team. We're keenly aware of all of our competitors, but we have not seen any major changes in price match, not in the near term or even in the past. We're just very consistent with how we run our business. And as Craig mentioned, the portfolio strategy is the cornerstone and we provide input into that.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Todd Duvick with Bank of America.\nGregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is Greg Hessler standing in for Todd Duvick. Do you have a targeted credit rating? I mean, with the announcement this morning, as well as how your leverage has been creeping lower over the past several years, I wanted to see if you have a target there. And was that a factor at all for the rationale?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Today, we have a split rating. We got a BBB+ rating from S&P and a weak single A from Moody\u2019s. We think having an unsplit rating would be good, so a weak single A would be a good target for us.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: You've shown I think what you characterized as a little bit better sales growth than the market. You've done better on expenses and better on gross margin. I guess, I'm curious as you think about 2012, the sustainability of what looks to have been some outperformance relative to the market maybe even relative to your targets across those 3 areas.\nFrancis S. Blake: Well, Eric, that's -- our job is to continue to invest in the business so that we position ourselves to continue to gain market share. That's -- we don't stop. It wasn't like 2010 or 2011 we look at as one-off years. It's a sustaining effort, and that's really the purpose behind our investments on supply chain, merchandising tools and in the operational side.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: We're on a path to reach a 10% operating margin by 2013.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: As you think about 4Q, characterized as this tougher comparison and see maybe [ph] that the market share gains or the upside sales performance may take a pause in the fourth quarter, I guess I'd be interested if you could broaden your thoughts on that if that's a one quarter event or if now the comparisons are tougher so we're going to see more in line with the market type of sales performance.\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes. I think if you go back to the fourth quarter of 2010, I mean, it was a significant outperformance in 2010. And as we called out at the time, around our seasonal and appliance offerings. We know, as Craig said, that's in our plans for how we approach the fourth quarter but that delta performance was probably a one-off in that quarter.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: This is also the impact of the energy tax credit. In the fourth quarter of last year, we estimated it drove about 40 to 50 basis points of comp in the fourth quarter. As we've reflected on it and done additional work, it was an even bigger contribution. So that's not repeating this year.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: And then one other follow-up, on the gross margin line impact of inflation, did you see any negative impact or notable impact on profitability from inflation in the quarter?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: We didn't. We would've called it out had we seen that.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.\nTJ McConville: This is actually TJ McConville filling in for Budd. Carol, you mentioned quickly in passing the consumer insights team and what you're finding with your pro customer in reference to ticket and traffic. I would love to hear any of the other findings that you've had so far with that program as to maybe within the Pro, what the category changes have been, maybe if you're gaining share there, or anything that you've found early days so far.\nFrancis S. Blake: So TJ, as Carol referenced and kind of if you take a step back, we had, had an outside third party firm that was helping us do consumer insights. We've now shifted and have that capacity in-house. And some of the very basic data is what we're just getting now, but it is just starting now. So around the very broad, \"Hey, here's what your Pros are doing. Here's what your consumers are doing.\" So we really don't have additional items to share with you all.\nTJ McConville: Okay, fair enough. We'll look forward to hearing those data. And then secondly on -- Marvin, you mentioned earlier you're still looking towards 60-40 customer facing the task. Where do you stand today? And how much more of these 3 initiatives do you have to roll out the next quarter? And where do you think you'll stand after that?\nMarvin R. Ellison: TJ, we're going to end the year at roughly 55% and we're very pleased with that. When we started this a few years back, we were at 47% service to task. So we'll end this year at 55%. We think that we'll get north of 60% within the next 16 months. My team is responsible for working across, fortunately with Matt Carey's IT team, with Craig's team, to lay out initiatives for the upcoming years to keep this process growing. We don't see this as an endpoint. We see it is a continuous point of improvement. So we have initiatives that actually go through 2015. We're going to continue to drive productivity. We have a very simple philosophy of trying to take task out the store while driving productivity concurrently. And we've been very pleased with our payroll leverage and our ability to reduce overall payroll yet add hours to the sales force. So we're increasing coverage for service while reducing overall payroll because we're eliminating some of the tasks that in the past dominated all of our payroll staff.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from David Schick with Stifel.\nDavid A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Maybe if we could build on that. If you look at all the work you've done on the RDCs and distribution in general, but then combining it with what Marvin just talked about holistically on the efficiency of hours and tasking in the store, given the stage of all the work that you've done over several years, how should we think about the rate of change for both growth and leverage or just operating margin benefits of all that efficiency work in aggregate, the last couple of years versus next couple going forward?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, you'll recall when we had our Investor Day back in 2010, we said we'd get 40 basis points of margin expansion off of the supply chain. I think there is more upside opportunity to this than down just looking at the performance for the past 2 quarters, which gives us just a tremendous amount of confidence in our treck towards that 10% operating margin that we really believe we'll deliver by 2013.\nDavid A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And is the efficiency more targeted at just pure flow-through of gross? Or is it what it allows you to do labor-wise in the store? Or is that changing at all?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: I commented on the gross margin aspect, on the labor productivity. You're seeing it today. We leveraged hourly payroll in the quarter by about 38 basis points. So it was the key driver of the leverage that we experienced. And supply chain is a piece of this. All the new tools that Marvin and his team have introduced is another piece of it.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Greg Melich with ISI.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Two quick questions. One, could you just give us the actual numbers for the comp traffic in ticket in the U.S.?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: The actual numbers for the comp in the U.S., the comp ticket was up 2.7% and the transactions up 1.1%.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: On a comp basis. And then second is on SG&A, Carol, if I take the guidance of growing 20% of sales and just use your 2.5 for the year, I get deleverage in the fourth quarter. Is there -- is that because last year was so strong and that's just the flow-through to the SG&A side? Or is there something else that we're missing there?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, there's probably some modeling nuances going on because we're showing that we will leverage expenses in the fourth quarter.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then quickly then, credit, do you have the update on the credit penetration particularly given the strength in large ticket transactions?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Yes. We're very pleased with how our private label credit card is performing in this environment. We saw a slight tick down in penetration, about 17 basis points to 22.7%. But the reason why I say we're very encouraged and pleased with the performance is simply when we look at new accounts. As you may recall, we have a consumer card and a Pro card, and 70% of the penetration is on the consumer, 30% on the Pro. If we look at approval rates for our professional contractors, they're up 300 basis points year-over-year. That's great news because you know how important the Pro is to us. If we -- yes, it's great. If we look at approval rates for the consumer, however, they're down about 400 basis points. And the reason why they're down is because of the requirements pursuant to the CARD Act and the ability to pay. It's very cumbersome to apply for a consumer card in our stores and it's cumbersome on our part. It's cumbersome on the part of our underwriter. So we have a number of changes underway to make it less cumb ersome, and we believe that will help increase the approval rates. It's not that the quality of the applicants is bad. It's just they don't have all the information necessary to get approved. Now our approval rates are still pretty good. They're 71%. So that's still pretty good, but we think if we simplify it, we'll get it even better.\nOperator: We'll take our last question. We'll take that questions from Kate McShane from Citi Investment Research.\nKate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I was wondering if there was any more commentary about the successes that you're seeing with the Buy Online Pickup In-Store. Have you seen any increase in conversion as you get more people in the store with this initiative?\nCraig A. Menear: So we're pleased with how our total online business is progressing. We have currently about 9.5 million visitors to our site a week, which compares to about 6.5 million back in 2009. We continue to add SKUs to our business overall. We're north of roughly 300,000 SKUs at year end. And we made a number of changes to our site, as you probably have seen. So we're very pleased with the progress. We're obviously making an investment in our operating system right now, but our business hasn't reached $1 billion in total yet.\nMarvin R. Ellison: Kate, this is Marvin. We're very pleased just with the alignment. We talk about alignment a lot and we think that is a powerful component of success in our business, with the IT team, with Craig's team, with the dot com team. We have spent a lot of time, ensuring that we benchmark really good retailers not only in the U.S. but in Europe on how this process should work. The rollout was very smooth. The reception from our associates and customers have been very good, and we're excited about how well the stores are executing and how well the customer service feedback is coming back to us on how easy the process is and how transparent it is. So, so far, we're very pleased.\nDiane S. Dayhoff: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to talking with you throughout the quarter and in our fourth quarter earnings call, which would be in the month of February.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's teleconference.

If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387. Now before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided in the financial statements included with our earnings release. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrancis Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $20.2 billion, up 4.2% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.3% and our diluted earnings per share were $0.86. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 3.5%. From a geographic perspective, we saw positive comps in all but 3 of our top 40 markets, with particular strength in our Midwest and South Atlantic regions.  We are also encouraged that soft housing markets like California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada were positive in the quarter. And the spread of performance across our major markets continued to narrow. As we discussed in our first quarter call, we expected to see an improvement in sales in our northern division, following a very difficult spring season. And after a soft May, we did see that, with our northern division posting our strongest positive comps in the U.S. Our southern and western divisions were also positive, again reflecting a stabilizing environment across the country.  As Craig will detail, we saw strength in the core merchandising areas of our store, particularly in hardware, tools, building materials and electrical. We had a return to positive transaction growth in the quarter as well as an increase in average ticket. On the international front, our Canadian business had flat comps for the quarter, and our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps, making it 31 quarters in a row of positive comp growth. For the quarter, we also continued to invest in our core initiatives. Matt and our IT team, along with Craig and the merchandising team, made significant progress on our special order initiatives. We have now digitized all of our flooring and lighting catalogs and expect to have the rest of our catalog assortment digitized in the third quarter.  This will allow more accurate order entry for our associates, and it will also provide the foundation for a new special order sales dashboard that will give visibility into the sales performance of specific special order SKUs, a capability that will enable our merchants for the first time to have direct line of sight into their best and worst performing special order items. We are continuing with the rollout of our Buy Online Pickup In-Store, BOPIS capability. We have over 100 stores with BOPIS now, and our rollout will be complete in the third quarter. Even without marketing, we're seeing a strong interest in this capability. About 30% of the visitors on our website who use our check inventory functionality make the purchase in the store within 2 days.  We also see that a significant percent of BOPIS orders result in an additional purchase on the day of pickup. On the store operations side, Marvin and his team continue on the path of switching tasking hours to customer-facing hours. We have piloted a new scheduling system for our associates that will eliminate approximately 30 hours per store per week of manual scheduling activity.  The system has been very effective at both reducing the time required to create schedules and in making the schedules more visible and predictable for our associates. With the time saved on scheduling activity, we can increase the time allocated for customer-facing activity. We'll have this rolled out throughout the U.S. by the end of the year. Our supply chain efforts are delivering significant benefits to the business as we leverage supply chain expenses even in the face of increasing fuel costs. We have more opportunities to pursue, particularly in optimizing our supply chain goal of international product, and we are beginning the process of optimizing our supply chain in Canada as well. Balanced against the positive performance in the quarter and our progress against key initiatives, the U.S. housing market remains under stress. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP continues to set a 60-plus year low of 2.2%, and the key measures that helped in the housing market starts turnover in pricing remain depressed.  As we've discussed, we see our business is more correlated to GDP growth than housing statistics at the moment. But while our sales for the first half were consistent with our expectations, GDP growth was less than we expected. We do not expect any meaningful improvement in the housing market for the back half of 2011 and events here and across the globe would suggest that there are more risks to the downside than the upside on GDP growth. But both of those conditions were also true for the first half, and we saw steady strength in the core of our store. We have no reason to change that expectation for the back half.  As Carol will detail, we are maintaining our sales guidance for the year and increasing our earnings guidance to reflect our second quarter results. And we will continue to invest in and position our business for recovery. I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work in the second quarter. Due to their efforts, 92% of our stores will be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. We are very proud of that accomplishment. With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid performance in the second quarter driven by 3 factors. First, the seasonal business and outdoor projects. Second, the repair business from harsh winter and spring storms and finally, the continued strength in our core departments.  During the quarter, we saw strong sales across many of our key departments with outperformance with the company average comp in building materials, electrical, kitchens, indoor garden, outdoor garden and tools. Hardware performed at the company average. Paint, plumbing and flooring delivered positive comps, but less than the company average. Comps in lighting were flat, while comps in lumber and millwork were negative for the quarter.  As spring arrived, customers are focused on gardening outdoor projects. This business was especially strong in the northern division. Examples of categories that delivered solid comp performance were exterior paint, exterior stains, live goods, landscape, fencing and concrete. In addition, customers continue to respond to great values and innovation in grills and patio products. We leveraged the capability of our merchandising tools at a new level in the first half.  Category assortments were planned and in more detailed level than in the past. Using outdoor patio category as an example, we plan not only dining and seating combinations by local store, but also cushions, umbrellas and chairs. Another capability merchants had was the ability to more quickly identify trends at a local store level. This allowed merchants to make assortment adjustments during the selling season and before the season was over. These capabilities continued to add value for both our customers and shareholders. Widespread heat, as the quarter progressed, drove strong performance in ceiling fans, air-conditioners and portable fans. Our air movement product category sold double-digit positive comps and contributed approximately 30 basis points to U.S. comps in the second quarter. Watering and irrigation products also delivered positive comp performance, especially in our southern division.  Additionally, we had good performance in appliances, driven by outstanding values and in part by refrigeration sales due to increasing replacement needs caused by soaring temperatures. We anticipate that the need for repairing damage done by harsh weather, as North America came out of the winter thaw, customers needed to repair or replace snow damage rust, gutters, lawns and live goods. Violent tornadoes and storms in the spring increased roofing repair sales to customers in the southern division.  In addition, floods across the country resulted in the purchases of cleaning supplies, pumps and pressure washers. Performance in our core departments of electrical, hardware, paint and plumbing continue to be encouraging. Products such as portable power, power tool accessories, hand tools, fastening tools, conduit boxes, circuit protection devices, adhesive tapes and compressors were positive performers in the second quarter.  Based on independent third-party tracking of consumer activity, we gained unit share in 5 of 13 departments during the second quarter: flooring, plumbing, electrical, lighting and kitchens. At the end of the first quarter, we chose to carry more inventory and keep our stores fully stocked with seasonal products. This was the right decision.  Improvements in the weather, combined with our merchandising tools and enhanced transportation network allowed us to end the first half with inventory turns flat to last year. The cornerstone of our end-to-end supply chain transformation, the 19 Rapid Deployment Centers, is performing better than we planned. We are improving delivery and service to U.S. stores and at the same time leveraging the cost of moving goods. While we expect the RDCs to continue to provide cost leverage, we have several more supply chain projects underway in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which will improve the efficiency in handling of our goods. Our average ticket increased 3.3% and total customer transactions grew by 1.1%.  At the beginning of the year, we believe transaction improvement would lead to sales growth in the first half of the year, and improvement in average ticket would be more sustaining in the back half of the year. However, average ticket was more of a driver in the first half of the year than we anticipated, due both to mix and price. For example, transactions of tickets over $900, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 5.4% in the second quarter.  In regard to price, we have talked to you in the past about how we manage retail price through a \"portfolio\" strategy and our approach to addressing vendor cost increase request. In situations where we took a cost increase and pushed it through to the retail price, it had some impact on ticket growth, but was not the principal driver. We are well positioned to drive average ticket and transactions in the third quarter. Being the pioneer of Vanity Insanity, our bath event is in stores now and has been expanded to include great values in faucets, toilets, tile and lighting. During the third quarter, customers will also be offered great values and special buys during our fall cleanup season.  Innovation plays a big role for us in driving sales. For our professional customers, we are rolling out the DEWALT hand tools, exclusive to The Home Depot and DEWALT's new line of 20-volt lithium-ion power tools. The new 20-volt lithium-ion battery has 35% more runtime and is approximately 35% lighter than its current lithium product. Hand tools, including DEWALT's utility knife that features blades 35% sharper, 20% stronger and 75% longer-lasting than traditional utility blades. We also have new product introductions in our decor lineup. We're introducing the Home Decorators Collection premium faux wood blinds at great value with added features. Innovation also extends beyond just the product. Our new blind cutting machine simplifies the cutting process, saving our associates time and better servicing our customers. We continue to be the leader in paint for our customers. We introduced Martha Stewart Living specialty finishes and metallic paints and glazes, glitter paints and texture paints along the specialty applicators.  With specialty finishes and a few simple tools, do-it-yourselfers can transform a plain wall with texture, dimension and light to make a whole room look as if it were professionally decorated. In addition, we're introducing innovative Trim & Door paint by Glidden, another exclusive to Home Depot. This paint has unique Gel-Flow Technology that will not drip and does not leave brush marks while drying with a high-gloss, glasslike finish. We're really excited about the products and values we have to offer our customers in the upcoming months, and with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $20.2 billion, up 4.2% from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 4.3% for the quarter with 1.8% comps in May, 6.2% comps in June and 4.9% comps in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 3.5% for the quarter, with U.S. comps up 0.8% in May, 5.7% in June and 4% in July. In the second quarter, our gross margin was 34%, an increase of 8 basis points from last year, of which 11 basis points of growth was driven by our U.S. business, offset by 3 basis points of contraction arising from our Canadian business. In the U.S., benefits arising from our supply chain transformation drove 26 basis points of margin expansion. This expansion was offset in part by 15 basis points of gross margin contraction, arising primarily from a shift in the mix of products sold.  As Craig described, in the second quarter, our strongest selling categories were lower margin categories like building materials, outdoor garden and appliances. For the year, we continue to expect modest gross margin expansion. Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 70 basis points to 22.6%. Our expense leverage reflects about 50 basis points of leverage arising from positive same-store sales, the majority of which was in hourly payroll. The remaining 20 basis points of expense leverage can be explained by the following factors. First, we realized 12 basis points of leverage in medical expense due to a lower cost per participant, among other factors. Second, we realized 13 basis points of leverage and depreciation expense arising from fully depreciated assets. And third, we experienced 11 basis points of leverage arising from favorable casualty estimates. These 3 items were offset by 16 basis points of expense deleverage arising from a $32 million asset impairment charge. In the second quarter, we wrote down our investment in a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business. It is our intent to sell this business. Based on our first half results, we don't believe we will have as much expense pressure as we thought at the beginning of the year, especially in the area of medical and payroll tax expense. For the year, we now expect the total expenses to grow at approximately 30% of our sales growth rate. Interest and other expense for the second quarter totaled $146 million, about the same as last year. Our income tax provision rate was 36.5% in the second quarter. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 37%. Earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.86, up 19.4% from last year.  Now moving to our operational metrics, during the quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico and closed one store that was destroyed by a tornado in Joplin, Missouri for an ending store count of 2,245. While our Joplin store was destroyed, we do have a temporary structure serving that community and have already begun construction on a replacement store.  At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 235 million, and total sales per square foot were $343. Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory remains in good shape. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $10.8 billion, down $3 million from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.4x, flat to last year. For the year, we anticipate a small improvement in inventory turnover. We ended the quarter with $42.3 billion in assets, including $2.6 billion in cash. On the capital structure front, a few items of note. First, in the second quarter, we repurchased $1 billion or 28.1 million shares of outstanding stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $2.3 billion or 63.4 million shares. Second, we ended the quarter with approximately $10.7 billion of outstanding long-term debt, of which the earliest maturity is $1.3 billion coming due in December 2013. And finally, computed on the average of beginning and ending, long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 13.5%, 200 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2010. In February, we told you that our 2011 capital spending plan was $1,350,000,000. We now believe that our 2011 capital expenditures will be $1,275,000,000, primarily as a result of fewer new stores and the new store opening pipeline.  As of the first half of 2011, we have spent $469 million in capital, as our spending plan was weighted toward the back half of the year. In the second quarter and for the first half of 2011, our sales performance disconnected from U.S. GDP growth. We expect that certain quarters will exhibit such a disconnect, as there are factors such as weather related sales, storm damage related sales and event driven sales that on a short-term basis can't be matched to any specific economic statistic.  Because of these factors, we still project that our fiscal 2011 sales growth will be approximately 2.5%. While there may be more downside risks than upside risks to this forecast, our business continues to perform to our expectations and comp sales thus far into August are quite positive. From an earnings per share perspective, remember that we guide off of GAAP. Based on our first half results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we now project fiscal 2011 earnings per share from continuing operations to increase approximately 16% to $2.34. In our earnings per share guidance, we are not including the impact of any additional share repurchases outside of those executed in the first half. But it is our intent to use excess cash to repurchase shares and are targeting approximately $1.2 billion of additional share repurchases for the remainder of the year. So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And Alicia, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co: First, since you opened up the dialogue, just curious if you could elaborate on what exactly quite positive means in terms of August trend, because obviously, we're all very focused on if the markets had any impact to your sales? And then my follow-up is on gross margin. A lot of questions after your competitors call yesterday exactly what the pricing environment is, is it becoming irrational? So in that, did you see any promotional pressure, unexpected promotional pressure? Has the environment changed? And also, did you see any fuel pressure in your cost of goods?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, I'll start with an answer to your first question. Based on the guidance that we have given you, it implies a 3% comp in the back half of the year, and that's where we're trending. So from that perspective, it's quite positive.\nCraig Menear: This is Craig. Overall, from promotional activity market, really seems to be pretty common to what we've seen so far in the year, haven't really experienced any big differences at all.\nFrancis Blake: And as it relates, I think, Mark, if you want to talk about fuel pressure?\nMark Holifield: Right. In terms of the fuel pressure, the 26 basis points of supply chain improvement came after offsetting 9 basis points of fuel price pressure.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: I guess my question, you've commented before that you feel like you've disconnected from the housing market now it seems that you've disconnected from GDP a little bit, I mean I guess the question is what are you guys using as a kind of a guide post for kind of your same-store sales performance at this stage?\nFrancis Blake: So Scott, I'd say, and to Carol's comments, I'm not sure we're not saying we're disconnected from GDP. There are always some events within quarters that explain ups and downs. So we think for our results, it's still going to be very important that we see GDP growth. At the same time, we also think our job with all of you is to report on what we're observing. And we observe strength in the second quarter even as GDP was under some pressure.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then any other color on the growth in transaction size will be fantastic, because obviously that's something, was it a big driver of the quarter?\nFrancis Blake: Yes. In terms of transactions, we talked about the fact that there'd be a little bit of a bathtub effect in the half. And as the garden business strengthened in the second quarter, that is obviously a significant part of the transaction growth that takes place. Certainly, in outdoor garden, for example, a lot of our customers were out making repairs. But we also saw strength across the store as well, and the core of our store performed well, which is also a driver to transactions.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gary Balter from Credit Suisse.\nSimeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: It's Simeon Gutman for Gary. Following up on the gross margin, how did the mix typically go from I guess the seasonal perspective? Should the mix change from summer into fall, be positive? And does that mean in the context of gross margins being up modestly for the year, that maybe the 2Q gain will represent a low point?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Right. If I could just tell you what our forecast is, year-to-date our gross margin is up 16 basis points. We would define 16 basis points as modest. So that gives you a feel for what the back half will look like.\nSimeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Okay. And then I guess a quick follow-up for maybe Craig or whoever. Having gone through the process of trying to push through some of the price increases that you went through in the first half of the year and maybe now having a better understanding of the sensitivity to some of those, is there more room to optimize gross margin in the next couple of periods and should that be a positive flow through?\nCraig Menear: Yes, I mean we are constantly focused on making sure that we're driving value for our customer every day. My message to the merchant team continually is you are the customer's advocate for value, and we will deal with cost pressures as they come up individually, supplier by supplier, do everything we can working with the suppliers to try to find ways to squeeze out unnecessary cost to maintain value for our customer.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And clearly, you can see the benefits of our supply chain.\nGary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: This is Gary. Just following up. On the distribution side, everything is in place now, you're starting to see some of the benefits, as you mentioned, in the supply chain. As you examine it, how much more is there than you thought there was when you first started the project?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, Gary, as we've commented, we're very pleased with our supply chain performance, and it's exceeding our expectations. We've got a lot on the docket. We're not done in terms of transforming supply chain. One of the key benefits that we're seeing year-over-year is just an increase in the percent of goods that are handled by our central supply chain, including our bulk distribution centers, et cetera. So we've gone from about 50% centrally managed to now 63%. There's more room for opportunity here. We're not ready to lift the guidance that we've given, but certainly there's room for opportunity.\nOperator: We'll go next to Alan Rifkin from Barclays.\nAlan Rifkin: Early this year, you folks commented that you had been seeing stabilization with respect to vendor request on increasing prices. I was wondering if you can give us an update on what you've seen from the vendor community lately.\nFrancis Blake: Yes, that did, Alan, stable out in the second quarter. There is still requests that come in, but prior to the beginning of the year, those requests were on the rise, and we actually saw that stable and flatten out in the second quarter.\nAlan Rifkin: Okay. So the 3% comp forecast that you're guiding to for the second half, does not include any inflationary element in it?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It really doesn't. The way that we get to the 3%, to Frank's point about the observation is we've deconstructed the sales in the second quarter, backing out some of the weather-related sales, heat weather-related sales, and that takes our U.S. comp to slightly under 2%. And then we walked back up over 2% because of some additional storm-related sales, some of that related sales, and remember, as you know, we are now anniversarying lumber price inflation since lumber prices are up year-on-year. So we get to a U.S. comp that's north of 2%, you add to that some currency benefit and you're up 3%.\nAlan Rifkin: Okay. And one more, if I may. I mean we certainly appreciate your modesty with respect to sales disconnecting from GDP as well as PFRI, but to be fair, putting the weather issues aside, it appears that your business is at the core strengthening. I mean would there be anything that you guys are seeing other than the obvious effects of whether that would lead you to believe that maybe going forward your sales can continue to disconnect from GDP and PFRI, as they certainly have been doing in the first half?\nFrancis Blake: We cannot say -- we haven't reached a conclusion that our sales disconnect from GDP. We still think our business, when you think about it, we need GDP growth. We need the economy doing well. Obviously, the discretionary purchases from our consumers is a key driver of our business. So we don't, I mean again, Carol kind of walked through there are some unique things that happen within quarters, but we would not be saying that our business grows regardless of what's happening with GDP.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I'd like to focus on first, if I can, on your improvement in average ticket over the course of the quarter, rather from quarter-to-quarter that kind of stands in contrast what one would expect from the macro backdrop. So if you could talk about the drivers that'd be great.\nCraig Menear: Sure, Matt, this is Craig. Let's start with, really we saw improvement across the store, quite frankly with the exception of lumber and millwork. So it really was somewhat broad-based across the store.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And was that within categories or was it more reflective of mix?\nCraig Menear: It was a combination of mix as well as within category. Examples of within category would be things like inside the patio, inside the grills, where we actually saw a benefit inside the mix of sale.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Got it. And then my second question follow-up, if you will, relates to your fourth quarter, the third quarter compare looks a lot like the second quarter compare and it sounds like you have good visibility to the store to the quarter. Last year, you promoted pretty aggressively in some holiday-oriented categories early in the season and wondering how you're thinking about the marketing plan to cycle that as you move into Q4 of 11.\nFrancis Blake: We feel very good about our key holiday businesses, things around holiday decorating, around our gift centers, and we've actually bought up double-digit in those areas.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Does that include the appliance business?\nFrancis Blake: No, I mean we have different model in appliances.\nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Lasser from UBS.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank: Frank, the business really seems to be humming recently. Do you take this as an opportunity to maybe take a couple of bigger swings either on the promotional front or the inventory side? Is there any way you can use this time as a way to expand the competitive mode and further distance you from the competition?\nFrancis Blake: So Mike, I guess, I'd say more. We've got a basic business strategy that we run consistently. We are obviously pleased with the results for the quarter, but that just says we keep at it. I mean we just keep at it. So there's nothing we're saying, \"Okay, now let's take some swing for the fence.\"\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank: No real change in posture? Nothing to suggest?\nFrancis Blake: No, sir.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank: Then on the longer term outlook, obviously, it's very confusing especially with the prospect to subpar GDP growth would seems like a societal movement towards renting a home versus owning a home. So under those type of conditions, do you think that the home improvement market can generate a 2% to 3% long-term growth rate if maybe overall GDP is close to the 2%?\nFrancis Blake: Well, with respect to the home ownership and renting, I mean we have seen a decline in the percent of the population that owns homes. But people who rent also do upgrades, the folks who own those rental units have -- there's actually a lot of wear and tear on rental units, and we can feel some of that need. And I'd also say, one of the comments just on the general market is there's been a huge upsurge, several millions of folks now living in multigenerational homes. That's just the kind way of saying kids living with their parents. And that is not a great long-term solution. I'm sure from either the kids' or the parents' perspective, so they're looking to go out and have new places to live as the economy improves.\nOperator: We'll go next to Deborah Weinswig from Citi.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: So in terms of the Pro customer, can you talk about the strength here and anything particular to note in terms of the trends?\nFrancis Blake: So Deborah, a couple of points on that, and then I'll turn it to Marvin to give you some comments on what we're doing operationally. We had, for a period of time, some very definitive statistics around what was happening with our Pro customers, and that was when we were using dunnhumby for data analysis. We've taken that in-house, but it's taken a while for us to kind of replicate the same who's a Pro and the whole data crunching effort there. So we don't have very good specific data yet on kind of year-over-year or month-over-month Pro sales performance. We hope to have that very soon, but we are doing a lot operationally that we think is working and working well, and I'd ask Marvin just to comment on that.\nMarvin Ellison: Thanks, Frank. Deborah, we went back and we did a lot of surveys of our key Pro customers, so just to understand what they wanted from retail to better serve them, and we rolled out something we mentioned a while back, our First for Pro, a take-on of our customer service initiative. The good news is that our greatest customer service improvement in the store happened in the Pro side of the store in the second quarter. Our Net Promoter Score increased by 270 basis points, our weighted checkout was dramatically improved, our healthiness in loading are just across the board, so we feel really good about Pro and good about the service model that we put in Pro. The key goal for us this year is continue to engage our customers, understand the projects they're we're working on and more importantly, give them a very convenient retail environment to shop in because time is money and they want to get in and out fast. As Frank mentioned, we'll have a better view on the overall sales trajectory as we continue to crunch the data in-house, and we feel very pleased with our progress thus far.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: For my follow-up question, Craig, you talked about the ability to identify trends and make adjustments in season. Can you maybe share some color on some of those adjustments that were made in season?\nCraig Menear: Yes. We did look at things happening inside of our outdoor living categories, for example, made assortment adjustments and our growth at store level, we made assortment adjustments within things like outdoor power equipment.\nOperator: We'll go next to Greg Melich from ISI.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group Inc.: Could you give us some detail on the comp traffic in the U.S.? I think you gave the transactions number. It sound like a global number and also what inflation or deflation data in the quarter.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Right. So the comp traffic in the U.S. was about 0.9%. And then in terms of inflation or deflation, it's hard to really quantify that as you can appreciate. We could comment a little bit about our commodity categories that might be helpful. So remember, you may remember a year ago, we had 100 basis points of benefits from lumber price inflation. This year, we had about 70 basis points of comp contraction because of deflation. But that was offset for the most part by inflation that we saw in copper, so when we look at commodities in total, we say it's basically flat.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group Inc.: Got it. And as a follow-up, trying to get that ticket back, you know the consumer has been, at least up until last quarter or 2, are very hesitant to use credit again. Did that turn around the quarter? Did people want to use their Home Depot credit cards and what was credit penetration up to?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. We saw a slight uptick in our private label credit penetration, which we were happy about, of course, because it is our lowest cost of tender. So that private label penetration as of the end of the second quarter is 21.5%.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group Inc.: Great. So you did see a tick up?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group Inc.: Did you have anything special on the card to change there, especially given what your competitor is up to or are you still the same?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: No. As you know, we view broad-based discounting with caution. We use our card as a financing tool. We certainly think our card is a great value proposition, and we do try shut that out every day. But it is a financing tool.\nOperator: We'll go next to Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Just you gave the over $900 comp. Can you usually give the under $50 comp too, just for completeness, can you do that?\nFrancis Blake: Sure. And it's basically flat.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And you talked, Craig, about kitchen being strong, and I think you also talked about appliances or refrigeration being strong. Can you kind of maybe go into that a bit because with the economy the way it is and that overall industry feeling some pressure, I'd love to see what you did there?\nCraig Menear: Sure. Yes, we look at our kitchen business in total. We did have positive growth in our kitchen business. I think that's a result of the hard work the team has put in over the past few years to be able to really offer a wide range of kitchen open options for our customers, anything from an assembled cabinet, take it home, start today, if you want to refinish or simply replace doors and fronts, all the way to semi-custom. And the customer has responded well to that value proposition and those options in the market. And we did see growth in our appliance business. There's always a little bit of a spike in the summer timeframe against refrigeration because heat puts pressure on the obvious mechanics of older refrigerators. And we did well in that product category.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Just one more, if I can sneak it in, the Net Promoter Score, what was it in the quarter?\nMarvin Ellison: The Net Promoter Score was a 68.7, and that's an increase of 210 basis points, and I have to note that, that's on top of a 530 basis point increase, same quarter last year. Real progress.\nOperator: We'll go next to Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: In terms of merchandising, kind of earlier you mentioned Vanity Insanity, and I'm interested in what your thoughts are about your merchandising and promotional strategy into the back half of the year, and then also interested, obviously, over the last 2 years, you've made a great deal of market share progress relative to the prior 6 or 7 years. I'm wondering, as you look back at that and look forward what you think is driving that and if there are specific things you're doing to sustain or expand that?\nFrancis Blake: So starting with the progress, obviously, we implemented a \"portfolio\" approach a few years ago, really looking hard at what we wanted to stand for, where we wanted to invest. That then dictated what we had to do as it related to really looking at decisions around assortment, that of assortment, go-to-market strategies, how we present the products in the store, and that has served us well. And we have worked hard to work on the productivity of our assortments inside the bays, and we'll continue to remain focused there as we go forward. If you think, look at things like our Vanity Insanity again, start with what I said earlier, our focus as merchants has to be the customers' advocate for value. A long traditional history inside of Home Depot is to drive value for our customers, to look for opportunities, to work with our suppliers, to drive productivity in their factories, creating things like special buys that helps them leverage productivity and gives us the chance to give the customer a great value. And that's what we see in things like Vanity Insanity, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities. We have several of them in-play for the fall season to continue to drive the business and drive urgency within the business.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I think Craig you would agree that market gains have come about not just with merchandising but also with the great customer service, the operators, our in stock position is as good as it's ever been. So as a company working together, I think we're really making some progress.\nCraig Menear: Yes, Eric, to Carol's point, I mean retail is, really candidly, like baking a cake, and you got to get all the ingredients right to really drive the business, and I think that's Carol's absolutely correct. It's all of those things combined.\nOperator: We'll go next to Laura Champine from Cowen and Company.\nLaura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC: In flooring where you're taking share, what changes have you made there? And do you think those share gains are being driven by values or by broadened assortment?\nFrancis Blake: I think it's a combination of both. We have been working hard on our assortments over the past several years in our flooring business, outstanding values with our Platinum Plus and Martha carpet program. We've worked hard on our assortments in tile, whether that's in ceramic, porcelain, mosaics, wood, laminate, combinations of enhancing the assortment as well as driving special buys. So that's really a combination of all those things that has allowed us to really improve that business over the years.\nLaura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC: And in flooring, but more of an overall follow-up, you find yourselves using more vendors or leveraging your size with fewer vendors?\nFrancis Blake: I would say it really varies by category. And in some categories, we've actually expanded the vendor base. In other categories, we've actually contracted.\nLaura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC: And can you comment specifically on flooring?\nFrancis Blake: Flooring is pretty much the same.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Frank, I guess just big picture what you've talked about with comps and sort of the different macro factors. It seems like the business is sort of in this 1% to 2% range now for several quarters, even though the housing market's been pretty choppy, and we've seen the economy slow down. The consumer certainly seems to be under more pressure recently. Yet you haven't necessarily seen that impact on your business. So is that another way of saying that we're sort of out of the maintenance type level of spending, and would suggest that there's less sensitivity to a downturn? Just wondered if you agree with that or your thoughts around the topic. And then along those lines, if we are in a situation where the consumer spending declines next year, maybe we double dip modestly, can you just talk about the ability to manage expenses and how we should think about operating margin in a down comp environment?\nFrancis Blake: First, Dennis on the question of whether we're at the maintenance spending level, I'd say we're still very cautious before we'd say something like that. Again, there's just, it's still kind of early. And as I've said before in answers to the other questions, we still think that there's a connection between our business and GDP growth. So I wouldn't want to suggest that regardless of what's happening in the general economy, that our business has hit sort of the basic maintenance spend. For sure, it's encouraging that as in this past quarter, we see kind of the core of the business hold up strong. It's encouraging that we see the spread narrowing across the country in terms of performance. So you're not seeing these dramatic swings that we've been seeing in prior years. So those are all encouraging signs, but I just provide some caution in looking at them, and we still think the general economy is important to us. In terms of -- I don't want to get into a hypothetical on what would happen with a double-dip recession. So for our business, we always have opportunities to improve. So we'll look at that regardless of what the economy throws at us.\nOperator: We'll go next to Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group.\nJoseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group: Just wanted to ask a little more on the expense control, which has been very good, and you're still planning to grow expenses at 30% of sales for the year. That's even better than what it had been before. I guess our concern was you made a comment that look you still think total sales, there's more risk to the downside, and as much as we know, churns are good right now. Let's say they do fall off. I guess within that 30%, how much of that I guess is fixed versus variable? Like where do you -- do you have enough room to keep adjusting to maintain that net 30% level?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, remember that our largest expense is payroll, and we do have an activity-based model. And so we can adjust payroll based on the activity we see in our stores. The other components of expenses that are variable would certainly be advertising and that would also flex relative to where our sales are going. So we feel very comfortable about the guidance that we've given to you today.\nJoseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group: Got it. And then also like a follow-up, with the ticket and transactions have been good, and I guess are you seeing customers that you haven't seen in a while or so-called new customers or new households coming back? Especially with the way those trends are, it would seem, and with those promoter scores, it seems like things are really on an upswing. I'm just curious about that.\nCraig Menear: We really don't have a way of judging that, so I can't give you a good statistic on who we think are returning customers versus new customers.\nMarvin Ellison: And Joe, this is Marvin. The general approach that we take is just provide great service, and we know that customers will traditionally shop for home improvement 4 to 5x a year. And we want those occasions to be with us, and we think by engaging them and giving them a great service environment, we have a great opportunity to get them on that next shopping occasion. So whether they\u2019re new customers or not, we focus on our customers in a very aggressive service mentality, hoping that we can just retain them and continue to provide an opportunity for them to come back and shop with us again.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG: So just a clarity on the expense question, that 30% growth number relative to sales, that's for this year, is that something that we should plan on ongoing as we look out ahead? And then I guess a follow-up, but related to that, are there more examples that you could provide where you're seeing some inefficiencies in the store that you can fix, for instance the labor scheduling that Frank alluded to earlier, and I know in the past you've talked about processing returns at the store level. Are there still more examples of those where you guys can become more cost efficient and keep that ratio down?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, regarding expenses, we've said as a general rule of thumb, expenses would grow in the area of 50% of our sales growth. Obviously we're doing better than that. And there are some reasons for that. While we thought we would have pressure from medical expense this year, we're actually seeing relief from the medical expense line, if you will. And so where that goes in outer years, not sure, but we certainly have done some great things here, getting our associates to be more healthy, and if they're more healthy, our costs go down. And we'll continue those efforts. So maybe our rule of thumb will change in the outer years, but right now, Michael, for your modeling purposes, I would use that for outer years. And then in terms of what we're doing in the store, well Marvin's on the path to get to 60-40, so he might talk about that.\nMarvin Ellison: Mike, when we laid out a pretty aggressive plan a few years back to shift our payroll model from a task, what I call noncustomer service activities, which was at 60% to flip that and make that activity to be customer-facing over a period of time. We're over 50% now, which is a great milestone. And when you think about some of the key initiatives, we have a new labor system that Frank mentioned that will really transform how we schedule, and give associates the ability to view schedules from home, just a great piece of technology that we believe will make us best-in-class from a retail payroll management standpoint. We have -- are rolling out centralized return to the vendor process. Today, we process returns individually in 2,000 stores in the U.S. We're going to create 3 large central locations and all stores will be processed in those locations. It's going to be a huge productivity and payroll savings. We're revamping our entire toolroom system, which saves a transaction from 8 minutes to approximately one minute. That's going to happen this year as well. Frank mentioned Buy Online Pickup In-Store. We waited a lot to roll this out, but we want it to be very good and have a process that will create differentiation, and we believe we've done that, and we'll have that rolled out within the next couple of months in all stores. As Carol mentioned, we have a project plan for the next 2 years with projects similar to the ones I just outlined that we think will be very beneficial for us to continue to transform our store environment, drive our payroll productivity and just create a better service environment for the customers.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG: So it sounds like one of those are happening now or still ahead of you. Is that fair to say?\nMarvin Ellison: The ones I outlined are happening as we speak.\nOperator: We'll go next to David Schick from Stiefel.\nDavid Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Frank, would be interested in your thoughts on long-term, 5 or 10 years out, how important is Mexico and the Internet or online sales to this business?\nFrancis Blake: Well, 2 different answers. First, we obviously think both are very important, but in different ways. The Internet is going to be important for every part of our business. Marvin was just going through one example with Buy Online Pickup In-Store. But we have an entire focus here around what we call interconnected retail because we think online, online, for us, is not just a matter of selling online. Customers research online, they get project knowledge online. So there's a lot of ways in which our bricks connect with our online presence, and we want to make sure we have the best experience in all of retail for that. On Mexico, Mexico has just been a great, great story for us. The business has grown well. We've also been able to learn a lot in terms of, I mean, it is not just a matter of the team here helping in Mexico, but frankly, we probably get more help coming back the other way. Our Mexican business helps us think through customer, Hispanic customers in the U.S. are obviously a huge demographic opportunity. On personnel, we transfer personnel back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico, which is great. We do that both on the merchandising side, the operations side, the finance side, we do that across the business. So we look at Mexico as just absolutely a critical part of the overall business and see continued growth for it.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you for listening to us today. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today's discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you, Yvonne, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot first quarter earnings conference call. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analysts' questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up. The conference call is being broadcast real time on the Internet at earnings.com -- earnings.homedepot.com. The replay will also be available on our site. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided in the financial statements included with our earnings release. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrancis Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $16.8 billion, down 0.2% from last year. Comp sales were negative 0.6% and our diluted earnings per share were $0.50. Our U.S. stores had a negative comp of 0.7%. We had expected to post a positive comp for the quarter despite the difficult year-over-year comparison with a strong first quarter in 2010. Carol and Craig will provide more detail but the dominant factor impacting us this past quarter was weather. Both our southern and western divisions posted positive comps for the quarter but our northern division had a difficult spring and particularly a difficult April as weather was colder and wetter than last year. Since the northern division is our largest division, this was determinative for our overall results. Non-weather-related categories such as electrical, tools and kitchens performed well versus our plan and versus last year. But our garden categories had negative comps and there were impacts throughout our business for products related to outdoor projects.  On a geographic basis, roughly 40% of our U.S. regions are in our northern division, and they all negatively comped. This same pattern was reflected in our top 40 markets.  On a positive note, we saw strength in areas of the country with good weather and in some of the hardest-hit housing markets like Phoenix, Orlando, Miami and Los Angeles. Texas was also an area of strength. It doesn't feel good to post a negative comp and it doesn't feel good to provide weather reports, but weather aside, there were some encouraging signs from the quarter. It is useful to remember that we anniversaried not only the U.S. homebuyer tax credit, but also the strong run-up in lumber pricing from last year.  Also, GDP was not as strong as predicted in the first quarter and the housing market remains in the doldrums. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP continues to be at its historic low of 2.2%. In that context, the performance in the first quarter was reasonably encouraging and supportive of our forecast for the year of sales growth in the 2.5% range. Operationally, we continue to make progress on our initiatives. Marvin and his team launched our centralized return to vendor project, which we think will improve in-store customer service and productivity. He also began the rollout of our First for Pro program, which is designed to drive increased customer satisfaction with our Pro segment just as our general Customer First program has improved satisfaction levels with our Consumer segment. While we're still early in the process, Pro satisfaction scores have improved.  As we've discussed before, we completed the physical construction of our Rapid Deployment Centers, RDCs, in January of this year. In many ways though, this is just the start of our supply chain improvement efforts. We are now focused on increasing the product flow through the RDCs.  During the first quarter, we increased flow by 80% through the RDC network. We are also implementing a new forecasting and replenishment system for RDCs so that our store and DC systems will be integrated. This is an important step in improving the throughput and productivity of our supply chain.  Craig and his team continue to gain traction on our merchandising tools. As we mentioned, we believe we have a significant opportunity to improve our special order performance. As part of that effort, we are digitizing our vendor catalogs and we're now about 20% complete. This will make the special order process both simpler and more accurate for our associates and give our merchants greater visibility into special order pricing and performance. We are also building out our customer order management capabilities step-by-step. This is something we've tried several times in the past to achieve with a big bang change without success. We're very pleased that with Matt and his team, we're already seeing sequential improvement in creating and tracking our special order quotes.  We have begun the rollout of our Buy Online Pickup In-Store capability. Other retailers already have this. Our goal is to deliver a best in class interconnected retail experience for our customers, and we plan to have this rollout completed by the end of the year. On the international front, our Mexican business posted positive comps. This is the 30th quarter in a row of positive comps for Ricardo Saldivar and his team, a truly impressive performance. Our Canadian business had negative comps for the quarter as Canada experienced the same harsh spring as the northern U.S. We are also lapping last year's carryover from the Home Renovation Tax Credit.  We have a new leader in Canada, Bill Lennie, who, as many of you know, was previously a merchandising Senior Vice President in the U.S. And finally, our business in China is beginning to stabilize. We have reduced our footprint there to 2 principal cities and are pleased with the progress we're making as the majority of stores are now positively comping.  I want to thank our associates for all their hard work and effort during this quarter. Based on this quarter's results, 73% of our stores would be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates, and we certainly expect this percentage to increase by the end of the first half.  I also want to give a special thanks to all of our associates who are in the tornado- and flood-impacted areas of our country. We are very proud of their efforts to help in their communities during times of disaster. Helping in times of need has been a core part of The Home Depot culture since its founding.  And now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Comps for the quarter came in slightly below our expectations. While we anticipated tough comparisons in the first quarter, most of the miss to expectations was related to weak performance in our indoor and outdoor garden categories, particularly in the northern division.  This is a result of the winter that wouldn't end. You can see the impact of weather in our transaction count, which was down 1.9% year-over-year in the first quarter. On the positive side, total company average ticket was up 1.5% or $0.81 to $53.35 for the first quarter, driven for the most part by strength in nonseasonal and non-commodity categories.  Before we get into the department results, let me comment on the request from vendors for price increases. On our last earnings call, I'd mentioned that we were seeing an elevated number of these requests due to increasing raw material costs. These requests continued throughout the first quarter. However, we are starting to see the number of requests flatten out. We review each of these requests on an individual basis and our portfolio strategy drives our go-to-market actions, as it has in the past. Though we were pleased with the results in our core businesses, during the quarter, we saw strength across many of our key categories with electrical, kitchens, tools, plumbing, paint and flooring posting positive comps. Hardware also outperformed the company's average comp for the quarter. And excluding outdoor categories, we would have exceeded our sales plan for the quarter.  We are seeing ongoing trend of maintenance and repair categories performing well. Categories that drove positive growth related to maintenance and repair include pipe and fittings, light bulbs, appliance parts, cleaning and plumbing repair. Simple decor categories also continued to perform well. We saw positive comps across all hard surface categories and flooring as well as organization, interior paint and faucets.  Our customers responded to our pipeline of innovative products. Strong sales of both our EcoSmart and Philips LED light bulbs drove the LED subclass of light bulbs to over 500% growth year-over-year. Additionally, we have seen success from products like our new line of Milwaukee Red Lithium portable power tools, powered by the leading lithium technology available. And our strong performance in Power Tool Accessories during the quarter was driven by new innovative products such as Milwaukee's Shockwave Impact Bits and the Diablo Carbide-tipped Recip [Reciprocating] Blades. We have yet to see a full recovery with the Pro customer or large discretionary projects. However, we are seeing customers respond to value. We saw double-digit positive comps in almost every component of our Kitchen business during the first quarter. And we believe this is a result of exceptional offerings combined with store execution. While the overall market for kitchen remodels is still depressed, we are taking share in a tough environment due to our great value proposition.  Additionally, we saw excellent results from our Husky line of soft-sided tool storage and our exclusive line of USG lightweight drywall, both examples of value at higher-end price points. Finally, we are completing the rollout of our KILZ PRO-X, our new line of Pro paint, and we're looking forward to driving the business with our Pro customers through this product introduction. As I mentioned, our Seasonal business was under significant pressure in the first quarter. We are encouraged, however, by the performance of this business where we had more typical weather conditions. For example, in our southern division, we saw mid-single-digit positive comps in outdoor garden led by Chemicals, Landscape, Seed and Live Goods. The Southern division also posted positive comps in indoor garden led by strong performances in patio and portable outdoor power.  Our success in patio is a result of great design and price point combinations in our Martha Stewart line, as well as effective interconnected retail. In addition to purchasing in-stock patio sets in our stores, customers are taking advantage of our expanded assortment online and free shipping for orders over $249.  Based on independent third party tracking of consumer activity, we gained unit share in 9 out of 13 departments during the first quarter, including Lumber, Building Materials, flooring, paint, plumbing, electrical, Millwork, outdoor garden and kitchens. From a commodity standpoint, we lapped significant commodity inflation in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Recall that commodity inflation positively impacted U.S. comp sales by approximately 100 basis points in the first quarter of 2010.  The impact to U.S. comp sales from lumber in the first quarter of 2011 was a negative 24 basis points. This was offset by inflation in copper during the quarter so the net impact of our first quarter U.S. comp from commodity pricing was flat. When weather delays the start of the spring selling season like we've seen in the north this year, we typically experience larger spike sales. In preparations for these spikes, we chose to keep our stores fully stocked with seasonal inventory, a decision that had a negative impact on inventory turns year-over-year. As we look to the second quarter, we expect to sell through the seasonal product profitably as spring breaks in the remainder of the U.S.  Looking ahead, we continue to believe that transaction improvements will lead to growth in the first half of the year and improvement in average ticket will be more sustaining in the back half of the year. We're well-positioned to drive sales in the second quarter. And as the consumer faces headwinds from increased fuel, food and clothing prices, we are sharpening our focus on value and targeting key products every household uses.  Innovation also plays a big role for us in driving sales. As spring finally reaches the entire country, we are happy to offer new lithium-ion power tools for the yard from Ryobi, including the cordless string trimmer and hedge trimmer that take advantage of the new Ryobi One+ 24-volt platform, providing more powerful performance.  We are also excited about Allure Ultra vinyl flooring, exclusive to The Home Depot. This is easy to install click-lock flooring that is waterproof and includes a lifetime residential and 10-year commercial warranties.  Finally, in the first quarter, we introduced ArmorGuard decking and we've seen great results in the southeast. ArmorGuard offers an easy to clean, mold and mildew resistant surface with a 20-year stain and fade warranty not available with traditional composite decks.  We're expecting this product to take off in the second quarter as more of our customers look to upgrade their outdoor spaces. We're seeing a strong start to May and we're excited about the products we have to offer our customers in the coming months.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $16.8 billion, down 0.2% from last year. Comps for same-store sales were negative 0.6% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.6% in February, positive 1.1% in March and negative 3.9% in April.  Comps for U.S. stores were negative 0.7% for the quarter with U.S. comps of positive 2.8% in February, positive 1.2% in March and negative 4% in April. As we've discussed, April same-store sales were negatively impacted by tough year-over-year comparisons and unseasonably cold weather. We've seen a return to positive comps in May in line with our expectations.  In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.6%, an increase of 28 basis points from last year, of which 24 basis points was driven by our U.S. business and 4 basis points was driven by our Canadian business. In the U.S., our gross margin expansion was attributable to the following factors: first, 14 basis points of gross margin expansion, was due to a lower penetration of lower margin seasonal categories namely garden and lumber; second, 5 basis points of our gross margin expansion was due to fewer deferred financing programs; and finally, the remaining 5 basis points of margin expansion reflects benefits arising from our portfolio strategy and our supply chain transformation. Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 43 basis points to 26.2%. While we have some expense pressure in certain areas, total operating expenses were $83 million less than last year in 4 main expense categories: payroll, management bonus, advertising and depreciation.  A year-over-year reduction in payroll and bonus expense was principally a reflection of the sales environment this year versus last year. Lower advertising expense this year reflects our decision to push more advertising spend into the second quarter of 2011 to align our advertising spending with our top-selling months.  Finally, lower depreciation expense was a function of a change in penetration of our fixed asset classes. Based on our first quarter results, we now expect expenses to grow at approximately 60% of our sales growth rate for the year. Interest and other expense for the first quarter totaled $139 million, flat to last year when you adjust for the charge we took last year related to the revaluation of our HD Supply loan guarantee.  Our income tax provision rate was 36.7% in the first quarter. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 37%. Earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.50, up 16.3% from last year. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 11.1% compared to last year's adjusted earnings per share of $0.45.  Moving to our operational metrics. During the first quarter, we opened 2 new stores and, as previously announced, closed 5 stores for an ending store count of 2,245.  At the end of the first quarter, selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $287, down 0.3% year-over-year.  Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $11.7 billion, up $215 million from last year. Inventory turns were 3.9x, down slightly from 4.1x a year ago.  For fiscal 2011, we anticipate a small improvement in inventory turnover. We ended the quarter with $42.8 billion in assets, including $1.8 billion in cash. This is an increase of approximately $1.3 billion in cash from the end of fiscal 2010. During the first quarter, we issued $2 billion of senior notes. We used the proceeds to refinance $1 billion of debt that came due in March and to repurchase $1 billion of outstanding shares through an accelerated share repurchase program. Including open market purchases, we repurchased a total of $1.3 billion or 29.4 million shares of outstanding stock in the first quarter.  This share count is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program in the second quarter.  We ended the quarter with approximately $10.7 billion of outstanding long-term debt, of which the earliest maturity is $1.3 billion coming due in December 2013. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt in equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 13%, 150 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2010.  As Frank and Craig mentioned, we fell a bit short of our internal sales plan in the first quarter, due primarily to weather. Sales were also reflective of U.S. GDP growth, which, for the quarter, came in under FOMC estimates. As we look to the balance of the year, we continue to believe our sales growth will be closely correlated to U.S. GDP growth. 2011 U.S. GDP growth expectations were recently reduced to approximately 3%, but it was only a slight modification.  As a result, we still project that we will grow our sales by approximately 2.5% this year. Now if GDP growth expectations were to slow down considerably, we would need to rework this projection. From an earnings per share perspective, remember that we guide off of GAAP. Based on our first quarter results, and including a $0.02 benefit from the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, we now project fiscal 2011 earnings per share from continuing operations to increase approximately 11.4% to $2.24.  In our earnings per share guidance, we are not including the impact of any additional share repurchases outside of those executed in the first quarter. But it is our intent to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2011. So we thank you for your participation in today's call.  And Yvonne, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: Can you just talk a little bit about the impact of mix on margins in the quarter?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Absolutely, Deb. As we talked about, we did have 28 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter, 24 of which came from the U.S. Now 14 of that was all mix related. We had a lower penetration of lower margin categories like garden and lumber, and that drove 14 basis points of margin expansion. We also had 4 basis points of margin expansion coming out of Canada. That was all mix related as well.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And then, Frank, in your comments, you had talked about your First for Pro program. Can you talk about exactly where you are with that? And what do you think have been the biggest drivers of the improvement in the Pro satisfaction scores?\nCraig Menear: Sure. Thanks, Deb. And Marvin Ellison, who's our head of U.S. stores, is here, so I'd ask Marvin to address that.\nMarvin Ellison: Deb, it's really a couple of things. In serving our Pro customers, time is money and that's a very simple statement. So we look at getting them in and out fast. We have dedicated loaders, dedicated cashiers, we use our First Phone for a mobile point-of-sale, which allows us to check them out a lot faster. And really, the positive result is just about getting them in the store and out of the store faster and providing a level of service with the associates being in the aisle, in front, engaging them and allowing them to get their questions answered and their services met in a lot faster manner.\nDeborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: Great. And then last question. You talked about a strong start to May. Has that been geographically broad-based as well as from a category perspective?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, it has.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: First question, just obviously the weather didn't cooperate and, I think, rightly, you kept inventory levels where you wanted. Hopefully, weather's getting better, but if it doesn't through 2Q, is there any way you can quantify what the gross margin pressure might be from a little bit of accelerated markdowns on seasonal goods?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: As we've looked at the forecast for the second quarter as well as the balance of the year, we've run a number of different scenarios. And we feel good about our inventory and our ability to drive the margin expansion that's in the full year guidance. As you'll recall, at the beginning of the year, we said we would have modest gross margin expansion. As we look at where we stand, a number of different scenarios, we still believe that guidance will hold.\nFrancis Blake: And Colin, we use our merchandising tools and forecasting capabilities that we put in place to actually look at this on a week-by-week basis. And we look to make any appropriate adjustments if we don't see the type of sell-through that we're looking for. So always looking to optimize sales in the process.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Craig, just a quick follow-up for you. You said in light of gas, food, apparel, inflation, that you are, I think, \"sharpening focus on value.\" Can you talk about any of the product categories or any of the moves you're making there on that value message?\nCraig Menear: Well, we have sharpened our pencil as it relates to outdoor products that the customer uses most in their garden. We're also looking at things in the maintenance and repair area where customers are under pressure because of the things that you mentioned where we know they absolutely need to make repairs and we want to help them through that process.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Okay, fair enough.\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Colin.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I want to focus my question on gross margin as well. To the extent that you're looking for some expansion here and that mix was the biggest contributor to gross margin growth in Q1, if you could talk broadly speaking about the drivers of gross margin, does mix continue to work your way at the supply chain and logistics kind of pick up? And also in that thought process, what's your thinking on the promotional environment as you saw it in Q1 and how that factors into your gross margin thinking?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, I'll start with the gross margin comments. I want to talk a minute about supply chain and the benefits that we're seeing from supply chain. As we all know, we faced fuel pressures in the first quarter. It was about a $23 million headwind. We covered that headwind through the great efforts of our supply chain team and the productivity that we're seeing off of the RDC. So the 5 basis points of margin expansion that we attributed to a portfolio strategy and supply chain was really all supply chain covering that headwind. So as we look at the balance of the year, we see good benefits coming off the supply chain, as we anticipated. And as you know, longer term, Matt, we are anticipating getting 40 basis points off of our RDC network.\nCraig Menear: Yes. And as it relates -- Matt, this is Craig. As it relates to, really, how we're going to market, compared to what's happening in the marketplace, we're continuing to focus on really being the customer's advocate for value and trying to drive everyday great value for our customers. We believe that, that's what they're looking for. And we're using our portfolio strategy to drive the business. And there's been varying different promotional activities in the marketplace, but we're sticking to our strategy. We believe it's working for us.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And I think we could say that we view any blanket discount with caution.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Got it. And then by way of follow-up, your average ticket remains relatively robust against, obviously, the appliance stimulus a year ago. I'm not sure how much of that has to do with maybe seasonal taking a backseat to some bigger ticket categories in the quarter. But if you could talk about the broader status of big ticket transactions and customers' comfort in that arena, that would be great.\nFrancis Blake: Yes. So Matt, on transactions less than $50, we were down about 2.2% in the quarter. Certainly, that has a -- the big impact there is in fact the seasonal businesses, which drive a lot of lower ticket products. Likewise, on tickets greater than $900, we were down 2.6% and there's certainly a mix impact to the growth in the average ticket as a result of the lower transactions.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And to the extent that you were down 2.5% in the $900 and over, is that OPE-driven? Or are there other categories that are under pressure?\nFrancis Blake: Certainly, OPE was not a great first quarter and that had an impact. It's a continued impact to large discretionary-type spends. The one call out exception to that is what I mentioned in my comments in that we did have a terrific performance in our Kitchen business with the great offerings that we have out there. But we're still seeing those bigger ticket discretionary projects under pressure with the customer.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And if I might add a little more color, Matt, to that, remember $900 doesn't necessarily mean an item. It can also include items in a basket, and as Craig commented, we're not seeing our Pro comeback fully yet. And so that's impacting that business as well.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Horvers with JP Morgan.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I wanted to ask first about the follow-up on the ticket expansion that you were just talking about. It's interesting. Clearly, you're driving some great values and some great promotions in kitchen cabinets. But I assume that you've been trying that for the past 5 years. So what has really changed here? And do you think that the consumer's stepping up? We started with some paint, now we're going after some promotional cabinets. Are we building the ticket basket? Do you feel like as if we're making progress on that side?\nFrancis Blake: Chris, I think it's a combination of a lot of work that's been happening over a few years. We have been working to be able to put programs in place that will allow a customer to upgrade their kitchen no matter how they want to do that, whether that is simply refacing or refreshing their kitchen. We have options for the customer in those categories. If they want to go in and start that project tonight with assembled cabinets, we have worked to improve our offering there over the past couple years, and likewise, if you want to tear your kitchen out and start over, we've got great value propositions, including our new Martha lineup of kitchens that has been extremely well received by our customer.\nMarvin Ellison: Chris, this is Marvin. In addition to that, we focused a lot on training the last couple years, on project training and on specific values that we offered to the customers for our associates. In the past, we didn't do a great job of educating our associates on the value that we offer on our products in stores, as well as the selling process. And we spent a lot of time with our Customer First program in going to each associate in each department specifically in these -- the core areas and really spending time on deliberate steps to how you satisfy a customer and how you engage a customers' buying. Those types of projects.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So then can you talk about then how did the inside of the store do? The non -- not patio, not excluding the outdoor, could you isolate what the comp was performance in the nonseasonal categories?\nFrancis Blake: In terms of the categories that did well, and you look at the businesses that actually performed with positive growth, flooring, paint, tools, plumbing, electrical, all of those categories, the core center of the store actually had a very solid performance in the quarter overall. And in contrast to exterior projects, which were pretty difficult, obviously, there wasn't much happening outdoors. So real strength in the core of the center of the store.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And then one quick follow-up on the previous question about gross margin. As you think about Lowe's 5% off new rewards program, how do you view that? How do you view your response? And how was the performance of your 10% off everyday items program?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, we view blanket discounting with caution. We do use credit as a selling tool, as you know. Our everyday value proposition is if you spend $299 on our private label card, it's 6 months no interest minimum payment. Last year, we offered a everyday savings program, as you recall, which was if you used our private label card and you bought everyday items like light bulbs, trash bags, batteries, those sort of items, you would get 10% off. Initially, we liked what we saw and it was a tender shift play. So we saw a nice tender shift from bankcards onto our private label card, which, as you know, carries a lower cost. But then it just petered out. And what we found is that the customers weren't responding the program and so the tender shift that we saw was only about a point and a half. Not very exciting to us. So we determined that, that's not the value proposition the customer's looking for and we will be winding that program down.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer & Co.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: First, quick question and I know we spent a lot of time talking about the weather, the impact of the weather in Q1. But just so we're clear, I want to see maybe how you were thinking about this. So sales were impacted by adverse weather over the last maybe late in the quarter, you said things have gotten better here in May. But how should we think about going forward from here? Is it just a matter of timing? So if the weather improves, those sales essentially get made up. Or do we reach a point where maybe some of those sales evaporate? How should we think about this as we progress through Q2 and maybe through the next few months?\nFrancis Blake: Brian, it's a good point. There is a point where you do start losing some sales, and, Craig, you might want to comment on that.\nCraig Menear: Sure. So what we've done is we've actually gone in and looked at multiple year history by category. Certainly, at this point, there is a little bit of business we felt in pre-emergence and in live goods that we probably won't recapture. But when you look at the majority of the seasonal business, it's running along that multi-year average. So we really don't have a significant concern. I think if something were really unusual to happen and weather continued to be horrible through the month of May, you get to Memorial Day, we'd have to deal with it in a little different manner, but I don't see that happening.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Okay, very helpful. And then, Frank, a question for you. We've spent a lot of time over the last few quarters taking about how you look at your business and some of the, sort of the drivers there and how you've seen this, sort of say, break from some of the traditional housing metrics, more just a general consumer confidence. So obviously, a lot of noise in the quarter with the weather, but as you looked at the business progress over the last few months, and we've seen continued weakness in some traditional housing measures, have you seen that relationship continue to break down here?\nFrancis Blake: Yes. I'd say this quarter sort of underscores it, Brian, because as I called out, we had some strength in markets that are still pretty tough on the housing side. And so it was much more -- if you look at our southern and western divisions positively comping and actually those areas having some of the most problematic housing issues, you really get -- we're more GBP dependent, and obviously, in the spring, we're weather dependent. And that's really how, as Carol called out, that's how we're looking at the remainder of the year.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Got it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Strasser with Janney Montgomery Scott.\nDavid Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Kind of looking on the Internet and where you're spending a lot of money continuing to build out e-commerce, I mean, I guess, one of the issues that I keep hearing about is pricing transparency. And can you talk a little bit about what you're trying to do to help -- to combat that or to -- particularly like with mat pricing and what's going on from a power tools standpoint? I'm just trying to understand some of the opportunities there or some of the challenges.\nFrancis Blake: Yes. I mean, certainly, you're right, David. The information to the consumer is more readily available than it ever has been before. We're certainly monitoring the activity to look at what's going on in the marketplace to make sure that we're competitive on a day-in, day-out position and reacting accordingly. There's certain -- there's opportunity to look at driving products that are exclusive to you. We work hard on differentiation, and differentiation applies to the big box as well as it does to the online space.\nDavid Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: And as far as mat pricing, is that something that's becoming more aggressively enforced or not as online matures?\nCraig Menear: I don't know that I'd say that I've seen any major change in that at this point in time.\nDavid Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay. And actually, can I just change the topic one second? Looking at -- just trying to understand with D&A going down in dollars, just trying to get a sense, Carol, probably best how should we thinking about that going forward? I mean, is it more the lack of store growth? Is it less IT spending, just from a modeling standpoint to think about it a little bit more?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. It's really related to the store growth. We just got fully depreciated assets falling off of our asset register. So if you think about where we're spending our dollars, we're spending our dollars in IT. We're spending our dollars maintaining. Most of that is expense, not capital. And in terms of new store growth, which is the biggest piece of our capital -- asset base, if you will, that's very, very slow.\nDavid Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: I mean, so going forward, does that number...\nCarol Tom\u00e9: The number continues to decline going forward.\nDavid Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: At a greater rate?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: No, at about the same rate.\nDavid Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay, all right.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser - Lehman Brothers: You've clearly been a share leader as the home improvement market recovers. Have you been able to look back and directly tie some of the customer service initiatives to the performance? So perhaps you've been able to look at the Net Promoter Score by store and then correlate that to the performance of the score to get a sense for what you've been doing has really had impact.\nFrancis Blake: Michael, we can't -- it's pretty tough to tie Net Promoter Score to particular stores and as we've been reporting over the last several quarters, we've seen improvement in that. You'd like to think that, that ties to our overall performance. But it's -- we've actually had improvements in Net Promoter Scores even in difficult quarters. So this is a long-term, I mean, I think it's a long-term sustaining improvement that we're trying to achieve, and I wouldn't to try to tie it to a quarter's results.\nMarvin Ellison: Mark, this is Marvin. The only thing I'll add to that is Craig and I talk a lot about merchandising value. The service in the stores will drive transactions. And so we try to create that sustaining model in the stores. Frank is right; it's not a quick fix and it's not something that you can directly correlate. But there's not a huge variance between our stores from a service score standpoint. They're pretty tightly correlated, which means that we try to have service standard consistent in all markets in all stores. And we think if we can sustain that, then what we'll see will be continued improvement in our transactions. But as mentioned, we're very weather-dependent this time of the year and even with great service and value, you're going to have a drag on transactions when Mother Nature's not cooperating. But that's our philosophy: Value on the merchant side, service in the store. And we think, consistently, that's going to lead us to a positive transaction, which also will drive sales.\nMichael Lasser - Lehman Brothers: Understood. That's really helpful. A quick follow-up question. Last year, you rolled out a checkbook tool to the stores and you saw a nice benefit from a tighter expense control. How far along do you think you're in that process? Are you reaching the end of the benefit?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, Michael, as we mentioned, we were $83 million under last year. We were also under our plan. So we continue to derive benefits from the new checkbook tool and other tools that we've introduced to manage our expenses.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I guess, my question, first question goes -- you increased the earnings per share guidance to $2.24 from I think it was $2.20, and $0.02 of that's for the share repurchase program. The other $0.02, Carol, is that for what's going to happen in the third -- second, third and fourth quarter? Or for your overperformance in the first quarter?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: That was based on our overperformance in the first quarter relative to our plan.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And you said that you were underspent or under your plan in spending and you said that you're going to push increased advertising into the second quarter or second half, I can't remember which. Can you kind of quantify for us what that might be?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure. We were underspent relative to last year, our advertising dollars was $14 million. And as a percent of our total spend, it reflects 25% of our spend in the first quarter as compared to last year where we had 27% of our advertising spend in the first quarter. So we were pushing it into the second quarter because we think that makes more sense to align our advertising spend with our top selling months. So if you think about expense management for our company, at the beginning of the year, we said that expenses would grow at 70% of our sales growth rate. We were under our expenses in the first quarter relative to plan because some expenses didn't materialize the way we thought they would, particularly payroll tax. I'm giving you more color than you probably want. But anyway, because we were under our expense plan in the first quarter, as we reforecast the balance of the year, we now think expenses will grow at about 60% of our sales growth rate.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's very, very helpful. And finally, if I could, just -- you talked about kitchens doing well. Can you talk a little bit more granularly about appliances and how that performed? And what your outlook is for that merchandise classification, Craig?\nCraig Menear: So appliances was a more difficult compare in the first quarter. We were down approximately 6.6%, had about a 20 basis point impact on the comp in the quarter. The industry rate now, the best information we can gather is projecting about a 1%-ish for the year. So the industry is projecting for things to improve.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And your thoughts about that?\nCraig Menear: We believe it will head in that direction.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Daniel Binder with Jefferies & Company.\nDaniel Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: It's Dan Binder. I know you mentioned that commodity inflation really didn't have an impact on the quarter. I was curious whether or not some of that ticket lift that you're getting is a function of some inflation across areas that you don't necessarily measure directly or tie to commodity inflation but to other vendor price increases. And whether that is a reasonable expectation over the course of the year to look for a 1% to 2% type of inflation benefit.\nFrancis Blake: I think the ticket is -- it's a combination of a number of factors. It is a combination of the fact that the outdoor categories, particularly outdoor garden, was soft, which is a lower ticket, which helped drive the ticket in the quarter. It's a combination of the fact that we did well in our Cabinet business overall. It's also a factor of we've really been focusing on improving the value proposition across all of our line segments. So categories like our soft-sided tool storage, our paint program, we're doing well in products that are in the upper middle to upper end of our line structure and that's certainly having a benefit as well. And certainly, we had a benefit from the rise in copper.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: But here's just a data point, I think this might be helpful. If you look at our ticket growth, which is about $0.81 in the quarter, $0.32 of that was in our kitchens. And that wasn't inflation at all.\nDaniel Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. The other question was on special order. You mentioned that you're 20% of the way to digitizing content. I'm just kind of curious how long it takes you to get most of the way on that.\nFrancis Blake: It shouldn't take us a very long. We will easily have that done by the end of the year, if not sooner.\nDaniel Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay, great. And then finally, on the customer service side, obviously, the experience in the aisles has been notably better. It seems to be showing up in your customer service scores. I'm curious, though, if you dissect the customer service and look at the front end exclusively where there still seems to be a heavy weighting of self check out, do you sense that customers are looking for a shift to more one-on-one checkout? And if there's room to improve that experience?\nMarvin Ellison: Dan, this is Marvin. When we look at the quarter, our greatest improvement in service is in our front end scores. We put a big emphasis on this in the fourth quarter of last year knowing that as we approach spring this year, we wanted to have a faster, more friendly, more efficient checkout process for our customers. We renewed the training, we created an enhanced focus and we've been very pleased with what we've seen so far. And it's a priority for us for the balance of the year. It's something that, honestly, we have not historically done very well from a checkout perspective. We rolled out a new system that allows us to have any cashier to ring on any register so when we have backups, we don't have the process of getting a till out of the back office and setting up a register. We can allow any person to ring and that has sped up the ability to get customers out faster. And our Pro customers, as I mentioned earlier, are very pleased with checkout. The last point that I'll give you is our First Phones that we've talked about in the past, we do approximately 100,000 transactions per week at checkout with those mobile devices. That has been a tremendous benefit in speeding up checkout and customers love being in line and somebody to just walk up and ring them up right there and they can go out the door. So big focus and we're going to continue to put a big emphasis on it this year.\nDaniel Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Great. That's good to hear as a customer, too.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: On expenses, the reduction of the full year target, can you give a little bit more color? And I guess specifically, I'm interested in how you're managing or thinking about your investment in labor related to what you're doing with total expense spending.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Right. Well, as you know, Eric, we've got an activity-based labor model and so we staff our stores relative to the sales that are inside the stores and nothing's changed in that regard. And of course, Marvin and his team are driving towards 60%-40% where 60% of the hours will be focused on selling, 40% on tasking. In terms of our new guidance, it's really reflected on some of the discrete cost pressures that we thought we would have in 2011 that don't appear to be as material. One of those, in fact, is payroll taxes, and I think we've discussed that with you. Many states said they were going to increase their payroll tax rates. These were states where we have a lot of people. That didn't happen in the first quarter. We're not sure it's going to happen in the second quarter. So that's just a function of our reviewed look on expenses. And then we tightened up our belt in a few other areas and things -- in areas that we can control. And so we feel real good about this guidance that we've given.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: Great. And then secondly, in terms of inventories, can you just review our restate and talk a little bit about where you expect to be at year end in terms of inventory performance?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. We expect inventory turnover to show a slight improvement from fiscal 2010. Inventory turns for 2010 was 4.1x. So we should be higher than that. Maybe another way to think about it is just, where's working capital going? Working capital will be a source of cash for the company in 2011. We are projecting that working capital, as a percent of sales, will drop from 10.3% in 2010 to 9.8% in 2011.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: So I think working capital came out of 1Q up previously versus year ago. How does that -- what specifically happens over the next 9 months or next 3 quarters to make that shift?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We've got to sell through the seasonal inventory. So if you look at our payables inventory ratio, you can see a pretty marked decline year-over-year. And it's simply related to our seasonal category. We have 6 selling departments that show improvement in inventory in the quarter. But in our seasonal categories, most of that product, not the live goods obviously, but patio and grills, those sorts of products, they're imported. We pay for those when they're shipped. You'll recall that we brought them in early in anticipation of what we had hoped would be a strong spring selling season. Well, we sold it in the south and the west. We didn't sell it in the north. We're going to sell it in the north, and our working capital will get righted in the second quarter.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: Okay, that's helpful.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid S. MacGregor: Craig, just with respect, you talked about the impact of inflation. And I'm just wondering as vendors pushing you on pricing at this point, what was the impact of the timing on the past here on gross margins?\nCraig Menear: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.\nDavid S. MacGregor: You've talk about the fact that vendors were pushing you on pricing. I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of we've talked already about inflation was relatively flat in the quarter. But what was the impact on margins of the timing of that pass-through? Were you were able to pass through the price increases immediately? Or is there some push forward in margins into second quarter?\nCraig Menear: Yes. There was really no impact on a margin basis at all from inflation.\nDavid S. MacGregor: Okay. The second question, just online sales trends in April, and are we able to isolate weather impact by comparing online sales with in-store sales?\nFrancis Blake: That's an interesting question, David. And actually, what you'd see, which isn't a huge surprise, is even though people may be indoors ordering online, if the weather is horrible outdoors, they're still not ordering a patio set. So interestingly, I mean, when you could have had a theory that said, \"online would be sustaining even in bad weather,\" it really doesn't happen so much.\nFrancis Blake: Okay, great.\nOperator: We will take our last question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.\nPeter Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Just a couple follow-ups, a lot of them have already been asked. But just, Carol, on the D&A, you said it's expected to continue to decline this year. Will that hold next year? You think D&A in '12 will be less than '11?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, it will be.\nPeter Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about the promotional tone in the Outdoor Power Equipment business? Particularly kind of the riding mowers and has that kind of -- it's become a little bit elevated here versus your expectations? And then your indoor/outdoor mix, how does that flex kind of by quarter across the year?\nCraig Menear: So I would say that there's been a fair amount of promotional activity in the -- particularly in the Rider business. It's a shorter season. So people are trying to make sure that they don't miss that season, expected that to be a competitive environment. As it relates to the outdoor penetrations, we are roughly 30% outdoor project-type business in the first quarter. That is kind of close to historical numbers. It grows to about 35% in Q2.\nPeter Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you, everyone, today for joining us. And we look forward to talking to you at next quarter's earnings release call.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference.

Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $18.2 billion, up 13.9% from last year. Comp sales were positive 7% and our diluted earnings per share were $0.68. Our stores in the United States had a positive comp of 7.1%. Even though we were anniversarying strong sales from last year\u2019s warm weather and storm repair, all three of our U.S. divisions positively comped in the quarter, and 38 of our top 40 markets had positive comps. New York and New Jersey were our best-performing regions, driven principally by Hurricane Sandy related repair activity. And we continue to see recovery in our Florida, California, and Arizona markets. On the international front, our Canadian business had positive comps for the fifth consecutive quarter, and our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps, making it 37 quarters in a row of positive comp growth. During the quarter, we also opened our 100th store in Mexico, a significant milestone in the growth of our business there. In the U.S., our results benefited from storm repair, but they also reflected an improving housing market. During the housing market downturn and even during the stabilization of the last few quarters, our pro sales performance lagged our consumer sales growth. An encouraging sign in the fourth quarter was that sales to our pro customers grew on particular with sales to consumers. We\u2019re also beginning to see growth within our smaller pro segment. Previously, the growth in our pro business occurred predominantly within the larger pro segment. We had a hypothesis that the growth would start to reach our smaller volume pros as the market recovered, and our fourth quarter results provide at least one data point to suggest that is occurring. Our services business is also recovering. In the quarter we saw double digit growth in this business, with strength across our key programs. We have now had nine consecutive quarters of growth in services, and we are adding technology with our \u201cMy Install\u201d functionality, which provides customers more real time updates and project tracking throughout the installation process. Operationally, Marvin and his team continue to make progress on our customer service initiatives. We have a target of 60-40, where 60% of our store labor hours are dedicated to customer-facing activity. We ended the year at 57%. Our customer satisfaction scores improved again during the quarter, as well as for the year, at the same time that we had the highest annual transactions in the company history. During the quarter, we began the rollout of buy online, ship to store. We already have in place buy online, pick up in store, and buy online, return in store. These are foundational components of our interconnected retail experience. As a team, we\u2019ve been focused on making sure that this is not only a convenient offering for our customers, but also a great experience, and we\u2019re pleased to see our customer satisfaction scores for these services continuing to improve. As you\u2019ll hear from Craig, we saw strength in the core of our business in the quarter, and our holiday assortment and expanded appliance offerings also performed well. We had what was for us a record sell through of our holiday items, and our dotcom business had a strong holiday selling season in the quarter, with record sales online. We also completed the acquisition of BlackLocus, a retail analytics firm, which will bring additional tools and capabilities to support our merchandising team.  We are pleased that in 2012, we met and beat the targets we set in 2009 of achieving an operating margin of 10% and a return on invested capital of 15%. We ended 2012 with a 10.4% operating margin and a 17% return on invested capital. This past June, at our investor conference, we set out our next stage financial targets of 12% operating margin and 24% return on invested capital by 2015. For fiscal year 2013, as Carol will detail, we expect comp sales growth of low single digits, and we expect diluted earnings per share including share repurchases from excess cash of $3.37, or an increase of 12%. While we believe a recovery in housing is underway, GDP growth is expected to be modest, and there are a number of pressures on our customers, including reduced disposable income and continued constraints on credit availability.  Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP saw another uptick to 2.6% in the fourth quarter, but is still well below previous historic lows. We continue to believe that the path to recovery will resemble a gradual thawing process. We think it is best to plan and structure our business on the assumption of a modest recovery and then adjust, if and when the opportunities or challenges arise as we have previously. Today, our board announced a 34% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.39 per share. The board has also authorized a new share repurchase program of $17 billion. We are committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy, investing in our business and with our excess cash, creating value for shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication in the fourth quarter and throughout 2012. Over 99% of our stores qualified for success sharing, our bonus program for our hourly associates, for the second half of the year, and we had the highest-ever success sharing payout. We look forward to continuing this momentum in 2013. And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig. \nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning everyone. We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, as sales exceeded our expectations across the country and across all departments. But I would also like to take a moment and recognize the cross-functional efforts of our stores, our merchants, supply chain, and our vendors for meeting the needs of the communities impacted by Hurricane Sandy. They did a great job of working to take care of our customers. The departments that outperformed the company\u2019s average comp for the fourth quarter were tools, lumber, electrical, outdoor garden, lighting, indoor garden, and d\u00e9cor. Flooring, kitchens, bath, plumbing, hardware, paint, and millwork performed positively, and while comp sales in building materials were negative, they exceeded our plan. As Sandy hit in the beginning of the fourth quarter and damaged the shorelines in New Jersey and New York, we saw a sales lift, which Carol will go over in her remarks. Specific categories in the northern division that were first to experience lift after the storm were generators, with a triple digit comp, as well as double digit performance in plywood, safety and security, extension cords, water heaters, and cleaning. These sales can be attributed to the immediate needs of our customers to get their homes back in order. We expect the impact of Sandy to continue at least through the first half of the year. While winter was warmer than average, it wasn\u2019t as warm as 2011, which led to negative performance in exterior project categories in the northern division. However, we saw positive performance in the north, in projects completed inside the home, like laminate flooring, wood flooring, and interior paints. Across all U.S. divisions, the core of the store continues to maintain momentum, with positive performance in plumbing, hardware, and paint departments, as well as maintenance and repair categories in spray paint, lubricants, light bulbs, chemicals, pipe and fittings, tape, plumbing repair, and fasteners. As I shared with you last quarter, we had several programs planned to drive sales in the fourth quarter. In decorative holiday, we had double digit positive comps in every region of the company, and we are becoming the destination for these products. We also had strong sales on Black Friday that drove record performance, and our gift center sales exceeded our plan and resulted in positive performance in hand tools, portable power, and power tool accessories. Total comp transactions grew by 1.7% for the quarter, while average ticket increased 5.6%. Our average ticket increase was impacted somewhat by commodity price inflation in lumber and copper, which contributed approximately 80 basis points to comp. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 0.3% for the fourth quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 9% in the fourth quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were the strength in generators and appliances.  Now let me turn our attention to the first quarter. We always talk about how spring is our biggest selling season, and so for the fourth consecutive year, we will have our spring Black Friday event. We continue to work with our vendors to bring in special buys and extraordinary value on popular spring items. In addition to this kickoff for our spring season, we\u2019re excited about the new products our merchants have added to our assortments. In outdoor living, we are introducing 10 new patio collections this quarter, in store, and online we are introducing 14 new collections from Hampton Bay and Martha Stewart Living. And later in the quarter, we will be adding 11 new patio families to our Home Decorator collection online.  We\u2019ve focused on building out our collections this year, and expanded our selection of coordinating pieces online. These expanded sets will offer our customers an incredible selection at great values, and allow them to create the outdoor living experience they desire. To enhance our patio collections, we are introducing a semi-customizable cushion program via online that allows customers to choose their own cushion color from 10 different options. In addition, we have a great new lineup of grills, with exclusive offerings from Brinkman, Charbroil, and Weber. New for 2013 in garden, [Andro\u2019s] complete weed and pest control system has quick change out cartridges with four refill options for multiple weed and pest control apps. This system eliminates measuring, mixing, application, and storage issues associated with traditional chemical applications. For lawn maintenance, we have new zero turn tractors from Cub Cadet and Toro, and expansion in our lithium battery powered products in cordless outdoor power tools, including a pole saw and mower, in addition to new trimmers and edgers.  We are ready for spring, but we have a strong line of products for projects inside the home as well. In store now, we have our SoftSpring carpet, some of the softest, most durable carpet on the market, to which customers are really responding.  In addition, during the quarter, we\u2019ll have new products available in LED lighting and new innovation in bulbs, and expansion of our recessed lighting offering. We will also have new innovation in our paint department and expansion of our Husky mechanics tools and pneumatics.  We continue to expand our faucet assortment, with over 20 items debuting in the quarter, including two exclusive Moen faucets that feature microband technology, which mitigates the adherence of germs and bacteria to the fixture.  Finally, we are enhancing our vanity lineup, with several new styles, specifically with the introduction of our first Glacier Bay all in one vanity.  And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol Tome: Thank you, Craig, and hello everyone. In the fourth quarter, sales were $18.2 billion, a 13.9% increase from last year. Our fiscal year included a 53rd week, which added approximately $1.2 billion in sales to the fourth quarter and the year. The extra week is not included in our comp or same-store sales calculation.  Comps were positive 7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 7.2% in November, 13.7% in December, and 1.2% in January. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.1% for the quarter, with positive comps of 7.6% in November, 13.9% in December, and 1% in January. As we expected, the deceleration from December to January was due to the following factors. First, January was our toughest compare, as we had a positive comp of 8.8% in 2011. And then second, in 2012, the Christmas holiday fell in fiscal January compared to fiscal December in 2011, which shifted an entire day of sales from a comp perspective. Sales related to Hurricane Sandy were approximately $242 million in the fourth quarter, $112 million higher than the storm sales we realized from Hurricane Irene in the same period last year. As Craig explained, we believe there will be continued tailwinds from storm-related sales into 2013. For the year, our sales increased 6.2% to $74.8 billion. Total company comp sales were positive 4.6%, and comps for U.S. stores were positive 4.9%. Our total company gross margin was 34.9% for the quarter, a decrease of 6 basis points from last year. Five basis points of the year over year decline occurred in our U.S. business, and are explained by the following. First, our shrink efforts continue to gain traction, and we realized 15 basis points of gross margin expansion as a result of better shrink performance than one year ago. Second, we experienced 16 basis points of gross margin contraction due primarily to a change in mix of products sold, including a higher penetration of lower margin products like lumber, appliances, and generators. And finally, we experienced 4 basis points of gross margin contraction due to higher transportation costs in our supply chain, as we expedited merchandise to areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. For the year, we experienced 10 basis points of gross margin expansion. In the quarter and for the year, we experienced strong expense leverage due to positive sales growth and solid expense control. As you will recall, during the third quarter, we had an impairment charge of $155 million that ran through operating expense associated with the closing of our big box stores in China.  Subsequently, we settled certain China real estate leases in a more favorable way than we estimated, which resulted in a favorable adjustment of $20 million in the fourth quarter. Including this adjustment, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 135 basis points to 25.3% in the fourth quarter. Our operating leverage in the fourth quarter is a bit distorted by the extra week. On a 13-week basis, we leveraged expenses by 107 basis points.  For fiscal 2012, operating expense as a percent of sales was 24.2%, a decrease of 82 basis points from last year. Excluding the impact of China, operating expense as a percent of sales was 24%, a decrease of 100 basis points from last year. In the fourth quarter, interest and other expense was $160 million, a slight increase from last year, and for the year, interest and other expense totaled $545 million. Our income tax provision rate was 35.8% in the fourth quarter, and 37.2% for the year. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.68. Our 53rd week contributed approximately $0.07 of diluted earnings per share in the quarter and the year. For the year, on a reported basis, diluted earnings per share were $3, reflecting the $0.10 diluted earnings per share impact of the charges associated with the China store closing. Adjusting for the China charges, diluted earnings per share for the year was $3.10, an increase of 25.5% from fiscal 2011. Moving to our operational metrics, during the fourth quarter we opened six new stores in Mexico, and as a company we ended the year with 2,256 stores. At the end of the year, selling square footage was 235 million, flat to last year.  Total sales per square foot for the fourth quarter were $295, up 8.9% from last year. For fiscal 2012, sales per square foot were $319, up 6.6% from fiscal 2011. Both the fourth quarter and year-end sales per square foot number include the 53rd week.  At the end of the year, inventory was $10.7 billion, up $385 million from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.5x, up from 4.3x last year. Moving on to our share repurchase program, in the fourth quarter we received 1.5 million shares related to the true up of an accelerated share repurchase we initiated in the third quarter. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $700 million, or 11 million of our outstanding shares, on the open market. For the year, we repurchased a total of $4 billion, or 74 million shares, of outstanding stock.  Computed on the average of beginning and ending long term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 17%, 210 basis points higher than fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We detailed our guidance in our press release, but I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. To start, a few housekeeping matters. First, remember that we guide off of GAAP. So fiscal 2013 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2012, which include sales and earnings associated with the 53rd week.  Second, when we report our quarterly results, our fiscal 2013 comps will be reported on a like-for-like basis. In other words, we\u2019ll compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2013 against weeks 2 through 53 in fiscal 2012.  So, with that, as we look to 2013, we are basing our sales growth assumptions primarily on GDP forecasts, which, for the United States, is approximately 2%. We are also projecting that the U.S. housing market, namely turnover and improving home prices, will contribute 100 basis points of comp growth in 2013. While recovering, we do not believe the housing market will fully recover in 2013. Some may say this is a conservative view. We would agree. But we would rather plan conservatively and as we showed in the fourth quarter, if sales are stronger than we expect, we can react quickly to the demand. For the year, we expect comp sales growth of approximately 3% and total sales growth of approximately 2%. With this guidance, on a two-year basis, our comp for years 2013 and 2012 would be about the same as what we reported for the combined 2012 and 2011 years. We are planning for positive same-store sales growth in every quarter.  For 2013, we are projecting moderate gross margin expansion. This expansion will come from ongoing efforts in our merchandising transformation, and in part from benefits associated with certain acquisitions made in 2012.  On the expense front, we are forecasting our expenses to be roughly flat year over year, and on a 52-week basis, expect expenses to grow approximately 40%, the rate of our sales growth. For the year, we project that our operating margin will grow by approximately 65 basis points, reaching about 11% by the end of the year, just 100 basis points shy of our 2015 target.  For fiscal 2013, we expect diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 12% to $3.37. This guidance includes our plan to repurchase $4.5 billion of outstanding shares during the year, using excess cash. Our capital spending plan for fiscal 2013 is $1.5 billion, a 14.3% increase over what we spent in 2012, reflecting investments in support of our key initiatives. For the year, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $7.2 billion. We will use our cash to invest in our business and to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Our commitment to shareholder returns has never been stronger. As Frank mentioned, in today\u2019s press release we announced a 34% increase in our quarterly dividend, which equates to an annual dividend of $1.56, in line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50%.  Additionally, our board just announced a new share repurchase authorization of $17 billion. As discussed, we plan on using $4.5 billion from excess cash to repurchase shares in 2013. We are also contemplating raising external financing for additional share repurchases. Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is 1.6x, and based on our target adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio of 2x, we have roughly $4 billion of financing capacity today.  In the face of a recovering housing market and attractive interest rates, we believe 2013 may be an opportune time to issue incremental debt capital to repurchase shares. This action would be earnings per share accretive to the guidance that we shared with you this morning, and we will certainly let you know when we do something here. So we thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. Operator, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator instructions.] We\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Lasser, UBS.\nMichael Lasser - UBS:  First, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing anything in the business today that would speak to the duration and sustainability of the recovery. Obviously you\u2019re seeing really good trends right now. The issue is, how long can it last? \nFrancis Blake : I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything directly that we can see that\u2019s going to tell us how long it lasts. What I would say is that so far, what we\u2019re seeing is consistent with, if not slightly better, than what we discussed with everyone back in our June investor conference, where we laid out here\u2019s how we see our market recovering, that there will be a workout stage for a couple of years, before we hit the strong recovery stage. And I\u2019d say what we\u2019ve seen so far is consistent with that, if not slightly positive.\nMichael Lasser - UBS : And would you suggest it\u2019s coming from credit conditions easing? Is that in part what\u2019s driving the improvement?\nFrancis Blake : The way we look at it, it\u2019s coming from a number of factors. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint just one. And we hopefully gave a helpful roadmap back in June, but there\u2019s additional household formation, there\u2019s additional housing price appreciation, existing housing turnover is improving. Then credit availability, I\u2019d actually say, is still a bit of a brake on the recovery. But we see a lot of positive signs there.\nCarol Tome : And maybe I\u2019ll just give you one data point to make this real. We have a directionally correct, but imperfect, model, I would say. But if we look at just housing turnover, and you look at the number of units that turned in 2012, about 400,000 units, you apply an average spend against those units of about $3,500, apply our market share against that, and then we triangulate what it means to our comps, and we think about 50 basis points of our comp growth came from housing turnover. As we look to forecast for 2013, we would expect to get, again, 50 basis points of comp coming from housing turnover.\nMichael Lasser - UBS : That\u2019s very helpful. I think your models are probably more directionally correct than our models, so that\u2019s useful. One quick follow up question on the 60-40 breakdown in service. Should we expect that once you reach your targeted goal, that the [keynote] is going to reflect some incremental investment in labor. The fear now would be, as your sales continue to recover like they have, you\u2019re going to have to put more hours in the store to meet that demand. \nFrancis Blake : The first thing I would say is our business model actually reflects adding hours as the sales increase, as it is. Marvin\u2019s here, and he\u2019ll comment on 60-40, but the second thing I\u2019d say within 60-40 is our intention is when we get there - and obviously we\u2019re very, very close - there\u2019s an enormous amount of effort that will then go into optimizing our productivity within each of those groups of customer-facing and tasking. But Marvin, perhaps you want to comment. \nMarvin Ellison: We started this in roughly 2009, and within that timeframe, we\u2019ve generated roughly 500 payroll hours that we\u2019ve shifted to the selling floor. And that is a reallocation of payroll, not an incremental add of payroll, which is very beneficial to our financial model. As Frank mentioned, we will have a continuous improvement process, and we\u2019ll hit this milestone before the end of 2013. We\u2019re going to continue to find ways to optimize productivity. We\u2019re going to find ways to get additional hours to the sales floor.  So we\u2019re not going to stop. We\u2019re just probably going to not talk about it as much. But we\u2019re going to continue to improve our processes. As Frank mentioned, we have an activity based model, so as sales increase, payroll will be generated. That\u2019s going to be on top of what we can create with our productivity efforts. So we\u2019re very proud of the hard work of the operations team, the men and women in our stores, but we see this as a continuous process. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: My first question relates to the sales forecast. You talk about the relationship between your business and GDP, and you think about the [unintelligible] comp that you just produced in a quarter where GDP wouldn\u2019t come close to explaining the increase. Are there any other reasons other than general conservatism to think about the sales forecast where it is? And do you feel like perhaps you\u2019re understanding some the intrinsic and more sustainable drivers of the business that you saw in Q4?\nCarol Tome : The first thing I would say is when we build our forecasts, we do not assume any benefit from commodity or currency. So we are neutral from that perspective. And as we look out for 2013, we do look at GDP as the underlying basis for growth. Then we look at housing metrics to determine what we think could happen to the home improvement market, and that\u2019s the basis for the guidance that we gave for 2013 of 3%. Now, I will say to you, look at our performance in the fourth quarter. We exceeded our expectations. We beat our plan by about 4.5%. We can easily explain 200 basis points of that. About 80 basis points, as Craig said, came from commodity inflation, about 70 basis points came from the impact of Hurricane Sandy, and then about 30 basis points came from appliances. The rest is strength across the core of the business. That could suggest that our view is conservative looking ahead, but we\u2019d rather be conservative and react than [unintelligible].\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Fair enough. And then the second question I just wanted to ask you, just to the appliance business, that pops up a couple of times in the discussion as a driver of ticket and as a driver of mix impact on margin. Could you talk about any particular efforts that you have, whether you feel like this is a market share gain by the Home Depot, or underlying strength in the appliance market?\nCraig Menear: We do believe that based on independent tracking we picked up a little share in the appliance business. As you know, we went out and we actually expanded our assortment breadth in this category and we took 120 stores that we completed in the quarter with an expanded offering on the selling floor. And we\u2019re actually very pleased with the results that we\u2019ve gotten from the additional brands that we\u2019ve added to our assortment, as well as those 120 stores. And as a matter of fact, in 2013 we\u2019ll look to add about another 120 stores to that expanded program in store.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Binder with Jefferies & Co.\nDan Binder - Jefferies & Company: I was wondering if you can speak to any promotion or price investment year on year, if there was anything in the gross margin that reflected that.\nFrancis Blake : Overall, our activity was comparable with what we had last year, and really the big drivers are what Carol called out in terms of the pressure we saw from mix, in part due to Hurricane Sandy with things like generators and plywood that run significantly below the company average.\nCarol Tome : We had double digit growth in lumber. We love those lumber sales, but they are low margin.\nDan Binder - Jefferies & Company : Any thoughts on early Q1 trends?\nCarol Tome : Yeah, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of our business thus far. February is our toughest compare, and we\u2019re quite pleased.\nDan Binder - Jefferies & Company : Just one last thing, I was in a store recently - I realize you do lots of tests, but this was a fairly interesting test where you brought flooring to the front of the store, and I was just curious if that\u2019s something that has greater promise based on the results you\u2019re seeing there.\nFrancis Blake : I know there\u2019s flooring product in our [swing] area in certain stores. We do different buys at times on product that can vary by location in the country. But there\u2019s no move right now in total to bring flooring forward.\nMarvin Ellison : I think this is consistent with the local store-based team working with the regional merchandising team in the field. Just take a look at market share. They\u2019re responding to market demand, feedback from customers, and what they see as opportunities to grow incremental sales. \nOperator: We\u2019ll hear next from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. \nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Carol, I guess just one question. If you could maybe talk a little bit about the pluses and minuses within the expense side of the business embedded within the 3% comp. And then maybe just talk about, on a [sensitivity] basis, if your forecast has proved to be consensus, and you\u2019re able to do, let\u2019s say, a 4% comp or a 5% comp, how would you expect expense leverage to unfold? \nCarol Tome : I think I\u2019ll answer the last part of your question first. And here\u2019s just a really nice, easy rule of thumb. For every 50 basis points of comp growth ahead of our guidance, that would equate to $0.05 of earnings per share. So then you can model it however you want to model it. But that\u2019s an easy way to model it. Now, coming to the expense guidance that we gave before 2013, I\u2019m going to give you a bit of a long-winded answer, but hopefully this will help with your modeling. If you look at the total expenses that we reported for 2012, we exceeded our typical rule of thumb, which is that expenses will grow at 40% of our sales growth rate. Even including China, expenses grew at 30% of our sales growth rate. So it was a terrific year from an expense perspective. A few reasons for that. One, at our investor conference back in June, we identified some cost-out opportunities in casualty reserves and other expense items that we actually enjoyed in 2012. So our cost-out teams were doing a great job of just continuing to optimize our productivity, and so we recognized some pull-forward benefit, if you will. We also, on a year over year basis, had some expenses in 2011 that didn\u2019t repeat in 2012. Those expenses would include natural disaster expense. We had about $40 million in 2011 that didn\u2019t repeat in 2012. We had a write off of [chem draw] you may recall, $35 million. That occurred in 2011, didn\u2019t occur in 2012. So there\u2019s some year over year comparisons. The way I\u2019d like you to think about 2013 is simply this. If you take our expense base of a little over $18 billion for 2012, back out the costs associated with China, which is $135 million, back out the expenses associated with the extra week, which we estimate to be $260 million, that gives you a new cost base of call it $17.7 billion. I want you then to add to that expenses associated with some of the acquisitions that we made. That\u2019s between $85 million and $100 million. And then growth. We are going to grow our expenses. Now, they\u2019ll grow slower than our sales growth, but they will grow. So when you add it back up, you walk back up to a cost base in a dollar perspective about the same as it was in 2012, and then the rate of growth is 40% of sales on a 52-week basis. Long-winded answer, I know, but hopefully that\u2019s helpful.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates : I think you just saved the analysts a lot of time. [laughter] \nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein. \nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein: Just looking at the pace of sales through the fourth quarter, can you help us with that December to January, a huge comp for December \u201814, and a [unintelligible] comp in January. How much was that day shift of Christmas, how much was the very strong seasonal trim a tree holiday sales? Was the hurricane benefit significantly greater in December as January? Just help us reconcile that very, very strong versus a little bit weak given the 300 basis point different in compare.\nCarol Tome : Well, I\u2019ll start by telling you that we planned to have a negative comp in January. So when we look at the positive comp performance, we were thrilled with the results. Candidly, I didn\u2019t go back and calculate the day movement from one month to another month. We were just so thrilled with the results. Now, from a holiday perspective, Craig, it was a terrific holiday.\nCraig Menear : Yeah, we had awesome performance in several areas in December that we went hard after, holiday d\u00e9cor being one of those. Our gift centers had strong double digit comp performance. The holiday was actually a double digit comp on a double digit comp from the year before. So it\u2019s a business that we\u2019re building, and it provided some real strength in December.\nFrancis Blake : And there were extras, like the extra time before Christmas. There were other factors that we think contributed to a very strong December. But as Carol said, we were very pleased with January, because as we were laying it out, we thought it would be negative.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein : And then second question, just thinking about fiscal \u201913, Carol, it sounds like you expect moderate gross margin expansion. I would expect that you\u2019re going to have some mix pressure, at least in the first half of the year from some of the lumber and Hurricane Sandy. So if you can walk us through the gross margin drivers. And then thinking about that comp, which sounds like it\u2019s pretty conservative, is there any risk you would be underinvesting in anything? Or can you react pretty quickly as the sales pick up?\nCarol Tome : Let me answer the latter part of your question first. We do have a conservative point of view here, and as a result, we have a conservative inventory plan. You saw that we drove our inventory turns up 2/10 year over year. We\u2019re not planning to do that in 2013.  We\u2019ll get a little productivity off of inventory, of course, because of the great work that\u2019s coming out of supply chain and our stores and our merchants. So we are going to be cautious on the inventory front so that we are ready if the sales are there.  In terms of the gross margin expansion, we are planning for gross margin expansion in every quarter. The drivers of gross margin expansion will be continuing benefits from both operational and merchandising initiatives. Shrink has been a real home run for us, but we\u2019re not done. Marvin and his team are doing a great job there. We continue to invest in new tools that are helping us on the assortment of our products.  So while there may be some mix pressure, [unintelligible] on our portfolio, and so we feel good about that. And we do have margin benefits coming from the acquisitions. While they\u2019re adding some expenses, they\u2019re also adding gross margin. So when we say moderate, it\u2019s more than the 10 basis points that we reported in 2012. And Craig, I don\u2019t know if you want to give any color on anything here?\nCraig Menear : Again, we\u2019re looking at how do we continue to drive productivity within our assortments. As Carol mentioned, we\u2019re investing in enhanced tools for our merchants to be able to, in fact, develop our assortment of strategies inside of line structures, as well as clusters across the country, so that we can make sure that we give Marvin and the stores the kind of assortments they need in the appropriate areas. And we have plenty of opportunity to continue to work on that.\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear next from Kate McShane with Citi.\nKate McShane - Citi: I know it\u2019s still early days of your buy online, pick up in store initiative and ship to store initiative, but I wondered if it has started to have any impact on the comp at all this quarter, when we can expect that it will start to have an impact.\nFrancis Blake : We\u2019re a ways from having that have an impact on our comp. We view it as really foundational in terms of convenience for our customers, and our focus has been just making sure that we execute this well online and in the stores. And as I said, are really pleased. We track our customer service survey scores on this very closely, and they\u2019ve improved substantially over time. But it\u2019s not a near-term contributor to our comp. \nKate McShane - Citi : And it is rolled out to every store currently?\nFrancis Blake : Buy online, pick up in store is in every store. Buy online, ship to store is in the process of being rolled out, and will be completely rolled out by the end of the quarter.\nCarol Tome : I think we\u2019re in 522 stores. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. \nPeter Keith - Piper Jaffray: I wanted to ask about the SG&A for the fourth quarter. I think if you strip out China and the extra week, it looks like you got about 90-100 basis points of leverage, which is fairly comparable to the earlier quarters of the year. Yet the Q4 comp was surprisingly strong. So was there anything in there that sort of limited the expense leverage that you saw more recently? \nCarol Tome : We were very pleased with the performance in the fourth quarter. We were $63 million over our expense plan, but the really great news is that\u2019s related to success sharing and bonus for our team. So as Frank mentioned, we had our highest payout of success sharing ever for the back half, over $100 million going to the associates in our stores. So we\u2019re very excited about that.\nPeter Keith - Piper Jaffray : On a separate topic, I was curious just about the general comp trend through the year. It\u2019s good to hear that everything\u2019s going to be running positive. Is there anything we should think about with Q1 given a little bit tougher compare and [weather] pull forward? That might be one of the weaker quarters of the year, and even now, should we think about Q4 as we look out toward the end of the year?\nCarol Tome : Yes, think about the shape every year like a bell curve. So the first and fourth quarter will be the lowest-comping quarters of the year.\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear next from Greg Melich with ISI Group. \nGreg Melich - ISI Group: I had two questions. First, on cash flow, if you look at your cash from operations guidance, it seems like working capital is at least a few hundred million benefit. If you could help us sort of figure that out. Is it payables? Especially given that there\u2019s some inventory investment? And also capex, why is that creeping up? What\u2019s that on?\nCarol Tome : First, on the cash flow, we generated from the business about $7.5 billion in 2012. That was $900 million higher than our plan. And if you look at the big contributor to that - lots that goes in and goes out - but the big contributor is the cash that we received from stock option exercises. If you look at the cash flow statement, I think you\u2019d see a line, something like $700 million, almost $800 million from stock option and our employee stock purchase program with cash.  We didn\u2019t plan on that. And as we look to 2013, we\u2019re not going to plan on that again. If it happens, that\u2019s good news for everybody. But we\u2019re not planning on that. So year on year, we\u2019re forecasting our cash from the business will be about $7.2 billion.  In terms of where we\u2019re investing, think about it broadly. The capital that we\u2019ve targeted for next year of $1.5 billion, 29% of that will go into IT. The rest will go into the business. The IT spend will be flattish year on year, about $430 million. Where the $200 million increase is, year on year, is in key initiatives, and I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples. We\u2019re spending $100 million in our U.S. retail business in support of really value-creating projects like building automation and re-lamping some of our stores, which will have huge IRR. And then were\u2019 investing in our supply chain in support of our interconnected retail business. We need to invest in direct fulfillment, and we are. So our year on year investment in supply chain is up a lot of $60 million. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group : That\u2019s super-helpful. And then second, and this is maybe a broader question on the consumer, I think Frank, in your prepared comments, you talked about credit availability still being a constraint for the consumer. Could you help us get some insight on that in terms of your own credit penetration growth and the things you\u2019re doing to help the consumer out in this environment?\nFrancis Blake : Our private label card is doing well, and Carol can comment on the increased penetration we\u2019re seeing in the card. We can help with our private label card, as you suggest, but this is more broadly in terms of how customers with their homes, the access they have, either when they\u2019re buying a house or if they\u2019re trying to get a line of credit from the house.  And that is quite constrained versus prior times. The average FICO scores for people applying for mortgages now is well over 700, and I think at least for us, as we talk to financial institutions, there\u2019s still a great deal of pressure on just the mortgage lending side of the business. \nCarol Tome : Our private label penetration jumped in the fourth quarter 93 basis points. So a little over 23%. We were pleased with that. If we look at what\u2019s happening inside the portfolio, our consumer approval rates just sort of flattened out at 68%. That\u2019s down from a few years ago. It\u2019s really the result of the CARD Act. Thinking it would be helpful to consumers, it\u2019s actually limiting credit. On the pro side, what we\u2019re seeing as the pros come back, some of our lower quality pros are applying and are not being approved. Our approval rates for pros is 68%, but that\u2019s down from a year ago, which was north of 70%. So what we\u2019re doing in that regard is having a third party take a second look. And if they take a second look, there may be ways to get credit to these customers. So we\u2019ll do what we can without taking undue risk in the portfolio.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Carol, you said you have the $4 billion of additional capacity, and you would be willing to do that. Any thoughts on the timing of that given where credit markets are and how you\u2019re thinking about that?\nCarol Tome : A few thoughts, actually. We\u2019ll be visiting with our board on this topic later this week. I would say we wouldn\u2019t do anything until we filed our 10-K. And that\u2019s in the March timeframe. We\u2019d also look at other big issuers who are coming to market, because we don\u2019t want to crowd the market. We\u2019d like excellent execution, obviously.  So you could envision, perhaps, some in the springtime, some in the back end of the year. We do have a little over a billion dollars that comes due in December. That would be an opportune time to refinance that and do something else. So we\u2019ll come out with more specificity once we\u2019ve got it all worked out. \nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James : And then just two other quick questions. Sandy gave you a $242 million benefit, I think, in the quarter, and that was a $130 million comparison positive from year over year. How should we think about that for 2013?\nCarol Tome : First, on the quarter, $242 million gross, $112 million net, year on year comparison. And so if we think about how to think about this for \u201913, we use Irene as the basis. Irene, we had $360 million in 2011. For the back half of 2012, we had $312 million. So at least there\u2019s $48 million, we think, of sales that could come our way in 2013. Now, Sandy was bigger than Irene, we understand. But it\u2019s really impossible to project how much more will come our way, just because the nature of the damage was so very different than Irene.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James : Understood. And my last question is, you us week 53, out of $1.2 billion, and what was week one, and what\u2019s the difference that goes into the comp base this year versus last?\nCarol Tome : I think it\u2019s $1.6 billion. So the comp base will be higher in the first quarter than it was last year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets: You made the comment that we\u2019re not at full recovery of housing. What would you expect a full recovery of housing to look like? And what kind of an impact do you think that would have on your business at this stage?\nFrancis Blake : Again, in June we tried to set out what we thought were some of the parameters for the work-out phase and then the full recovery. And some of the determinants of full recovery would be an increase in household formation. So we\u2019re talking about 1.2 million households formed. That would be a driver that you\u2019d see. An increase in housing turnover significant above where it is now. Again, housing turnover is better, but a further increase. And then as we get through to that strong recovery, credit availability becomes a key determinant, and an easing up of credit, and in that scenario we\u2019d see our business performing in the 2-plus basis points over GDP. \nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets : And then you made comments regarding improving pro sales, and we also saw a big jump in the big ticket sales. I know some of that stuff was generators and whatnot that contributed to that, but is there a correlation between those two?\nFrancis Blake : Between the improvement in pro sales and the Sandy-related activity?\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets : Not Sandy, but the $900-plus ticket bucket.\nFrancis Blake : Well, the generator activity was really tied to Sandy. The pro, for us, does have a bigger ticket, but I\u2019d say the call out really was more around generators and appliances for us in the quarter.\nCarol Tome : Here\u2019s an interesting statistic from our consumer insights group. And I think I\u2019m right on this. Our average pro spends a little over $6,000 with us. They shop 60 times a year. So that gives you an idea that they\u2019re shopping frequently. Not such big ticket, but frequently.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays Capital. \nPriya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital: As we think about you progressing towards your leverage target, should we think about you getting to that this year, or is that something we should expect over a multiyear process? And secondly, as the housing market continues to improve, how should we broadly think about the need to maintain A ratings?\nCarol Tome : Let me answer the last part of your question first. We are committed to the A rating. We think it provides us the financial flexibility that puts us in a good place, and we\u2019re staying there. In terms of your first question, we\u2019ve got $4 billion of capacity today. We don\u2019t see any need for our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio to fall. So as we are contemplating raising incremental financing, if we do it this year, we would do no more than $4 million. \nOperator: We\u2019ll hear next from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer : The first question I had is, I guess, a follow up to a couple of the prior questions with respect to the comments you made, Carol, about taking on additional leverage to buy back stock. Just so I\u2019m clear, should we view this as incremental to what you had said before about capital allocation? Or is this consistent with the plans you\u2019ve laid out before? Then along the same lines, to the extent you actually move ahead with this, if you take on more debt, would any buybacks under that fall within the $17 billion authorization you have out there?\nCarol Tome : Our actions are all under our capital allocation umbrella and the principles that we laid out and reiterated in our press release today. So we have a $17 billion authorization, which we plan to complete by 2015. We will purchase $4.5 billion this year with excess cash, and if we raise additional debt capital, we will buy additional shares. But it wouldn\u2019t increase the authorization, that in would just be within that existing authorization.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer : And then just maybe a follow up, if I could. I think a lot of us right now are trying to gauge what stage of the housing recovery we\u2019re in, the sustainability of this. Now that we\u2019ve seen better and better results out of Home Depot for several quarters, if you look back at some of the markets, [that were first to] begun to recover, maybe those that were most beaten up through the housing downturn, how would you characterize the performance of those markets for you now versus some of the markets later to the recovery? \nFrancis Blake : The hardest-hit markets, so if you think about Florida and California, have been performing well for us. Slightly above to slightly below the company comp average, Florida performing slightly better, the West Coast slightly worse. We\u2019re starting to see recovery in Arizona, which has been very steady over time, which is very encouraging. And as Carol made the comment a few calls ago, we\u2019re not seeing the enormous variation among all of our markets that we saw during the really tough times in the housing market. We\u2019re now getting more bunched performance on the positive side. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company:   In terms of the sales improvement in Q4, you gave us a little bit of color on some of the components of that. I\u2019m interested within the underlying business if there are categories where you have started to see progress. I know that in appliances that sounds like a response to some good strategies and execution on your part, but are there other categories that you\u2019ve started to see come to life, either in Q4 or the second half of \u201912 that you think are notable?\nCraig Menear : We\u2019re really pleased with the strength across the store. Fourteen or 15 departments had positive comps, seven of our departments ran above the company average. So we start with the fact that we\u2019ve been working hard to develop that strength across the store. I would say that the categories like flooring, like organization, garage organization, we\u2019ve begun to see some real strength in those businesses. So those have been an improvement during 2012. So that\u2019s encouraging to see. But it\u2019s pretty widespread right now, across the core of our store, which is really what we\u2019ve been focused on.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company:   And then as a follow up, as you think about \u201913, within merchandising is you see these trends and other trends within the business. Is there anything that you\u2019re doing differently in areas that you\u2019re trying to place a greater emphasis on? Small ticket, big ticket, discretionary, repair? Is there any position of [unintelligible] or inventories that you are considering or implementing in response to what you saw in \u201912?\nCraig Menear : Our supply chain capabilities to make sure we\u2019re in a position to be able to react for those businesses as well. And then we\u2019re continuing to focus on technologies that the customer sees as real advantages. The growth in LED, the growth in lithium technology, the growth in water savings or time-saving products for our consumers and our pros is really\u2026 We\u2019ve shared that in the past, and that remains our key focus as we move forward.\nDiane Dayhoff : Thank you everyone today for being on our call.

[Operator Instructions] Beginning today's discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nDiane S. Dayhoff: Thank you, Vicky, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors, and as a reminder, we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up, please. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387. Now before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrancis S. Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $18.1 billion, up 4.6% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.2%, and our diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the closure of our stores in China were $0.74. Our stores in the United States had a positive comp of 4.3%. We faced a difficult year-over-year comparison in the quarter, particularly in our Northern division because of the overlap from Hurricane Irene last year. Despite this, all 3 of our U.S. divisions had positive comps. The Southern division was our strongest division for the quarter. Of note, all of our major markets in Florida showed quarter-over-quarter comp improvement, and in the Western division, our major markets in California had growth rates above the company average. Both of these are signs, we believe, of a continuing healing in the housing market. In all 33 of our top 40 markets had positive comps, and our markets with negative comps were primarily in the Northeast. On the international front, our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps for the 36th quarter in a row, or 9 years of quarter-over-quarter positive comps. In Canada, we had positive comps for the fourth consecutive quarter, as Bill Lennie and his team continue to improve our business there. And during the quarter, we announced the closure of our big box stores in China. After several years of effort, we concluded that we could not make our big box retail model profitable there. As you will hear from Craig, in the U.S., we continue to see strength in the core of our store and the company had solid growth in both transactions and ticket in the quarter, making this our sixth consecutive quarter with transaction and ticket growth. We also continued to see recovery in our Pro business. Our Pro sales grew during the quarter, though at a slower rate than our consumer business, due in part to comparisons to the strong sales in roofing from last year. On a regional basis, it's encouraging to see our Pro sales growth matching consumer growth in key areas like northern California and Phoenix. During the quarter, we also rolled out several enhancements to our Pro website, including a bulk pricing program online that mirrors our in-store bulk pricing program, and Marvin and his team continue to focus on improving the in-store experience for our Pros. We look at customer satisfaction surveys for both our Pro and consumer segments, and our Net Promoter Score for Pros is now consistently over 70%, as is our consumer score. Our installed services business had another quarter of positive growth, with strength across the country and in all key programs. This is another critical area where we have implemented improvements to our website, in this case with a functionality called MyInstall that's specifically designed to improve the transparency and communication in install projects and to simplify the customer experience. We will be adding capabilities to MyInstall throughout 2013. In the quarter, we completed the purchase of U.S. Home Systems, a kitchen and bath refacing business. This company's business was already effectively 100% Home Depot-based, but the acquisition will allow us to create more effective interconnection between our stores and the U.S. Home Systems in-home selling platform just as we've done with our roofing, siding and windows businesses. We continue to work on improving our supply chain, and in the quarter, we completed the mechanization of all of our Rapid Deployment Centers, which will further improve the cost effectiveness of this platform. Disasters such as Hurricane Sandy create enormous demands on a supply chain, and our team responded. To date, we have shipped approximately 4,000 truckloads of product to assist the communities impacted by the storm. As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are updating our earnings per share and sales guidance for the year based on our outperformance in the third quarter. We anticipate that over several quarters' time, Hurricane Sandy will have an impact to our sales comparable to that of Hurricane Irene, but the exact timing of that is uncertain. As a more general comment on our market, we believe the U.S. is still working through the issues associated with the housing crisis. Credit availability remains a major issue. But we can start to see the housing market as an assist to our growth rather than an anchor. That is consistent with the national numbers which now show housing as a positive contributor to GDP. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP has improved for the fourth consecutive quarter to 2.5%, though it is still well below previous historical lows, not to mention its 60-year average. Based on this quarter's results, 95% of our stores would qualify for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. This is a reflection of the hard work and dedication of our associates, and I'd like to give a special thanks to all of our associates who have worked to help the communities impacted by Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Isaac. They have worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances, often in the face of disruption in their own lives caused by the storms. Helping in a time of need is a core part of The Home Depot culture, and we are very proud of their efforts. And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig A. Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance in the third quarter as sales exceeded our expectations. The departments that outperformed the company average comp were lumber, decor, kitchen, paint, lighting, bath, electrical, outdoor garden, indoor garden, hardware and flooring. Plumbing, tools and millwork performed positively, while comp sales in building materials were negative due to a tough year-over-year comparison in roofing. In the last week of the third quarter, we experienced around $70 million lift in sales, including batteries, flashlights, generators and extension cords as customers in the North prepared for the threat of Hurricane Sandy. Looking ahead, it's difficult for us to forecast the magnitude of ongoing cleanup sales in the affected areas. In the beginning of the third quarter, I told you that we'd be setting our holiday assortment in half the time previously required by leveraging our supply chain and merchandising execution teams, and we did just that. The objective was to extend our fall cleanup selling season and allow time for an additional fall event, which exceeded internal expectations. These efforts along with great fall weather drove double-digit positive comps in walk-behind mowers, riding mowers, pressure washers, exterior stain and chemicals. Portable outdoor power, exterior paint, lawn accessories, soils and mulches, fertilizers, grills and planters all performed above the company average comp. Patio furniture and live goods had a positive performance in the quarter as well. In the third quarter, we began setting some of our appliance showrooms to include Electrolux, Whirlpool and Frigidaire brands. We will complete the rollout of our 120-store pilot during the fourth quarter. These appliances are available online through homedepot.com and can be ordered in all of our stores. And we are pleased with the results we have seen so far. For the balance of the business, we continue to see momentum in maintenance and repair and simple decor. On the maintenance and repair side, departments such as hardware and electrical as well as categories such as cleaning and plumbing repair continued to perform positively. Bath, lighting, flooring and interior paint performed well within simple decor. As part of our interconnected retail strategy, we are inspiring and educating our customers through our Style Guide available on the Web and for the iPad. The Style Guide is rated 4.5 stars out of 5, and it is consistently a top 100 app in the App Store. And this week, we will launch the holiday version of the Style Guide. Total transactions grew by 1.7%, while average ticket increased 2.9% for the quarter. Our average ticket increase was impacted somewhat by commodity price inflation from lumber. The total impact of the ticket growth from commodity inflation in lumber was approximately 70 basis points. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were flat for the third quarter. Transactions for ticket over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 4.3% in the third quarter. The drivers behind the increase in the big ticket purchases were strength in appliances, flooring and in-stock kitchens. Now let me turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Innovation remains a key part of our leadership strategy. And one of the products we're excited about is our second generation Ryobi lithium batteries with fade-free power. Our lithium plus batteries offer better performance for existing tools, fuel gauges and extreme weather performance. We bring to market the looks customers want with the features they need. In the fourth quarter, we will be exclusively launching a new wood plank look porcelain tile from MARAZZI. This new product will give customers the ease, maintenance and durability of a porcelain tile with a wood finish they desire. Additionally, we'll introduce the Moen Haysfield motion-sensing faucet exclusive to The Home Depot. This faucet delivers consistent hands-free activation even when the handle is in the off position, with 2 sensors that provide flexibility and convenience in many kitchen tasks. We are also the exclusive home improvement launch partner for Kidde's worry-free smoke alarms. These alarms utilize lithium technology eliminating battery changes for 10 years, saving our customers on average $40 in battery replacement while enhancing safety. And finally, we have an outstanding offering of products in our Gift Centers for the holiday season and our best lineup yet in holiday decor. The offerings in our Gift Centers will feature an extensive assortment of hardware and holiday items for gift-giving and decorating. For Black Friday, we have outstanding special buys with extreme values for our traditional DIYers and professional customers. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I want to remind you that in the third quarter, we closed 7 big box stores in China, and as a result of the store closings, recorded an after-tax charge of $165 million or $0.11 per diluted share. The charge included the impairment of goodwill and other assets, lease terminations, severance and other charges associated with the store closings. In our press release, we provided a supplementary schedule that sets forth the impact of these charges. And for the purpose of today's call, I'm going to talk about our financial performance on an adjusted basis, adjusting out the financial impact of the China store closings. So with that, sales for the third quarter were $18.1 billion, a 4.6% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 4.2% for the quarter with positive comps of 2.6% in August, 5.1% in September and 4.8% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 4.3% for the quarter, with positive comps of 3% in August, 5.2% in September and 4.6% in October. On an adjusted basis, our total company gross margin was 34.6% for the quarter, an increase of 22 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business drove 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter, while our international business, principally Canada, contributed 9 basis points of gross margin expansion. In the U.S., our gross margin expansion is explained by the following factors: First, our shrink reduction efforts are gaining traction, and we realized 10 basis points of margin expansion due to lower shrink. Second, we experienced 7 basis points of margin expansion due to lower costs in our supply chain. And third, we experienced 4 basis points of gross margin contraction due to a change in the price and mix of products sold. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 93 basis points to 24.2%. Our expense leverage reflects our strong sales performance and some favorable year-over-year comparisons. Year-over-year, we had $21 million of natural disaster expense that didn't repeat this year. Additionally, our credit card expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $37 million lower than last year due primarily to benefits arising from our private label credit card program. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $150 million, a slight decrease from last year. On an adjusted basis, our income tax provision rate was 36.4% in the third quarter. Let me note that on a reported basis, our tax rate was 40.2% in the third quarter because we didn't realize any tax benefit from the charges associated with the China store closings. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.74, an increase of 23.3% from last year. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.63, reflecting the $0.11 per diluted share impact of the charges associated with our China store closings. A few other items of note. During the third quarter, we opened 2 new stores in Mexico and closed 7 stores in China for an ending store count of 2,250. At the end of the third quarter, selling square footage was $235 million and total sales per square foot were $307, up 4.6% from last year. At the end of the quarter, inventory was roughly $11 billion, up $243 million from a year ago and inventory turns were 4.6x, up from 4.3x last year. We ended the quarter with $41.7 billion in assets, including $2.6 billion in cash. Moving to our share repurchase program. In the third quarter, we received 5.6 million shares related to the true-up of an accelerated share repurchase or ASR program we initiated in the second quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter, we repurchased $700 million or $10.2 million of our outstanding shares. This included 900,000 shares repurchased in the open market and 9.3 million shares repurchased through an ASR program. For the shares repurchased under the ASR program, this is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon completion of the ASR program in the fourth quarter. Further, we plan to repurchase $700 million of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases to $4 billion for the year. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 16.1%, 200 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2011. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are faced with unknowns surrounding the magnitude of the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy that is home improvement-related and the speed with which impacted areas will recover. In addition, we are heading into the winter months where weather could hamper the rebuilding efforts. Our hearts go out to those who were impacted by this horrific storm, and we will do our best to be there when our customers need us. But forecasting the impact of damage-related sales prospectively would simply be a guess. So our guidance for the year is going to reflect our performance for the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, coupled with our plan for the fourth quarter. And given our third quarter performance, we are lifting our guidance. We now expect fiscal 2012 sales will increase by approximately 5.2% on a 53-week basis. From an earnings per share perspective, remember that we guide off of GAAP, so our guidance includes the $0.11 per diluted share impact related to the China store closings in the third quarter. We're projecting fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 18% to $2.92 on a 53-week basis. So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And Vicky, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: First question is just on Sandy, and I understand the difficulty in projecting anything at this point given the amount of damage and the speed with which recovery is done. But Craig, it sounded like firstly, you said that you thought the overall benefit or overall impact to be similar to Irene. And I guess I'm wondering why it wouldn't be larger given a larger magnitude of damage. And Carol, did you just imply that your guidance for Q4 does not include any impact from Sandy, and how do you reconcile those 2?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Right. Well, let's just start with the impact from Irene. Last year, we had $230 million of sales from Irene in the third quarter, $130 million of sales from Irene in the fourth quarter, for a total of $360 million of sales. And of course, it's a rough estimate but this is our best guess of the sales coming off from the hurricane. So we would envision going forward, we would have at least $360 million coming off of Sandy. The property damage, as we understand it, related to Irene was about $16 billion. The property damage for Sandy is about $20 billion. So it would suggest possibly higher sales, but it's impossible for us to know right now. As we look at our guidance for the fourth quarter, you are correct. We are including no benefit from Sandy in our guidance because again, determining what it will be prospectively is very difficult. I will say however that our sales for November are quite good. But interestingly enough, the strength is coming out of the West and the South and not so much out of the North, because as you all know, our customers are still very, very much in turmoil. You may have personally experienced some of this yourself. So this is going to be a different type of recovery than what we've seen in the past. Would you agree, Craig?\nCraig A. Menear: Yes, I think it is. I think the other comment I'd make, Colin, is it's a different storm than Irene. This was much more impacted in terms of water flow, Irene was stronger wind impact. So there's a little different needs that exist in this storm versus Irene.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. Then my follow-up is on expenses. If I look at the expenses last year and back out the Irene impact of $21 million, and then I back out the $37 million of credit benefit this year, it looks like kind of trying to normalize that, SG&A or operating expenses were up about 2.2% year-over-year. Is that a kind of a normal growth rate you're thinking about now as you work through some of the benefits? And while we're on expenses, depreciation was up year-on-year for the first time since 3Q '08. Is that now -- have we reached the bottom in declining depreciation with more system spending going forward?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, let me answer the last part of that question first. Yes, because the investment in IT, and we write our IT investments off over a shorter time frame, typically no longer than 6 years, we anticipate that you will start to see year-over-year increases in depreciation. And that's an okay thing, because the IT investments that we're making are giving us a positive ROI. From a normalized SG&A perspective, as we've told you back in June, we would expect long-term that our expenses would grow around 38%, 40% of our sales growth. This year, it's going to be a little bit different than that. On a 52-week basis, if you back out the impact of China, our expense growth will be basically flat. But on a normalized basis going forward, we would expect more in the 38%, 40% area.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.\nPeter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just diving into the categories a little bit more. Craig, maybe can you talk to us about the trends you're seeing in the window business? How is that been going the last few quarters, and what's your outlook there?\nCraig A. Menear: So we actually had positive comps overall in our millwork business, and our window business has come back from previous years, which were hit pretty hard during the downturn. So we've actually seen positive growth. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nPeter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes. That's helpful. And then maybe just between your larger Pros and your smaller Pros. I know you guys have spoken in recent calls about the larger Pro doing better, any indication that smaller Pro is starting to see some of that as well?\nFrancis S. Blake: The larger Pro is still doing better, Peter.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDaniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: My question was regarding your comments about credit expense being lower year-over-year, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on that. And then secondly, on the inflation front, what you're expecting with building material inflation in the coming quarter -- or in the fourth quarter, I should say?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Sure. Well, as it relates to our credit expense, as I think you will recall, we've kept our cost of credit at 1.3%. So we do share in the profitability of the portfolio. And the portfolio this year is more profitable than it has been, for a couple of reasons. One, higher sales, that's a good thing. But also, the net losses in the portfolio are down. In fact, we're projecting that the loss rate will be below 6% by year end. Contrast that to 2010 where the loss rate was 14%. So as the portfolio becomes more profitable, we share in that profitability. On the inflation side?\nCraig A. Menear: Yes. As it relates to inflation, obviously, lumber prices are remaining at this stage of the game higher than previous year. We've seen some drop in copper as it relates to year-over-year in the past few weeks. So our anticipation at this point is that we'd probably see similar type of movement in lumber. Don't see anything really taking that down short-term.\nDaniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So about another 70 basis point benefit you think to Q4 comps from that sort of thing?\nCraig A. Menear: No, the penetrations change quarter-to-quarter.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Coming back to the topic of Hurricane Sandy, can you just give us the number of stores that you think will be impacted by this event versus Hurricane Irene to give us some indication of the order of magnitude?\nFrancis S. Blake: So Michael, I would say there'll be a fewer stores. The breadth of Irene, it impacted more stores than any storm in our history, certainly when we've taken -- when we've looked at that. So it declined some with Sandy, but as Carol and Craig were discussing, the nature of the damage also was more severe. So there'll be fewer stores impacted, but the impacts might be more significant with those localities.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And will it be a significant amount -- well, will the delta between the number of stores be significant?\nFrancis S. Blake: I mean I'd say it depends what you'd say is significant. But if you say 1/3 fewer stores just kind of ballpark but take that only directionally. Yes, so a significantly fewer number of stores. It's less, but again, the magnitude of the damage faced in those areas is higher.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Let me just say we are going to have some fun planning these store sales trying to determine which stores get the impact from the hurricanes. But we'll do our best in that regard.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. And then a question on the strength you're seeing in the Southern markets, in the Western markets. Is the consumer behaving any differently with respect to the good -- the selection of good, better and best products? So as the cycle manifests, might you have to assort a little differently to meet customers' changing tastes, and could that impact your margin?\nFrancis S. Blake: So, Michael, I'm really not seeing that much geographically that's different. So it's not as though the California consumer is coming back, but is more on the opening price point or mid-price point. There really -- we're not seeing that much of a difference regionally.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So you're really just seeing more folks participate in the market?\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes, correct.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.\nThomas J. McConville - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: This is actually TJ McConville filling in for Budd. Frank, in your commentary and in the release, comments related to housing, I mean I think you noted we're still in the work-through phase, but it certainly sounds like you're incrementally a little bit more positive. Can you talk about maybe what you're seeing in the progression of the recovery and how that affects your -- some of your long-term targets maybe that you talked about at the Analyst Day in June?\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes. First, I'd say the comments are very much in line with what we said in June, that we see housing having to go through a workout period, and we'd say we're in that workout period now. That's a positive though because we're working through issues, and now housing is a little bit of an assist rather than a negative. It was interesting just when we look at the number of times used the word consecutive as we've gone through just this earnings call, we've had a number of quarters of consecutive performance that starts to give you some confidence that the market is healing. There are still lots of issues out there. There are a lot of credit issues in particular that we're concerned about, and obviously, broader policy issues. But if you look at our performance this year and take a 2-year quarter-over-quarter, our business continues to progress.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: We might add a little more color perhaps on the housing, Frank, if that would be helpful. We've got a high level and I'll call it imperfect model, but we have looked at drivers of housing that could impact our business, focusing principally on turnover. And if you look at how housing turnover is performing this year, on an annualized basis, about 4.5 million units. We know from a study back in 2008 that the average spend is about $3,500. If you then calculate our market share against that and look at our anticipated comps to be versus GDP growth, we would estimate that housing turnover is impacting our comps by about 50 basis points this year. So as Frank pointed out, we're on the path of recovery.\nThomas J. McConville - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful, Frank and Carol. I appreciate that. And then moving along to some of those policy issues that you may have noted there, Frank. Can you talk about maybe what some of the outlook is or what the planning is from a resource allocation and capital allocation perspective on what the potential impacts of, let's say, what a fiscal cliff might look like, specifically, maybe your dividend versus repurchase decisions or something like that?\nFrancis S. Blake: I think we'll wait until we let the policymakers resolve those issues before giving you hypothetical responses to them.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Laura Champine with Canaccord.\nLaura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Along those lines, what, Carol, is your estimate for the impact of the changes in health care regulation in 2013?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Laura, we're still working through this. It's highly complicated for all of corporate America, but with a company like The Home Depot with over 300,000 associates, we've got to study this very carefully. And we're waiting for the rules to get formalized. So once we know, we will tell you.\nLaura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Okay. And then on the appliance store pilot, how are you judging success from a quantitative basis? And if you are successful in whatever the metrics are you're looking to achieve, how large could that rollout be across your chain?\nCraig A. Menear: So as we do with every pilot and every reset in our stores, we obviously go through a financial assessment of what we're looking to achieve, and we lay out targets for that. It's very early at this stage in the pilot. We haven't completed our 120-store rollout yet, we still have that to finish in the fourth quarter. And we do like the early results that we see. Based on how the rollout continues and how the sales perform, we would then determine what the next steps might be and how many stores that would actually roll to.\nLaura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: And are you looking for incremental sales per square foot, or what are the metrics that you're looking to see improve?\nCraig A. Menear: Yes, certainly that would be -- one of the metrics that we look at is exactly that, how do we actually continue to drive incremental sales. Yes.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: The really interesting thing about our approach here is that it's not just a store story, it's also a dot-com story. So we really like the penetration that the new brands are selling on our website. And Craig, you might want to talk about that.\nCraig A. Menear: Yes. The -- all of our brands are obviously available on homedepot.com for our customers to shop around the clock when they choose to shop. And likewise, we leverage homedepot.com and our delivery system to make those brands available on all stores today.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: Wondering if you could talk a little bit, you highlighted the big-ticket progress in the quarter. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're doing promotionally within big-ticket and across the business. And then also if you could link that a little bit to how you think the gross margin progression works from here.\nCraig A. Menear: Well, I'll address the big-ticket aspects. When you look at our growth in big-ticket, it's a culmination of a lot of things. Hard work by our associates in the stores. We've worked hard on the assortments over the past few years. Kitchens, for example, continue to be a positive growth story as they have been for the past couple of years now. We feel like we're taking share in those areas. We've improved our flooring business overall. As a matter of fact, Eric, what I would say is that if you looked at our decor businesses in total, they actually outgrew the company average. So I think customers are beginning to be willing to step in and do the decor projects like flooring, like kitchens. We've had a nice quarter in appliances as well. So I think it's a combination of a number of things, including an assortment, our effort by our associates and our stores to drive this business.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: On the gross margin front, we would expect the fourth quarter gross margin to be flattish relative to last year, principally because of what we're anniversary-ing. You'll recall, the fourth quarter of 2001, we had 53 basis points of margin expansion coming off of our supply chain. We're not expecting that in the fourth quarter of this year.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: And then if I could just follow up, Craig, in terms of the promotions in decor, you talked about gaining share. Would you say that year-over-year promotions across those categories are similar to a year ago, more promotional, less promotional, how would you characterize that?\nCraig A. Menear: Pretty comparable to where we were a year ago.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Gary Balter with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nGary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: First, a comment, doesn't count as a question. Could you get more generators in your store in Vauxhall, New Jersey?\nFrancis S. Blake: We're working hard on more generators.\nGary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Could you -- Frank, you sounded more positive overall on signals of a housing recovery, and you walked us through the numbers, and we heard like consumer spending is just as strong as the commercial spending. What are the signals -- could you go a little deeper into what you're seeing that builds that confidence up?\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes, sure. Part of it is, Gary, if you think back to 2011 where we had some strong quarters: second, third, fourth quarters, very strong. Each one of those quarters had its unique weather story. So it was difficult to kind of pull the strands out of what's more weather-related, what's the housing recovery look like. It felt like that was sort of the start of housing starting to heal but a little cautious about it. We've had -- this third quarter is an interesting quarter because it was a very tough compare for us, given the sales related to Irene, as Carol detailed. So the positive comp in this quarter, which again not really Sandy-related, Craig called out $70 million at the very end of the quarter. So the positive results in the quarter, combined with as I said, every quarter this year on a 2-year stack basis doing better, and again going to Craig's comments, strength in the core of the business, you go, we're starting to see -- I mean this isn't -- we're not lighting rockets over this and we don't want to get out over our skis, but we're starting to see the recovery of the housing market. And then -- I mean there are lots of data points that we look at this on, obviously. Geographically, the harder hit areas that were really the epicenter of the housing crisis appear to be on the mend and it's been consecutive, it's been consistent. So that's why we think it's healing.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just curious, given where we are in the housing cycle and what appears to be a market still concentrated, if I'm listening to you right, Frank, in the basic repair and remodel portions of the home improvement markets, are you surprised at all that transactions under $50 aren't a bit stronger than flat?\nFrancis S. Blake: So Craig, you want to just...\nCraig A. Menear: Yes, I'll talk to that a little bit. So when we look at transactions under $50, there is an awful lot of those transactions that fall into a few categories, very pleased with how we did in outside garden as you can imagine. That's a big transaction driver in that business. But then when you look at kind of what has happened in some of the categories, the average unit retail growth, so for example LED versus incandescent bulbs, has had an impact on that business. When you look at the expansion of what's happened in the retail side of the business in paint, you see transactions that maybe have fallen from what were under $20 to now over $20. And then there's some actions that we've taken as well in terms of how we're driving some off-shelf special buys, packs, value packs that have led to part of that shift in transactions under $20.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Got it. Understood. And then you had also, Craig, mentioned something about fourth quarter aggressive holiday deals, et cetera. Is that something you saw in the third quarter, or is that just an expectation that pricing will become more aggressive in the fourth quarter? Or is that just the normal holiday aggression in promotions?\nCraig A. Menear: Yes, as it relates to the fourth quarter, I mean we're excited about the plans we've put in place to aggressively go after the market. We have -- our merchants have worked hard to really create some outstanding values for our customers. We've got awesome values in our Gift Center. We've got a great holiday decor lineup. We do have outstanding values that we'll bring to the market around Black Friday, which is obviously a very aggressive time in retail. So we're excited about the offerings that we have forthcoming in the fourth quarter.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And don't forget, in the month of December last year, we had a positive comp in the United States of 7.1%. So we better have a good holiday to comp that.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So first, I wanted to follow up on the health care question. I understand it's very complicated and you're not sure what's going to happen, but maybe just help if you could remind us how your health care works now? Who is covered in terms of your part-time and full-time employees? And you stopped telling us your percent of part-time employees in your 10-K, but has that changed very much since the last time you reported that, which I think was 55% or 59% in the 2010 10-K?\nFrancis S. Blake: Yes, first off on the -- on what we provide, and now this is speaking U.S., obviously. We provide health insurance to our full-time associates. For our part-time associates, there is a company -- in effect, we make available to them what might be called a mini-Med [ph] program. In terms of the ratio of full-time and part-time, I'm not sure when was the last -- I don't think there's been a major difference from the last time we disclosed.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: No. There's just not a major difference, no.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. So -- but your in-store employees, full-time employees who aren't necessarily store managers, they are currently, what percentage of those are currently covered?\nFrancis S. Blake: Well, so we make it available to all of our associates. And Mike, one of the questions for us is, and we're not going to get into our specific percentages on this, but one of the questions is, for us, in thinking about this program and understanding it and understanding the cost implications, is for those associates who do not now take advantage of the health care that we provide, why don't they take advantage of it? Are they covered by their spouse? Are they not taking the health care because for whatever reason, they don't choose to spend their money in that direction? And then as you shift into health care legislation, what will the impact of the health care legislation be on those associates? All of those in addition to the regulatory issues that Carol referenced that still need to be resolved, there's sort of a base understanding that we need to develop on what behavioral changes this will create within our full-time associate ranks, and that has a significant impact on how we estimate the cost. So as Carol said, as soon as we feel comfortable and confident of what the impacts will be, we'll be sharing that with everyone.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Fair enough. One more real quick one. The guidance, the full year guidance, that excludes the $0.11 impact from China. Does it include the $0.03 benefit roughly that you had in the first quarter?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: It does.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: My first question, you've addressed sort of the magnitude of the impact you expect from Sandy on the top line. Can you talk about its impact up and down the P&L? For example, you spoke about some storm-related expenses from last year that you cycled and were not repeated in Q3, but we see those in Q4. How you think about storm-related sales perhaps impacting the gross margin rate as they drive sales over the remainder -- over the next several quarters as well?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Of course. Because Sandy was so coastal on its nature, and we don't have stores built along the coast, we were very fortunate and we had little to no damage in our stores. So do not expect any storm-related expense in the fourth quarter. We do have a Homer Fund, which is a 501(c)(3) that we've established that will take care of our associates in need but those -- that won't impact our P&L. From a margin perspective, it really is going to depend on the products that are sold.\nCraig A. Menear: Yes. Short-term, we're still selling things that have lower gross margins. So we're still selling generators, that type of product, lumber to get basic repair done right now. And it really depends on how the sales progress from here as to what the whole [ph] mix of sale will be, which will determine where the margin falls.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And again, rather than trying to guide to that prospectively, we'd rather explain to you what we experience.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then the second question I have relates to buyback. So you've had one of the most successful and effective capital allocation programs in retail. Virtually every share you've ever bought back, given the stock today, is in the money. So that's worked out extremely well. You've shared with us in the past your intrinsic value calculation, that you've used to think about the buyback. What is your thought process in the buyback, and you said $700 million for the fourth quarter, in the short run and the long run with the stock having done so very nicely and the kind of approach you would expect to see? Any change in that from where we've been in the past year or 2?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, first, Matt, thank you for your acknowledgment of our program. We have bought back about $37 billion worth of our shares at an average price of about $37. So the program has worked. And we do have a point of view on the value of our stock, and we're not there. We also look at it, what's the point we should retire debt versus buy back shares, so we've got a mathematical calculation that supports our activity, and we feel very committed to our share repurchase program where we are based on that point of view and the fact that sitting on cash on the balance sheet is not very value-creating for our shareholders. And just to that point, you'll note that at the end of the quarter, we had $2.6 billion of cash, so you may say, aren't you a little heavy? About $1 billion of that cash is outside the United States. We could get our hands on it, we could repatriate it, but then we pay a nice tax on that, so we elect not to. So when I think about the cash that we have available for use, it's about $1.6 billion, and we need about $1 billion-ish to operate. So that's what's giving support to the $700 million that we will buy in the fourth quarter. And one last comment on the share repurchase, as you know, we introduced new financial targets back in June, our 12-24 target, that's 12% operating margin and a 24% return on invested capital by 2015. Inherent in that 24% return on invested capital is that we will use excess cash to buy back shares.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Just a couple of quick ones. Carol, just to make sure the numbers you put out there for Irene and Sandy, net-net for the quarter storm demand would be a net negative, correct, year-over-year?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Yes, sir.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Okay. And then as you think about the housing recovery and some of the things you've talked about from a bottom up, can you maybe put a little bit more color behind either at a market level or a state level sort of which would be at the top of that list, either the 33 markets or across the states where you're seeing the strongest year-over-year growth today?\nFrancis S. Blake: So if you just look at the third quarter, Dennis, we saw strength, as I referenced, in Florida. We saw strength in California that was above the company average, which as I said, was to us a sign of a healing in the market. And elsewhere, we were more -- as Carol has commented before on these calls, the range of difference among our top 40 markets has actually compressed over time. We were sort of past the period where we'd have major markets that were significantly double-digit comping in comparison -- double-digit negative comping in comparison to other markets.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: So if you look at Florida and California as an example, would the growth rates for those states put them in the top 5 across your network?\nFrancis S. Blake: So I was looking at it from the market perspective. And if you looked at the top performing markets, then Florida would be at the top for the company.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And in California, the growth rates are between 50 and 180 basis points better than the company average, just to give you a point of perspective.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from David Gober with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I just want to dig back a little bit into kind of what we're seeing in terms of the recovery. And Frank, I know you've talked a little bit about how you'd expect to further lead in a recovery and some of the characteristics you expect to see there. Just curious why you think that's maybe more of a coincident indicator at this point. And we're starting to see ticket pickup but that Pro is still more or less in line with the overall company average. What do you think is different than you would have expected, and maybe than what you've seen in prior recoveries?\nFrancis S. Blake: So first off, David, I don't know that we can speak to prior recoveries because we really didn't have the data to analyze the differences. And I'd say the basis for our expectation, if you remember, we go back to 2008, 2009 and particularly post Lehman, our Pro business dropped off at a significantly steeper rate than our consumer business. Both were going down, but our Pro business was going down quite a bit more. So we had a theory, which today it looks so far so good, that as the market recovered, the Pro would start to pick up and would be part -- a key part of that recovery for us. Where I'd say we are now, where the numbers say we are now and as we called out in June sort of a workout phase, the Pro is recovering and -- but it's not yet at a point where it's surpassing the recovery of the consumer. And again, as we've referenced, the larger Pro is coming back a little faster.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And just to put that into perspective, the larger Pro makes up 13% of our Pro sales. So the majority of our Pro sales are the smaller ones.\nDavid Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got you. That's helpful. And just a little bit more on the geographic mix. I mean I think what we've seen over the last couple of years is a greater level of growth in urban and maybe close suburban areas. Are you seeing any signs that the geographic mix within markets is changing? I mean obviously, you addressed the Florida and California issues, but given that we've started to see signs that household formation is picking up, are you see the mix within markets change at all?\nFrancis S. Blake: And shifting more to our more urbanly focused stores? No.\nDavid Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: No, sorry. I mean the other way around, maybe more towards suburban and ex-urban areas than where it's been in the last couple of years.\nFrancis S. Blake: I'll be honest, David, no. We haven't seen that.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So I wanted to follow up on the capital allocation question. I think that your view has recently been you didn't need the cash and rates aren't going up anytime soon, so there was no rush to add debt to fund the buyback. However, the other side of this is the stock price. So while it's below where you think it's worth, the market maybe is ahead of where you thought it would take it, and now you have an incremental positive view on housing, November is off to, what sounds like to a strong start, you have this potential bridge from Sandy over the next 2 quarters of tough weather compares. So I guess devil's advocate, why isn't now a good time to go add debt to the balance sheet and buy the stock below where you think it's worth?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, all good questions. Here's our point of view on incremental debt. If you look at our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we're standing at 1.7x against a maximum target of 2x, which would suggest by the end of the year about $3 billion of debt capacity, more or less. As we look into 2013, a couple of things. There is the fiscal cliff issue and we'd like to get through that because as we've talked about in the past, raising debt in an environment of high beta doesn't make a lot of sense, and there is no higher beta in my opinion than the fiscal cliff. Now, we'll know soon where that ends up. We've got $1,250,000,000 coming due in December of next year, we're going to refinance that. Gives an opportunity to add some incremental debt once we get through the fiscal cliff if we so desire. And when we make that decision, we'll let you know.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Fair enough. And then just as a follow-up on the shrink side, which is perhaps the only other question that hasn't been asked yet. It sounds like you said you're early on in the process, and really the first quarter that you've talked about it. So what are you doing there that you haven't done before? And do you expect this gross margin tailwind to sustain itself?\nMarvin R. Ellison: Chris, this is Marvin Ellison. Shrink really for us has in the past been a really good news story. This early part of this year, we had underperformance, and it's really a refocus. A refocus on operational process, refocus on merchandising, of packaging standards, just a refocus on execution. We have a new leader in the role. We have a really strong commitment involvement from all of our associates, and we're pleased with the performance in the second half of the year, and we're optimistic that the performance will continue for the balance of the year, and we'll take that into 2013.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And you may recall when we set forth our 12-24 targets, 12% operating margin, we showed a walk on the gross margin line and there was an element of the walk that we called operational excellence, that's code for better shrink performance. So to Marvin's point, between now and '15, we continue to expect better performance there.\nMarvin R. Ellison: And I think, Chris, it's probably worth noting that we've gone through quite a few process changes over the past 3 years. And what process changes really creates uncertainty and a different view of transparency on how you impact shrink. So we had to make adjustments in the stores to really alter our processes to meet the needs and the understanding of our new process. So we feel real good about where we're headed, and again, we hope to keep the performance going into next year.\nOperator: We will take Alan Rifkin with Barclays.\nAlan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just one last question, Carol, on Sandy. I mean realizing that obviously it is difficult to forecast revenues coming from the storm, if you believe that in the quarter, during the storm and following the storm, the benefits from Sandy will be equal to that of Irene, that would imply about $290 million realized in Q4, which would equate to about 180-basis point benefit on the comp line. Is that something that would be reasonable for us to expect?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: You need to build the models the way you build your models. We've given the guidance that we've given based on our plan because we just don't know how to forecast prospectively.\nFrancis S. Blake: So, Alan, one thing just to keep in mind of why we're a little cautious on this and the comparisons to Irene may not be direct is you've got very different weather circumstances. So last year following Irene if you'll remember, fourth quarter was one of the warmest winters ever in the Northern division. And that helped in the Irene recovery. Don't know obviously sitting here today, what's the weather going to be like in New Jersey and New York as we head into the end of November and December and that will have an impact on the recovery efforts. So that's -- I mean, we've spent a lot of time thinking, \"Gee, what's the right way to approach this issue for the fourth quarter and frankly the first quarter of next year.\" And that's why as Carol said, what we think is better is to tell you, \"Look, here is roughly what we think Irene did. We think this is give or take, comparable to the impact of Irene.\" But the timing of it for us is just very uncertain.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And I'll just pile on, we went back and studied every hurricane. And the average time to recovery is T [time] plus 6 months, with the exception of Katrina. This storm in many ways is like Katrina. New Orleans is still rebuilding. So you can -- I hope you can understand why we are cautious in our outlook regarding the storm-related sales.\nAlan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure. No. Okay. I appreciate that, Carol. One last question if I may. Carol, you said that in the fourth quarter you're expecting gross margins to be flat despite the anniversary-ing of more than 50-basis point benefit less from the supply chain rolling off. In terms of the incremental gain to the gross margin, do you see that? And obviously you've spoken about shrink [indiscernible], do you see any changes in the mix benefiting your gross margins in Q4?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, as Craig pointed out, we are a seasonal business. And if you look at lumber, we would expect a lower penetration of lumber in the fourth quarter, which would help our gross margin, as an example.\nDiane S. Dayhoff: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to have you join us when we report our full year quarterly and fourth quarter earnings at the end of February.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's teleconference.

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today's discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDiane S. Dayhoff: Thank you, Alicia, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up, please. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387. Now before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our experiences and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrancis S. Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $20.6 billion, up 1.7% from last year. Comp sales were positive 2.1%, and our diluted earnings per share were $1.01. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 2.6%. From a geographic perspective, all 3 of our U.S. divisions had positive comps. As expected, comps for the northern division, our largest division, were below the company's average because of this year's early spring, which pulled seasonal sales forward into the first quarter. We continue to see recovery in the markets that were hit hardest in the downturn, particularly Florida and California. Their comp performance improved from the first quarter and they were among our best comping regions in the second quarter. For the half, we had solid performance across the country with only one of our top 40 markets with negative comps and that was just barely negative. As Craig will detail, we see strength in the core of the store, and customers continue to engage in simple decor projects. Our customer transaction growth was down sequentially from the first quarter, but that's largely a reflection of the seasonal shift from the early spring. Our Pro business grew in the quarter. This is another positive sign because Pro sales face a difficult year-over-year comparison with last year's strong roofing sales due to storm repair. We also had double-digit growth in our services business, with strong growth in our kitchen installation business where Marvin and his team have focused on improving the customer experience. Our customer satisfaction surveys now show that we can deliver an installation experience that consistently hits at or above 9 on a 1 to 10 customer satisfaction scale. Our services business has now seen 7 consecutive quarters of growth. Much like the Pro customer, this business was under disproportionate pressure during the downturn. On the international front, our Canadian business posted positive comps for the third consecutive quarter with comps above the company average in local currency. And our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps, making it 35 quarters in a row of positive comp growth. As we discussed at our Investor and Analyst Conference in June, we have a number of strategic initiatives underway to position our business for a best-in-class interconnected retail experience. These initiatives touch every part of our organization. On the dot-com side, we relaunched our mobile website for homedepot.com. Our upgraded mobile site provides significant new functionality including the ability to buy online and pick up in-store and this now represents over 35% of our mobile sales. The in-store execution of Buy Online Pick Up In-Store is a focus for Marvin and the store operations team. We take surveys from our customers on our performance, timeliness, completeness of orders, ease of transaction and Marvin has set the same objectives for constant improvement in customer satisfaction as we have for our in-stock business. We are also preparing for the launch of buy online ship to store this year, which will significantly expand the range of options available to our customers. On the merchandising side, Craig and his team continue to expand the breadth of SKUs available online. And organizationally, we had integrated online and in-store data, pricing analytics and product line review teams along with our merchant teams. This may not sound significant, but it's a key step in driving our own interconnection as those teams are now responsible for thinking through the full customer experience regardless of whether it begins in the store, on the computer or on the smartphone. Last week, we opened a new call center in Utah to support our interconnected business and we'll open another call center in Georgia this quarter. We've also begun the development of new distribution centers to support direct-to-customer fulfillment and expect to complete this effort over the next 2 years. You may have noticed the addition of new decor offerings as part of our usual second quarter storage event. We're leveraging the capabilities of our Home Decorators Collection business, which began and continues as a decor-oriented catalog and online business, but which also adds a design capability for us that we're now using for branded in-stock products. In the quarter, we also launched our first pilots with our Redbeacon platform. One of the advantages of the online space is that it gives us the ability to experiment, expand offerings and test the leverage we can generate from the combination of our physical and virtual presence. As we look into the back half of the year, there are positives from the first and second quarter that give us some confidence. Weather aside, we see strength in the core of our store, stabilization within the hardest-hit housing markets in California and Florida and signs of gradual improvement within the overall housing market. Housing now is a contributor to GDP growth rather than a drag, and private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP improved in the quarter. As we've previously discussed, we view our business as more correlated to GDP growth than the housing market given the current depressed levels of housing-related spend. Consensus GDP estimates have been revised downward lately, which would indicate more downward pressure than upside opportunity in our sales guidance. But as Carol will discuss, given our out performance in the first half, we are maintaining our sales growth guidance and our raising our earnings per share guidance for the year. Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication. Based on this quarter's results, all of our U.S. stores, every one of them, qualified for our first half Success Sharing. As a reminder, Success Sharing is our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. This is a record level of participation for us with the highest ever Success Sharing payout and we're very proud of that result. And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig A. Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We finished the second quarter with solid results. There were 3 main drivers to the quarter's performance: first, the core of the store delivered in line with expectations; second, as we shared with you in the first quarter, record-setting weather in February and March pulled forward activity that otherwise would have occurred in the second quarter; and third, we lapped the impact of significant roofing repairs made in the same period a year ago. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were decor, lumber, kitchens, paint, electrical, tools, bath, flooring and plumbing. Hardware, lighting and millwork performed positively while sales in garden and building materials were down. The impact of the weather and drought-like conditions caused our garden business to be slightly negative, and comp sales in building materials were down due to tough year-over-year comparisons in roofing. Last year, we experienced several storms in the Southeast and repair activity in the North, which drove our roofing sales. In the quarter, the core of the store continued to perform. Maintenance and repair categories such as lightbulbs, appliance parts, safety and security, wiring devices, plumbing repair, pipe and fitting and builders' hardware performed above the company average. Project completors such as power tools and accessories, electrical tools, tape, adhesives, lubricants and fasteners also positively comped. And as I've shared in the past, the customers continue to spend on simple decor updates for their home. We saw double-digit positive comps in spray paint, laminate flooring and area rugs. Wall d\u00e9cor, organization, paint, bath accessories, specialty carpet, door locks, hard window treatments and wood flooring all performed above the company average. Total transactions grew by 0.6% while average ticket increased 1.8% for the quarter. The average ticket growth was positively impacted by commodity inflation, which contributed approximately 50 basis points in comp as well as strength in larger ticket categories. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down 0.7% in the second quarter. We believe this is a result of the pull forward of seasonal sales into the first quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.4% in the second quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were strength in HVACs, appliances, kitchens and flooring. Now let me turn our attention to the third quarter. In addition to the GDP headwinds Frank mentioned, we'll also face tough sales comparisons resulting from the impact of last year's Hurricane Irene. The impact from lapping this storm is factored into our plan for the third quarter. We're pleased with the outstanding offerings, incredible values and special buys our merchants have created to drive business in the third quarter. Recently, we announced an expanded appliance line, including Electrolux, Whirlpool and Frigidaire. These appliances are available online through homedepot.com and can be ordered in all of our stores. Additionally, in over 100 stores, we plan to expand the footprint of our appliance showroom to display the broader brand presence. Coming this fall, our Husky brand will experience several product upgrades. We are introducing new lines of a Husky hand tools for both the Pro and DIY customers. The new assortment offers industry-leading quality and innovation. Husky products are exclusive to The Home Depot. And we've ramped up our air compressor mix to feature up to 9 new Husky SKUs. And we will complement the Husky hand tool mix with new Husky tool storage solutions. We continue to bring innovation and value to Husky soft-sided storage. And in the third quarter, we're excited to reintroduce our line Husky steel storage products, including the new mechanics tool chest designed with 50-pound ball bearing drawer slides, heavy-duty casters and lid reinforcements with gas struts. We also will be the exclusive home improvement launch partner of the new Delta brand toilets. This new line of product includes innovative features such as SmartFit tank-to-bowl connections and integrated supply lines. Also from Delta, 16 new SKUs of Foundations-branded faucets will be added to our assortment, a brand the resonates with our Pro customers. Innovation in key technologies is also part of our leadership strategy. We continue to be innovative in LED and we will be introducing 15 new lightbulb SKUs in the third quarter. These lightbulbs are the second generation of product from our original line of EcoSmart LED bulbs and will deliver a new look, improved efficiency and better lighting experience. Also, we'll be launching 41 new LED fixtures in stores during the third quarter, and we'll continue to offer an enhanced selection of over 1,000 LED fixtures online. And finally, with capabilities created through our supply chain transformation, our merchandising execution team and partners in operations, we will be setting holiday at the end of the third quarter in half the time previously needed. This improvement will allow us to extend our fall cleanup selling season. And with this activity, we believe that we will deliver within -- sales within our expectations. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $20.6 billion, a 1.7% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 2.1% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.4% in May, negative 0.4% in June and positive 3.1% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 2.6% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.6% in May, positive 0.2% in June and positive 3.8% in July. The variability in our monthly comps was due, in part, to year-over-year comparisons and the impact that weather and storms had on our sales. Our total company gross margin was 34.2% for the quarter, an increase of 17 basis points from last year, of which 15 basis points came from our U.S. business. In the U.S., we experienced 4 basis points of gross margin expansion arising from lower costs within our supply chain, and the remaining 11 basis points of gross margin expansion was due primarily to a change in mix of products sold, most notably a lower penetration of roofing sales this year versus last year. For the year, we continue to expect moderate gross margin expansion. In the second quarter, operating expense, as a percent of sales, decreased by 98 basis points to 21.7%. Our operating expenses declined $125 million from last year due primarily to the following factors: first, in the second quarter of 2011, we had $42 million of expense related to the impairment of Chem-Dry and natural disasters that did not repeat; second, this year, we experienced $42 million of favorability in our workers' comp reserves; and third, our credit card expense was $40 million lower than last year, reflecting lower debit card fees and a higher penetration of private label credit sales, coupled with the lower cost of private label credit. For the year, we expect expenses to grow at approximately 10% of our sales growth rate on a 52-week basis. Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $151 million, a slight increase from last year. Our income tax provision rate was 36.6% in the second quarter. And for the year, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.01, an increase of 17% from last year. Moving to our operational metrics. During the second quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico for an ending store count of 2,255. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 236 million and total sales per square foot were $350, up 2.2% from last year. And now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $10.9 billion, up $150 million from a year ago, reflecting purchases made for our upcoming holiday season. Inventory turns were 4.7x, up from 4.4x last year. We ended the quarter with $42 billion in assets including $2.8 billion in cash. Moving to our share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we received 2.8 million shares related to the true up of an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR program, we initiated in the first quarter. Additionally, in the second quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion or 23.6 million of our outstanding shares. This included 2.1 million shares repurchased in the open market and 21.5 million shares repurchased through an ASR program. For the shares repurchased under the ASR program, this is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon the completion of the ASR program in the third quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 16%, 250 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2011. As we look ahead, we see signs of slowing U.S. economic growth, but housing appears to be a bit of a bright spot. August has started off in line with our expectations. Based on our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to project fiscal 2012 sales will increase by approximately 4.6% on a 53-week basis. From an earnings per share perspective, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We exceeded our earnings per share plan in the second quarter, and with that out performance, we are lifting our earnings per share guidance for the year. We now project fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 19% to $2.95 on a 53-week basis. This earnings per share guidance includes $2.6 billion of share repurchases completed in the first half and our intent to repurchase an additional $1.4 billion of outstanding shares in the back half of the year. So we thank you for your participation in today's call, and Alicia, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company.\nDaniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could just share with us maybe a little bit more color on your web sales performance as you've been making investments in that area of the business. If you could discuss a little bit about what's selling best, what's happened as you've made price investments in that area? What the average ticket looks like and the margin behind that versus the store?\nCraig A. Menear: So Dan, this is Craig. We're very pleased with the direction of our business online. We do view this as total commerce because there's many projects that actually start online and actually complete in-store. When we look at -- we've made some significant investments in our online business. We upgraded to WebSphere 7. Big effort behind that, improved speed dramatically for our customers as well as features that allow the customer a better shopping experience online overall. And so we're very pleased with the performance where approximately 2% of our sales roughly come through our online business directly.\nDaniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then as a follow-up, could you discuss a little bit about how the Pro customer is doing versus the consumer in terms of comps by group?\nFrancis S. Blake: So Dan, this quarter, the Pro customer sales growth was lower than the consumer. But as I noted, if you take out -- we did have, and you heard it both in Craig and Carol's comments, we did have some tough comparisons on roofing. When you take out roofing, they were pretty much the same; same level of growth between the Pro and consumer. So we're very pleased with that because, as you know, this is one of the indicators for us of our business recovery.\nOperator: We'll go next to Budd Bugatch from Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I guess I want to talk a little bit about the SG&A performance, which was terrific and I think the best SG&A ratio since maybe the second quarter of '06. Carol, you called out, I think, 3 items that explain sort of a difference between this year and last year. Can you talk -- and you talked about what you thought would be the ratio or the growth going forward, but can you kind of give us maybe the callouts as to what you think affects the third and fourth quarter? Do the working capital reserves, is that a true up that still affects third and fourth quarter? And the credit card expense, how do you think that will fare for the rest of the year?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: I'm happy to do so, Budd. We were pleased with our expense performance in the second quarter for sure. And as we look out for the back half of the year, we do expect expenses to be higher in the back half of the year versus last year relative to expenses being under the first half of the year for a couple of reasons. We talked to you about the fact that we are investing in interconnected retail. And that includes the new call centers that Frank mentioned, broadband expansion inside of our stores, delivery for dot-com. So we're making some investments in the back of the year, which will cause our expenses to be higher than they were last year. But we should see continuing benefit coming off of our credit card. And as it relates to workers' compensation expense, you'll recall that during our Investor Day, we called out an expense opportunity with regard to our casualty reserves. And in fact, we've called out that we thought we could get about $100 million between now and 2015. So we were pleased with the benefit that we saw in the second quarter. I wouldn't expect that to repeat in the back half of the year, but I would certainly expect to see continuing benefit between now and 2015.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And as a follow-up, just as a quick follow-up, I go back long enough to remember when you used to parse out the operating expense by store expense and G&A expense. Can you maybe give us a little bit of a read of how that affects or how that looks today?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Yes. Well, as Frank pointed out, we are so thrilled that 100% of our U.S. stores are in Success Sharing. And so if you think about what that means for bonus payments, bonuses are up year-on-year and we're thrilled with that. But we are able to offset that cost through cost-out in other areas. And I \u2013 we didn't spend a lot of time going through it, but we continue, Marvin and his team are doing a masterful job of leveraging payroll by moving ours away from selling -- non-selling tasks to selling and it's working very beautifully for us.\nOperator: We'll go next to Aram Rubinson from Nomura.\nAram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Couple things. One at your Analyst Day, you gave us kind of a breakout of 4 different product categories: one that you'd want to own in the store; one that's online know-how and in-store pickup -- and in-store experience; one that's kind of growing across channels; and one that's kind of more a defend share. I'm wondering if you guys look at comps or sales trends by each of those buckets because of the online significance in there and curious how that's trended year-to-date?\nCraig A. Menear: Aram, I would say that we, candidly, we look at the comps across each of the businesses. I haven't exactly totaled them by those 4 categories. But inside of those, we certainly look at it. So if you remember, the categories in the red at highest risk. Actually, right now, we're performing very well in those categories. We like that. The areas in the yellow were growth opportunities, both in-store and online. And some of those are some of our stronger growth areas that we're seeing, particularly in our online expansion as we broaden the assortments in a lot of the simple decor categories. And then, if you recall the lower left-hand side, which was kind of more maintenance and repair and things that we felt would have less pressure, we experienced some pressure in that business as it relates to garden with the pull-forward from first quarter and the drought conditions that impacted things like live goods and so on.\nAram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Well, I'm very impressed that you remembered all those bucket offhand. And then, one quick follow-up, your DSOs were flat -- I'm sorry, your DSIs. Your inventory days were flat. Wondering if you can kind of characterize the balance inside the mix and whether or not kind of having the lawn and garden being kind of outsourced really help save the margins or how that would have looked otherwise?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, we were very pleased with our inventory performance. Turns were up year-on-year, that's how we look at it. And as we mentioned in the call, we have made purchases for our holiday season, many of those purchases coming from outside of the United States. We have paid for those. But the inventory's on the water making its way to the stores.\nAram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: You don't feel heavy anywhere is what you're saying?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: I feel really good about inventory levels, don't you, Craig?\nCraig A. Menear: Yes, I feel very comfortable with where we're at, overall, in inventory.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Yes.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kate McShane from Citi.\nKate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I was wondering if there was any more detail you could give behind your Buy Online Pick Up In-Store and how that may be contributing to the comp and what you're expecting the contribution to be from this buy online ship to store going forward?\nFrancis S. Blake: So Kate, it's still a very, very small -- I mean it's a fraction, a fraction of a small part. But it's important directionally for us because we really do believe if you look out over the next 5 to 10 years that interconnecting the virtual physical presence is going to be a key differentiator. So right now -- and then also by the same token, if you looked at comp performance on Buy Online Pick Up In-Store sales, very high growth but it's small base.\nOperator: We'll go next to Colin McGranahan from Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: First question for Carol. Just back on SG&A, understanding those 3 -- those buckets and it was helpful understanding how they look going forward, but if we strip those out, SG&A dollars would have been still pretty flat on the sales per square foot and comp store sales up. So it sounds like you had some labor dollar productivity improvement given that bonuses were higher. Understand the shifting of tasking to selling, but can you comment a little bit about on what labor productivity looked like and maybe where some of the productivity improvements are coming from? And if there was anything else in the other SG&A bucket, advertising or anything else, that was favorable?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Yes, we leveraged hourly payroll by 21 basis points in the quarter, of which 18 basis points came from non-selling. So that's really what Marvin is doing in terms of driving tasks out of the store. Terrific performance. And Colin, as you know, we've got a laser-like focus on cost out, so I can go line-by-line to tell you we were down in common area maintenance. We were down in advertising. We were down in a number of other expense areas as we're just getting much better -- we're running a better business. And Marvin, maybe you want to talk about some of the activities that are going on inside the store.\nMarvin R. Ellison: Yes, Colin, if I can take you back to 2011, we rolled out centralized Return to Vendor. A big, big process change for us, but if you think about it, every store in the chain had a minimum of 40 full-time hours in the backroom processing vendor returns. We stood up [indiscernible] central reverse logistic centers, a big deal, great productivity for us. In addition to that, we worked hand in hand with Matt Carey's team on labor productivity and scheduling. Rolled out a enterprise-wide in the U.S. scheduling system and payroll system for all stores, enabled us to take the schedule-writing process, in some cases, to 3 to 5 days to a matter of hours. So I can go through a list of projects that we put in place to drive productivity in the stores. We're excited about what we've done. We have the 60-40 target that we hope to complete in 2013. And as Carol mentioned, I mean, our goal is simply to figure out ways to take nonproductive, non-service-related payroll and shift it to the sales floor and also to continue to drive profitability.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Great, that's helpful. Sound like a good process going on. Second question for Frank, more strategic. Just on acquisitions, maybe you could talk about what the rationale was behind U.S. Home Systems acquisition during the quarter? And then, thinking about a potential Lowe's acquisition of Rona, how would that impact your thinking and your strategic positioning in Canada?\nFrancis S. Blake: So on the first, on USHS, as you know, really, they were 100% dedicated to The Home Depot or effectively 100% dedicated to The Home Depot. And much like the acquisition we did earlier in MeasureComp, which was also a company that was 100% dedicated to The Home Depot, there are benefits to us to just making it part of the company. There are efficiencies we're going to gain. We think there's a tremendous improvement in customer experience that we can drive as we connect our store experience with that in-home selling on USHS. And I'd also say, on USHS, as you might remember, Colin, many years ago, we bought another company that was exclusively dedicated to Home Depot on in-home selling that did roofing, siding and windows. Marvin and his team have been driving that business. We like the experience that we can provide to customers on that and we want to be able to do the same thing on USHS. And on the second comment, our strategy will remain the same in Canada, and we're very pleased with how we're doing in Canada.\nOperator: We'll go next to Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Can you share your latest thoughts about adding leverage? Holding the trend into year-end seems like your adjusted leverage ratio will decline maybe to about 1.7x. Understand you don't need the cash, but given the rate environment and you're a little bit more positive on housing, can you talk about the decision points on whether you would decide to let the ratio drift lower into year end?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Be happy to. Our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.7x today against a cap of 2x. So we have a little over $2 billion of borrowing capability pursuant to our guidelines, if you will. As we think about when and -- we'll access the debt capital markets, we look at it really from an environmental perspective. And by that, I mean the economic environment, which we would define as pretty volatile. While housing is a bit of a bright spot and that's good news, we wouldn't the call recovery today. We still I think we're in workout phase, working towards recovery. GDP forecasts have come down. We've got an election ahead of us. We have uncertain tax policy. We don't know what's happening in Europe. Chairman Bernanke has said he stands ready to take action, if necessary. So we think there's a kind of beta in the environment and when there's a ton of beta in the environment, not the best time to add debt leverage. So our point of view, Chris, that interest rates aren't moving anywhere. If we thought that there was an opportunity to be lost, we would have a different point of view. But we don't think there is an opportunity to be lost. So for now, we're sticking where we are and we'll tell you what we plan to do when we plan to do it.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So this doesn't -- I guess, given the amount of cash that you have, it doesn't necessarily impact how much you could buy back into the balance of the year?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, as we look at our cash balance, and we are very pleased with that cash balance of $2.8 billion, a couple things to remember: first, we've only spent about $550 million of capital this year against our plan of $1.325 billion, so we've got a lot more capital spend in the back half of the year; second, we need about $1 billion to operate just given the size of our business, the seasonality of our sales, et cetera; and the third, not all of our cash is available. We do hold cash outside the United States, in Mexico, Canada and China. So we'll always have some cash on the balance sheet.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then as a follow-up, you commented that the weather drove some of the variability on the monthly side in the quarters. Was the July acceleration at all weather-driven? And can you share with us whether you see much difference in U.S. comps in 3Q versus 4Q?\nCraig A. Menear: On the weather side of it, July's acceleration wasn't really driven by whether, itself. We had strength across the store in the month of July.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And I'm not sure if your comment was on last year or this year. Last year, in the U.S. comps in Q3 were 3.8%, which about 100 basis points was driven by Hurricane Irene. Comps in the fourth quarter last year were 6.1%, which was driven in large part by that warm weather that we had in December and January. Now, we've planned for that as we built our plan for Q3 and Q4 of this year. So as we look at U.S. comps for Q3 and Q4 this year, they should be more or less in line with what we experienced in the second quarter. Is that helpful?\nOperator: We'll go next to Alan Rifkin from Barclays.\nAlan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I know that you said that ticket was up 3.4% while sales of small purchases actually declined slightly, but could you maybe shed some color on what you're seeing with respect to discretionary items regardless of price point?\nCraig A. Menear: Yes, Alan, I think we're very pleased with things like kitchens, which is clearly a discretionary spend and also a very large spend. The team has worked incredibly hard to build a better experience for the customer, whether that be through the product offerings that we have or Marvin's team and the service group on the install side of that experience and we saw strong growth there and we've grown that business now for almost 2 years. So we believe that we're taking share in those type of businesses. And it's an effort of continuing to remain focused on the value proposition that we're providing the customer in those bigger ticket categories. So whether it's kitchens, flooring, all of those businesses have performed and our sales and tickets over $900 have actually been solid performance, and we believe it's because of the value proposition that we're bringing to the market in those categories and taking share.\nAlan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And one follow-up, if I may. As you continue to grow the dot-com business, obviously, at a greater rate than brick-and-mortar and obviously, I realize it's only about 2% of revenues, do you believe that you're taking share more so from other competitors? Or do you think that there's some cannibalization going on? And can you maybe just shed a little bit of color on how we should be thinking about the inherent profitability of dot-com relative to brick-and-mortar for, let's say, a given product?\nCraig A. Menear: So as it relates to sales, I mean, I think we're taking sales from the marketplace. We do monitor our in-store business in conjunction with our online business. And I would say at this point in time, don't see a lot of cannibalization in the business in total. And so we, again, are focused on the experience that we're delivering to the customer and want to make sure that we're providing an experience that allows us to grow that business by taking share from the market.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And from a profitability perspective, as you know, we're on a path to reach a 12% operating margin by 2015 and that path includes the impact of dot-com.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: One question on the tone of business and then one follow-up on the balance sheet. Alan sort of touched on this a bit, but you talked about what you're seeing in terms of GDP forecasts and then obviously you see the cadence of the business day-to-day and what the rhythm is among categories. Is there anything that you saw kind of Q1 to Q2 x-ing out the weather that would have suggested or substantiated the notion of a slowdown in consumer spending, or are your cautious comments just a function of sort of what the forecasters are saying?\nFrancis S. Blake: So I'd say, Matt, that the cautious comments are a little bit what the forecasters are saying. If you just look at our business and you look at the core of the store and you adjust for the pull forward, you'd actually say the core of the strong was strong in the second quarter.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then Carol, obviously you had 2 quarters in a row of ASRs, which for those of us trying to reconcile shares, that was a bit of a nightmare, so -- I'm sure it's good for the company. If you could give us a sense as to how this sort of trues up as we get through the third quarter and the fourth quarter, what kind of share count we could look for because presumably you'll have a bunch of stock coming out with less of an expenditure in the second half\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, first, let me tell you why we do ASRs. They are a pretty efficient way to buy in big blocks of stocks and they're derivatives, as you can appreciate. And we can set the strike price wherever we want to set it. But the higher we set the strike price, the larger the discount to BWAP. So when we did the ASR for $1.4 billion in the second quarter, we set the strike at $65, which meant we immediately brought in 21.5 million shares. Now obviously, our stock's nowhere near $65. So as the ASR is completed, they're buying the shares in at the price every day. So it'll leverage down considerably. The economic benefit in doing this is almost $0.80 off the BWAP every day. So there's real value to be created by doing it this way. So you pick what the average stock price might be. The ASR expires on August 24. It could close out any time between now and August 24. But I'm thinking we'll get another 7 million shares in or something like that. So hopefully, that will be helpful.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So that comes in addition...\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: To what we've already gotten, yes.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then you've got -- then on top of that, you've got the incremental buyback that you guided to, which we should think about at market prices.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Exactly.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So 7 million comes in with no incremental expenditure. That's the true up.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: That's right, more or less.\nOperator: We'll go next to Greg Melich of ISI Group.\nGregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I had a couple of questions. First, Craig, on the ticket accelerated from 2.2% to 1.8% in the second quarter from the first. Can you describe how weather or perhaps disinflation may have impacted that, especially given that vendors' gross margins have started to improve as raws come down?\nCraig A. Menear: So the ticket improvement really was driven through a number of categories around bigger ticket spends, the HVAC, the appliances, the kitchen, the flooring. A little bit of drag on the bigger ticket was things like tractors, which were impacted both from a pull forward where if you were going to buy a tractor, you bought it in the first quarter, you're done. And as we called out, we estimated that the pull forward in the first quarter from the second would be roughly $125 million to $150 million; that's about what the number was and it impacted categories like tractors.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And Craig, if I can just jump in for a second. There's a currency impact in the ticket in the second quarter. If you look at the ticket growth in the U.S. in Q2, it was up 2.5%.\nGregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then secondly and this is maybe a little bigger picture looking forward for everyone. We now have Affordable Care Act is going to go forward. I'm curious to what you guys have done to sort of start preparing for that, whether it's looking at your full-time versus part-time labor, potentially outsourcing some certain things. I mean, Marvin mentioned re-tasking, maybe putting some business work back on vendors. Just thinking about this bigger picture as to how you guys are preparing for that?\nFrancis S. Blake: So Greg, we're obviously spending a lot of time thinking through the implications of the Affordable Care Act and how we'll respond. But I would tell you we run our business the right way to run our business. We're not going to change full-timers to part-timers because of the health care legislation nor would we outsource work for that reason. The overriding -- the customer experience and what our associates provide to the customer experience in the -- I mean, that's our business.\nGregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Is there something that you're waiting for to be able to make some more decisions about how to do that best? And then...\nMarvin R. Ellison: Oh my gosh, there are so many -- there are a lot of -- there's a lot of regulatory uncertainty still. There are many -- when you get into -- this is obviously a very complex area and we spend a lot of time internally going through the -- here are the different variables that we've got to take into account. And there's a lot that still has to be determined.\nOperator: We'll go next to David Schick from Stifel, Nicolaus.\nDavid A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Two questions. First, how are private label sales doing online would be interesting. And secondly, Frank, you talked about strength at kitchen install, and Craig, you talked about the value proposition that's helping to drive that. But any more detail on labor efforts, staffing, marketing around the incremental share you're grabbing there, as you said, would be helpful.\nFrancis S. Blake: So I'll start on the second one, which is the kitchen sales and in particular just going back to a comment I made on the improvement on our kitchen install side, and Marvin may want to add a comment here. I'd say that one of the important things is the confidence of our associates in selling a kitchen install. And so you really have to look at it as a multi-year effort for Marvin and his team of building up our associates' confidence that when we sell a kitchen installation, it's going to go well. And we do very extensive voice of the customer surveys on this. And Marvin, you might want to add a comment.\nMarvin R. Ellison: Yes. Look, the key is the confidence of the associate. I mean, I can take you back to the days when I was a Division President and you could directly correlate poor-performing stores and markets and kitchen sales to their perception of the quality of the service providers. So to Frank's point, over the last couple years, we've taken some very specific steps in putting all of our service providers through our version of Customer First training. We rolled it out to the store, we rolled it out to the executive team, we figured, you know what, let's roll it out to the service providers because when you step foot in the home, you represent The Home Depot and you should have the same brand standard for customer service. That was a big deal because we'd never really done that before. In addition to that, we put some very rigorous standards in place on the voice-of-customer surveys. We changed the way the surveys are conducted. Now we have a third party that will physically contact the customer after an install and will go through a very brief survey, and we hold our providers accountable for the results. If they perform well, we give them positive incentives. If they don't, they can lose business, and in some cases, suffer exiting their relationship. All that being said, we're very pleased. Frank mentioned early on that our service scores are north of a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. We've never had that before and we've sustained that. Our goal is to improve it. We still have concerns about getting better because we have high standards. But the service quality, the training has really played a big role and to help Craig's team take great value, create confidence and to install it in a way that we think is very consistent with the brand standard of our service proposition to the customers.\nCraig A. Menear: And as it relates to private label sales online where we have categories in-store online with same kind of makeup of private label versus national brand, product and sales are roughly in the same penetration ranges as they are in-store.\nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Lasser from UBS.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: From a product perspective, if you look at the categories that are most below peak volume levels, how did those perform during the quarter and where do you expect them to go over the course of the improvement in the housing recovery?\nCraig A. Menear: So the categories that are kind of past peak that would be those seasonal businesses that we're coming out of Q2. And candidly, the pull forward in Q1 had an impact on them, so businesses -- and as well as frankly some of the areas in the north had an impact from drought. So things like live goods and fertilizer had some weather impacts from the drought in the north. Things like patio and grills and riding mowers that are past their peak, we saw some pull forward from Q1 in those businesses.\nFrancis S. Blake: Michael, do you mean within the year or over time?\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Over time. I meant looking back to the peak of the housing bubble, you're doing 60% of the volume in kitchen remodels that you were back then and those were some of the best-performing during the quarter.\nFrancis S. Blake: You got it exactly right. So if you look over time, the categories that have been hit the hardest are kitchen remodels and you've heard we're improving there. Jobsite tools is always an interesting category because they kind of correlate to job sites and I'd say stabilizing. It's stabilizing.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Lumber as a penetration had a ways to go.\nCraig A. Menear: Lumber as a penetration still has a ways to come back, absolutely.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So you would characterize those categories as some of the better performing during the quarter? And then, I'm also curious about July into this quarter because, again, a historic relationship between the housing market and home improvement would suggest that you're going to start to see some of that activity really take shape in the second half of the year?\nFrancis S. Blake: What I would say, Michael, is that what those categories that were hardest hit would say would be the market is stabilizing. As Carol said, we're kind of in a workout mode. But it's not like this has taken off. It's stable, it's improving and that's a positive in a workout sense, but they're not -- I mean, it's modest.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. It's more of a slow grind higher than a sharp upturn?\nFrancis S. Blake: Right, yes.\nOperator: We'll take the last question from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I guess I was asking a -- going to ask a question fairly similar to Michael. When you look at California and Florida, 2 areas that you basically had highlighted, do you see much of a difference in terms of mix from what you're seeing through the rest of the country, just given the fact that they're coming off such a trough level?\nCraig A. Menear: No, it's not a dramatic change in mix of sale.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Not at all?\nCraig A. Menear: Not really, no. The market's improving, but the mix is about the same.\nDiane S. Dayhoff: Well, thank you for joining us on today's call, and we look forward to talking to you at next quarter in November.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Beginning today's discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nDiane S. Dayhoff: Thank you, Christie, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot; Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, we would appreciate it if participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up, please. This earnings conference call is being broadcast real time on the Internet. The replay will also be available on our site at earnings.homedepot.com. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387. Now before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measures -- measurements is provided in the financial statements included with our earnings release and on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Frank.\nFrancis S. Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $17.8 billion, up 5.9% from last year. Comp sales were positive 5.8%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.68. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 6.1%. This is the second quarter in a row that we have posted a positive comp in the U.S. of over 6%, something we haven't done in 8 years. This was well ahead of our plan for the quarter. And as with the fourth quarter of 2011, unusually warm weather played a significant role. We had the fourth warmest winter in history and also had the benefit of a comparison to a relatively cold winter in 2011. Not surprisingly, the areas of strongest growth for us were in our northern division where we had double-digit positive comps in the regions across the northernmost tiers. By contrast, while we had positive comps in our southern and western divisions, they were mostly in the mid- to low single digits. In all, we had positive comps in 38 of our top 40 U.S. markets and Florida and California continued on the path to recovery. Adjusting for weather impacts and for the pull-forward of activity, the quarter's results were encouraging and consistent with our view that our growth this year will be reflective of broad GDP growth rather than a recovery in the housing market. While there are still some -- while there are some positive signs in the housing market, it is still under pressure. Pricing is stabilizing, but not yet solid. Inventory is down, but shadow inventory remains a concern and credit availability continues to be constrained. In this environment, our customers are looking at DIY projects as a way to save money while they improve their homes. As Craig will describe, we have focused on that need and are providing innovative products at great value to make home improvement simpler and more affordable. Craig and his team are also focused on developing and leveraging our merchandising tools. Our business is obviously impacted by weather, particularly at this time of year, and those tools are critical in making sure we have the right product in the right place in the right quantity as the season breaks. Unusual weather such as this year's presents an additional challenge. As you know, over the last few years we've rebuilt our supply chain and centralized forecasting and replenishment. This quarter was a real-life stress test of these new capabilities. There are always opportunities, but overall, we were very pleased by the response of our supply chain. And we also leveraged our supply chain expense for the quarter and saw turn improvement. We had strong transaction growth in the quarter and at the same time were able to improve our customer satisfaction scores, which is indicative of the progress Marvin and our store operations team are making. We retrained all of our associates on customer service during the quarter as part of our continuing commitment to customer service improvement. On the pro side of our business, we have seen gradual recovery. To give this some context, at the height of the housing crisis, our pro business declined at a much faster rate than our consumer business. Our hypothesis was that the pro would be a leading indicator coming out of the housing crisis. The reality has been more nuanced. We are in fact seeing recovery in our pro business, but the strength within our pro business appears to be developing sequentially within different classes of customers. Our larger pro customers are growing at a faster pace than our consumer segment, but our overall pro business is moving slightly less than the general consumer. This suggests a thawing process with the larger customers recovering first, with, hopefully, stronger recovery spreading throughout the rest of our pro base over time. In the quarter, we upgraded our dot-com platform, enhancing the site's visual appeal and responsiveness. Our apps recently reached a new milestone and have been downloaded over 2 million times. We now have over 500,000 SKUs on our site, including our Home Decorators Collection. We continue to invest in the business, and Matt and his team are providing new tools throughout the company. For example, we have begun the rollout of what we call our First Phone Junior to all stores. This junior version of the First Phone provides our associates a tool that combines the communication features of the phone with a product and inventory lookup features of the First Phone, but without the complex business analytics and product ordering functionality of the First Phone. This allows us to spread the basic functionality of the First Phone throughout the store at a fraction of the cost. On the international front, our Mexican business posted positive comps for the 34th consecutive quarter. And our Canadian business also posted a positive comp, their strongest first quarter comp since 2004. Before I close, let me comment on a small acquisition we just completed. This month, we acquired a flooring, measurement and quote building company, MeasureComp. The company's business was largely dedicated to Home Depot, and by in-sourcing this service, we can build a seamless process for our flooring customers that we expect will provide a far better experience for them and a better close rate for us. As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are raising our earnings per share and sales guidance for the year. This is based on our outperformance to plan in the first quarter, adjusted for the estimated sales we pulled forward in the quarter. We remain focused on taking care of the customer and investing in our business and in our associates. I'd like to thank our associates for their hard work and dedication in the first quarter. Based on this quarter's results, over 98% of our stores would be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. We're very proud of that result. And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig A. Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter driven by continued strength in our core business and enhanced by record-setting weather in February and March. Warmer-than-expected weather allowed customers to complete exterior projects and begin spring projects early. We estimate weather positively impact U.S. comps by 300 basis points, of which between 80 and 100 was an estimated pull-forward of activity that otherwise would have occurred in the second quarter. While northern regions benefited from a strong seasonal business and an easy compare in the first quarter, we were also pleased with the positive performance in southern and western regions where the weather was more normal. Total transactions grew by 3.9% while average ticket also increased 2.2% for the quarter. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 2.4% for the first quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 6.7% in the first quarter. All departments except for 2 posted positive comps for the first quarter. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were indoor garden, lumber, outdoor garden, electrical, decor, paint and hardware. Lighting, tools, millwork, building materials, bath and flooring showed positive comps. Comps in plumbing were flat, and kitchens were slightly negative. Sales in the first quarter were driven by double-digit positive comps in seasonal product categories like Walk Behind Mowers, Riding Mowers, lawn accessories, soils and mulches, chemicals, grills, watering and planters. Fertilizer, exterior lighting, live goods and landscape lighting delivered solid comp performances as well. We also saw double-digit positive performance in the following outdoor project categories: decks, pressure washers, exterior stains, siding, gutters, portable outdoor power, roofing, exterior paint, windows, waterproofers and fencing. In addition to exterior projects and seasonal categories, as I've shared in the past, simple decor categories continued to gain strength. Within our hard surface flooring, the combination of wood and laminate categories led the way with comps in the high teens. We are also pleased to see comp growth in other decor categories like window coverings, bath accessories, vanities, interior paint and ceramic tile. Finally, due to our continued emphasis on providing value for our customers and offering innovative products, the core of the store continues to perform. And we saw positive comps in fasteners, electrical repair, portable power, door locks and pipes and fittings. We continue to offer our customers great values. For the professional electrician, we are introducing new loadcenter value packs. These new larger loadcenters meet the increasing demand for electronics in the home while allowing for better customization per project for our pro customer. We're also expanding our successful SharkBite program by introducing new dishwasher hookups, water heater expansion tanks and many more products for the professional plumber. We launched new brushless motor technology and power tools from Makita and Milwaukee. Brushless motors use energy more efficiently than brush motors, which means more work per charge and a longer maintenance-free motor life. For our do-it-yourself customers, we're introducing new products in decor, including a significant update of our in-stock faucet assortment. We're also announcing the addition of 1-inch blinds from Bali, complementing our Home Decorator Collections premium faux wood blinds. For outside of the home, we have new weatherproofing wood stains from BEHR and new Masonite and Feather River fiberglass doors. Also for Father's Day, we have a strong product lineup in our Gift Centers, and at the end of the second quarter, we will have a storage event, which will feature products from departments across the store and from our Home Decorators Collection. I'd also like to mention the work of our consumer insights team. As Frank said, we're beginning to see a recovery in our pro business and this recovery appears to be sequential, but by only a certain class of pro. This analysis is the direct result of the team's efforts to bring our consumer analysis in-house. The ability to see customer purchase patterns on product and frequency has enhanced our shift from mass marketing to personalized communication. In addition to seeing broad trends in our business, we are now able to analyze specific customer behavior. We can look inside customer segments, for example, painters or electricians, and the data helps our CRM tools, and as a result, led to more productive and successful direct marketing campaigns. As we continue to enhance our attributing capabilities inside our enterprise data warehouse across product, customer and geographies, we will drive efficiency in our response to trend recognition and actions with our CRM team. Finally, this was a demanding quarter and I'm proud of the hard work by our stores, merchants and supply chain as they did a great job to meet the needs of our customers. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $17.8 billion, a 5.9% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 5.8% for the quarter with positive comps of 6.2% in February, 6% in March and 5.4% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 6.1% for the quarter with positive comps of 7.2% in February, 5.8% in March and 5.6% in April. Our total company gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 8 basis points from last year, of which 7 basis points came from our U.S. business. In the U.S., the gross margin expansion can be solely attributed to benefits arising from our supply chain transformation. Excluding supply chain benefits, the gross margin for the U.S. was flat to last year due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold. For the year, we continue to expect moderate gross margin expansion. In the first quarter, operating expense, as a percent of sales, decreased by 109 basis points to 25.1%. Total operating expenses grew at a factor of 24% of our sales growth, better than our original guidance due principally to the sales environment. For the quarter, our operating expenses were within $8 million of our original plan. Based on our first quarter results, we now expect total expenses to grow at approximately 40% of our sales growth rate on a 52-week basis. Turning to interest and other expense. You may recall that we had guaranteed a $1 billion senior secured term loan issued by HD Supply and established a $67 million fair value liability related to this guarantee. In the first quarter, our guarantee was terminated, and as a result, we reversed the liability. This reduced other expense by $67 million and provided approximately $0.03 of earnings per share benefit in the quarter. Our income tax provision rate was 36.5% in the first quarter, and for the year, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.68, an increase of 36% from last year. Moving to our operational metrics. During the first quarter, we opened 2 new stores in the U.S. for an ending store count of 2,254. At the end of the first quarter, selling square footage was 236 million. Total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $304, up 6% from last year. Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $11.6 billion, down approximately $100 million from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.3x, up from 3.9x last year. We ended the quarter with $43.3 billion in assets, including $3.2 billion in cash. We are about $500 million ahead of our cash plan, due in large part to in-the-money stock options that were exercised in the quarter. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.1 billion or approximately 19.4 million shares of outstanding stock, including 2.1 million shares through open market repurchases and 17.3 million shares through an accelerated share repurchase program. The shares acquired under the accelerated share repurchase program are an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon the completion of the program in the second quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 15.4%, 240 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2011. As you've heard, the warm spring weather and continued strong performance in the core of our store drove first quarter sales ahead of our internal expectations. But it's our point of view that the fundamental assumptions behind our 2012 financial plan haven't changed. As a result, we are simply raising our guidance for fiscal 2012 to reflect first quarter outperformance, offset in part by the sales we believe we pulled forward into the quarter. On a 53-week basis, we now expect fiscal 2012 sales to increase approximately 4.6%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. Based on our first quarter results, we now project fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 17% to $2.90 on a 53-week basis. This earnings per share guidance includes share repurchases completed in the first quarter and our intent to repurchase an additional $2.4 billion in shares over the course of the year. Our guidance assumes that share repurchases will contribute about $0.07 of EPS accretion in 2012, offset by $0.02 of dilution coming from shares issued in association with stock option exercises. We look forward to sharing with you a longer-range business outlook at our investor conference on June 6 in Atlanta. We thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christie, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Gary Balter from Credit Suisse.\nGary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just one question, just a follow-up. Your current guidance guides us to about a 10% operating margin and that's with no strong -- with nothing really in the housing market, as you mentioned, and just the beginning of the contract business coming back. In a stronger market, as you look at your -- what you've done internally, what type of margin assumption should -- where do you think you could get to?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, Gary, we have an investor conference coming up on June 6, at which time...\nGary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Am I going to ruin the conference by asking?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: No. Thank you for teeing it up for us actually. We'll talk about our longer-term margin opportunities. We're not stopping at 10%. We have an opportunity, we believe, to grow our margin. If you remember our peak margin, back in 2005, was 11.8%. We'll give you a lot more color on June 6.\nGary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, so that doesn't count as a question. Could you talk about share gains this quarter? Your comps were much stronger than your -- one of your competitors. The other one obviously hasn't reported. What do you think you did in terms of market share for the different categories?\nCraig A. Menear: So Gary, we look at share 2 different ways. We obviously look at the census data from the NAICS. That would actually indicate that we lost share, although there are companies in there that -- much smaller base that had huge, huge gains, which affects the number. And then when we look at the consumer side of independent tracking, which doesn't include our pro business, we gained in 4 departments out of our total. That would've been lighting, lawn and garden, kitchens and millwork. When we try to triangulate the data, working with our suppliers, we do feel that we're gaining share in a number of our business categories. But those 2 indicators are what they are.\nOperator: And we'll go to our next question from Colin McGranahan from Bernstein.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Wondered about pull forward of demand. This is going to be a little confusing, but if I look at the fourth quarter, your 5.7% comp, I think at that point you said weather was a benefit of 200 to 250 basis points. So and I may be getting a little too nuanced here, but if I were to back that out, I'd say the fourth quarter weather-adjusted comp then was maybe 3.2% to 3.7%. If I look at this quarter, you comped at 5.9% and said 300 basis points. So again, little nuance, but backing it out would suggest a 2.9% weather-adjusted comp. So I guess my first question is, is that reasonable and do you think the underlying business actually decelerated by something, about 50 basis points or so?\nFrancis S. Blake: Well, these are -- it's an art as much of a science in terms of what's weather-impacted. And obviously for us, the fourth quarter is a little bit anomalous because it's our lowest volume and heavily driven by how we perform on our -- the seasonal holiday, which was very strong for us in the fourth quarter. I would tell you it didn't feel like the business decelerated. But weather -- I mean, as Craig mentioned and Marvin's here for the store side, boy, our stores were very, very busy. And we had huge transaction growth in the first quarter. So I understand your point, Colin, on weather-adjusted, did we decelerate, but I would say it didn't feel like that.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, that's fair. And again, I know it was a very nuanced kind of thing, just trying to make a little bit more science of it than probably is worthwhile. But then if I think about pull-forward demand, I guess my second question is how could you -- how do you measure that? How comfortable do you get with that 80 to 100 basis point estimate? And if that's the right number, should we think about this quarter being something kind of around a 3% comp -- the first quarter being something around a 3% comp on a weather-adjusted basis? And then back out 80 to 100, to think about 2Q comps something more like in the 2% range?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, let me just share with you the math behind or the science behind the art because we do try to apply some science. We will take 5 years of garden business, looking at the relationship between the first and second quarter, and we'll come up with a ratio that we regress against the first quarter results, which will give us a factor to apply against the second quarter projected sales against our plan. And that's how we determine what we have pulled forward. Again, 80 to 100 basis points of our total comp growth pull-forward, that's about $120 million to $150 million. We then, Colin, do an eyeball test and we look at the categories where we saw sales growth that would be onetime categories, be it a riding lawn tractor or a Walk Behind Mower, that sort of thing, where typically you're only going to buy it once in the season, to give us some comfort that our math is more or less correct. And that's again -- that's in -- just Craig is just asking me to make sure it's clear that when we say weather-impacted of 300, the 80 to 100 is in that 300 number.\nCraig A. Menear: Correct, it's not additive.\nColin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, okay. That's fair. And then my follow-up question, Carol, while I've got you here. Just on OpEx, you said you were within $8 million of the plan from the beginning of the quarter. It seems like obviously you probably hadn't planned for comps this strong. So were you able to just deal with the labor as it was because the productivity is so much better, or did you add labor as sales picked up and found other places to take out?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, we leveraged payroll in the first quarter, but the stores did an awesome job of staffing up to meet the sales demand. And Marvin, you might want to comment on that?\nMarvin R. Ellison: Yes, Colin, we put in a new labor system, scheduling system, last year. It was part of our 60/40 initiative work with Matt and his team to get this in place. It was a big undertaking, but it really paid dividends this quarter because we were able to have our labor meet our sales demand and schedule and forecast to that in a more effective manner. For the first time, our store managers were able to track their labor versus their sales performance on a daily basis. We've never been able to do that before. So that enabled us, not only to meet the demand, but also to make the right investments in departments like live goods where, for the first time, we actually experienced a customer service score increase in the live goods area during the season. Typically, for us, Q1, we take a really big decline in service scores in that seasonal area, so we made a labor investment based on the new system and we actually saw improved sales as the numbers reflect. But in addition, we saw improved customer service scores. So we feel good about the process and we feel good about the leverage we were able to create because the leverage was created on top of increased sales and top of increased customer service scores.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Couple questions. So first, on your pro commentary, the largest customers recovering faster and sequentially, but the rest really not recovering. I guess what's been the discussion internally on what you think that represents and what customers are on the other side of that transaction and what projects that they're doing?\nFrancis S. Blake: So Chris, I'll give you a hypothesis, but again recognize this is just a working hypothesis and we'll have to see as this goes forward. The first just comment to make is I was, in the commentary, differentiating between the pros, our larger pro spend customers and our smaller pro spend customers. Pro, overall. So in both segments, it's recovering where we're seeing outsized recovery versus our consumers with our larger pros. I'd give a hypothesis that credit has something to do with that. That those are the larger, more creditworthy firms. And as you think about kind of a thawing process, it sort of makes sense that they'd start picking up business in advance of some of our smaller customers. That's a theory. As Craig said, we've got a lot more analytics that we now have at our disposal to put to the question and hopefully over time we'll get more and more refined on exactly what's driving that difference.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And we can give you some numbers behind the comments that Frank just shared with you. If we look at the insights, consumers grew about 7% in the quarter, pros grew about 5%.\nFrancis S. Blake: Sales.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Thank you, in their sales growth. And then our larger pros, those who spend more than $10,000 with us annually, they grew around 11%. That's about 12% of the pro base.\nMarvin R. Ellison: So Chris, this is Marvin. The additional point to that, probably the vast majority of all the growth, as Frank mentioned, came from those large customers. And so in addition to credit, it's also moderate demand. When demand is moderate, those smaller pros don't get the subcontracting jobs that they typically get. And what happens when there's high demand is that the large pros can't handle all the work that they get and so residual work kind of falls down to some of the smaller GCs in the marketplace. But when demand is moderate, and as Frank mentioned it's recovering, those larger pros can take those jobs and it meets their work schedules and their capacity. So we feel good about the moderate recovery, but until we see every pro in our demographic start to benefit, then we stay a little cautiously optimistic that it's recovering, but not fully.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So does the larger pros imply larger products like new builds versus renovation? And then as\u2026\nFrancis S. Blake: No, Chris, it's not. I mean this isn't a sign of, hey, homebuilding's coming back and remodeling not, no.\nCraig A. Menear: No, we're actually seeing, with those pros, an improvement in the number of transactions. So they're just -- they're getting more repair jobs and we're seeing that type of business.\nChristopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got you. And then just quickly on the monthlies. April saw, to follow up on Colin's question, April saw a pretty big decel if you look at it on a 2-year basis, so guiding to that 2 to 3 for 2Q, how are you feeling about May? Is that within the range? Is that above the range? Any commentary there is appreciated.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: May is performing as we expected.\nOperator: And we'll go to our next question from Kate McShane with Citi Research.\nKate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wondered if you could update us a little bit more on what you're seeing in the competitive environment and if you had any commentary around the introduction of AmazonSupply?\nFrancis S. Blake: AmazonSupply? So Kate, I would say from a competitive perspective, first, no. I mean it would be really very early in the day to expect to see anything from AmazonSupply. Obviously, it's something we're very aware of and focused on, but no competitive impact from it. Across-the-board, as Craig was saying, it's always worthwhile recognizing we compete in all our different business segments across a broad range of competitors. We believe, talking to our vendors, that we're picking up share, but that's always -- just because our various markets are so different, it's always hard to track precisely.\nKate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. One of your competitors is doing a pretty extensive line review right now. And I wondered if that was having any impact at all with some of your conversations with vendors and maybe your relationship with your vendors and what you're getting into your stores?\nCraig A. Menear: I mean, again, I -- we're in constant communication with our suppliers. Our focus is on driving the business with our suppliers and we're always talking to folks in the market who we do business with and we don't do business with. So really no major change to how we're approaching things.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And you would say that growth is a great thing to deliver to our suppliers. We grew ourselves in 2011 and we started off the year pretty strong.\nOperator: And we'll go to our next question from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.\nAlan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Question on the gross margin line. Carol you mentioned that the gross margins were aided mostly from improvements in supply chain. But compared to the last few quarters, it looks like those improvements are moderating. Can you maybe give us an update on where you think future improvements from the RDC initiative are likely to come and what those benefits may be?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, sure. We were actually very pleased with our supply chain performance in the first quarter. It was better than our plan. And given the sales spikes that we had across the country, we needed to do amazing things to move products. So kudos to our supply chain team for doing such a great job and for delivering the leverage that they did deliver. A couple of other points, Alan: first, we did have some fuel headwind come our way in the first quarter that cost us about 3 basis points. So the supply chain benefit would have been 11 x fuel. And as we think about year-over-year, last year we got about 32 basis points of benefit coming off of the supply chain. This year, we'll probably get about 1/3 of that for the year and that's consistent with the plan that we laid out. And then as we look longer term, and again we've got an investor conference coming up in June, we'll show you even more benefits coming off the supply chain.\nAlan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And one follow-up, if I may. Just going back to the difference on the pro side between the larger pros and the smaller pro business, what opportunities are there for you to try to stimulate the smaller pro customer including credit?\nFrancis S. Blake: So Alan, the biggest opportunity we have with our pro customer, which is what Marvin and his team are focused on is doing a great job getting them in and out the store fast and having the product that they want in the right quantity at the right price. And that's really where we're focused and that's where Marvin's focused his team. I don't know, Marvin, if you want to -- so we're not thinking about a new program on our side on credit to try to stimulate activity.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: But we do approve 70% of all applications that we receive from our pros. The average line that we grant is about $6,600. So we will provide credit to those who qualify, and a 70% approval rate is pretty good approval rate.\nMarvin R. Ellison: Yes, and Alan, to the service point that Frank made, our Net Promoter Score for the pro segment increased 453 basis points in the quarter. It's the largest improvement in service we have in the entire store. And when you dissect that service score into components, the most improved component is the speed of checkout and how the pros feel about our price and our product. So for us, we've asked a lot of questions. We spent a lot of time with these customers, both small and large, and we asked those customers what can we do to facilitate a better environment for them. And in the service in and out fast is important. The right products at the right price is important. And as Carol mentioned, I mean we feel really good about our credit offering. So we're just very hopeful that we'll continue to do these things and that business segment will continue to improve.\nAlan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And just one quick point of clarification. Did I hear you correctly in saying that larger pros who spend $10,000 or more represent 12% of your pro base?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Yes.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: During the script, you alluded to some stress within the supply chain that you handled well over the quarter. Do you think that had the impact of restraining your sales and are you able to quantify that during the period?\nFrancis S. Blake: So Mike, I don't think we can quantify it for you. But for sure, and Craig and Mark Holifield, our Head of our Supply Chain, are here. This was a very unusual winter. And we got hit with some very unusual demands and we were really pleased at how our supply chain responded. But the reality is you're always a little bit chasing in that kind of a spiked environment.\nCraig A. Menear: Yes, we had regions of the country, Michael, where we had product categories that drove comps in excess of 50%. Certainly, our suppliers didn't plan and anticipate that, nor did we at the beginning of the season, but everybody rallied to scramble. Really hard to tell if you missed sales. I mean in most product categories, we carry a multitude of products to choose from. So whether you actually missed a sale or not is a question that's pretty hard to get your head around. But we certainly know we had opportunities within the quarter in those kind of high spiked areas.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So it's probably safe to assume that supply chain always acts as a bit of a bottleneck in such a spiky and seasonally changing business. Do you think it was any more intense given the patterns you saw during this quarter than it had been in the past, especially given the newness of the supply chain?\nCraig A. Menear: I would say actually I think the supply chain allowed us to react faster than we would have been able to before.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Absolutely.\nFrancis S. Blake: We did, as I've said, this was an interesting real stress test on a new system and we were really pleased with how it responded.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Remember, the last time we saw these kind of comps was fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. And back then, well, we didn't have much of a supply chain.\nMarvin R. Ellison: And Michael, speaking as a guy that run the store and take the calls and e-mails from the stores, when we're now performing well in any part of the business, they were very pleased. If you look at the northern parts of the country, high-volume markets, accelerated spike sales, the supply chain did -- team did yeoman's work and we were very pleased with our ability to get products to the market, in some cases, before our competition. And we feel good about that. So we think that Mark and his team deserve a ton of credit for helping us to facilitate the sales that we were able to bring to the table.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I want to switch gears just as my follow-up. In the past, the relationship between home improvement and housing has been that home improvement has tended to lag behind, at least the velocity of housing turnover. Are you seeing any evidence to suggest that the relationship may be a little different this time where home improvement may be picking up before housing? And if that's the case, could it take some wind out of the sails as the housing market recovers?\nFrancis S. Blake: So I would say, Michael, if I understand your question, the first thing I'd say is that the home improvement, the repair/remodel business has obviously been more stable than the housing market, particularly the new home build. And so you're seeing some more elevated growth compared to home building. If -- I'm not sure I -- the second part of your question, which is could that\u2026\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So if consumers are feeling better about that, the sentiment has improved and that would normally occur, or at least in the past it would have occurred concurrent with housing lift in either prices or the velocity of turnover, and now it seems like sentiment's improving actually faster than the fundamentals of the underlying housing markets, that maybe home improvement is getting a little bit more of a lift ahead of time that will take some of the benefit, I guess, essentially pulling it forward.\nFrancis S. Blake: Okay. Well, so here's how I answer that and again we'll see how it responds, so this is kind of new territory for all of us. But I'd say the important thing to look at is both on housing, existing home turnover and on repair/remodel activity, just think about the number of mortgages that are underwater. So you've got almost 1/4 of the people who own mortgages that are underwater. That's both stressful on a turnover. That kind of puts a bit of a break on existing home turnover and it's stressful on repair and remodel activity. You do some basic repair activity, but you're less inclined to do large remodels when you're underwater. And we'll talk about this more in the -- in our upcoming conference, but I'd say what you'd hope to see is pricing improving, credit availability improving and a lift across both segments. So if I understood the kind of basis of your question, which is would home improvement repair/remodel actually kind of decelerate into the improving housing picture, we don't think that's how it will play out.\nMichael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, so there still could be good days ahead.\nFrancis S. Blake: We certainly think so.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Yes, we think.\nOperator: And we'll go to our next question from Greg Melich from ISI.\nGregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Want to follow up on an earlier question and I have one on inventory and cash flow. The follow-up is the ticket, which was up 2.2% in the quarter, it sounded like a lot of that was driven by seasonal projects and also these large contractors. So does that mean as we decelerate in the second quarter, it'll be more ticket you think? Or you think it's really traffic that's driving that deceleration?\nCraig A. Menear: So if we look at ticket above $900, the big drivers in this quarter for that were riding lawn equipment, we had a solid quarter in appliances, and then interestingly, the in-stock kitchen business, which largely focuses on our pro customer.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: And Greg, we had 329 million transactions in the first quarter. That's the highest in our company history, so we would think that would start to slow down as we move into the second quarter.\nGregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So basically, it sounds like both are going to slow when you see it in 2Q? And then on the cash flow, inventory was down but payables were up 9% and your cash balance ended up over $3 billion, which is very heavy. I guess if I take your guidance, I get your leverage moving down around 1.8x debt-to-EBITDAR by the end of the year. Would you go to the debt markets to try and keep that at 2 or are you sort of happy with it being at 1.8x if that's where it ends up? Just give us some thoughts on the working capital and the leverage.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Sure. Well, first on the working capital side, the payables ratio is really a reflection of how weak sales were in April of 2011. As you recall, we had a negative comp in April, our purchases were down. We had positive comp this year, so it's just a timing matter year-on-year. We are about $500 million ahead of our cash plan, but that's because of stock options that were exercised in the first quarter that we hadn't planned on. Our stock hit a 10-year high, many of our optionees elected to exercise their options, and we got some cash in. As we think about then what do we do with the cash and what do we do with our capital structure, I don't mean to kick the can down the road, but I'm going to kick it to our June conference at which time we'll give you more color about any additional share repurchases we might do in 2012 as well as a longer-term perspective on share repurchases, debt, capital raising, et cetera.\nGregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And I guess just lastly, do you think the inventory now is at the right level, or are we still a little light given how strong the quarter was?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Well, if you look at inventory, down $100 million year-on-year. On a per-store basis, down a little over 1%. The majority of the per-store decline as of the end of the quarter was in Canada. And last year, our Canadian inventories were bloated, in all candor. So we feel good about where inventory is.\nCraig A. Menear: The other piece of the inventory, Greg, is with the investments we made in our DCF and our [ph] programs, we've actually been able to leverage our inventory investment in our DCs while maintaining good position overall. So we feel good about that as well.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Two questions, and the first revolves around some of the merchandising efforts. Obviously, you've been working on building localization, regionalization of inventory. Can help us understand how that might have impacted your in-stock and it might have benefited margin above and beyond the direct supply chain benefits?\nCraig A. Menear: Well, Matt, you're right. We've been working hard to make sure that we are adjusting our assortments to the local markets and the demographics in those markets. We certainly think that, that is part of what has helped us drive the overall business and deliver the comp performance not only in this quarter, but kind of where we've been for the past few quarters. And certainly, when you get the product in the right location, you then benefit from -- particularly if they're in seasonal businesses, you don't have the same liquidation expense that you might have like we did a few years back when we weren't leveraging or didn't have the capability or the tools that we have. So certainly, having the right product in the right place benefits you in terms of the ability and the amount that you sell at full price.\nMarvin R. Ellison: Matt, this is Marvin. I don't think we can overstate the importance of product coming from receiving to the sales floor versus in the overhead. Mark Holifield and his team and the supply chain, along with Marc Powers and the operations team, have really done a good job of partnering on the whole receiving and freight movement process. I mean if you follow The Home Depot for a while and just take a look at the overheads in our stores versus years past and what you'll see is a product where it needs to be and that's on the floor where we can sell it, our payroll is a lot more productive and we don't need to carry as much safety stock because of the supply chain improvements. So I think you take what Craig said, you think about the efficiencies on the supply chain and in the receiving and in-stock process and that's benefiting us as well.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And is there any way to quantify that year-on-year or just we know that it helped?\nMarvin R. Ellison: It's pretty tough to actually put a number to it.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then on the numbers, this is maybe a bit of an academic exercise since we have a sense of where Q2 is tracking. But within the first quarter, the cadence obviously was driven by better weather in part for the first couple of months and then you had this, presumably a lot of pull-forward within the quarter and then this very subdued compare given the rain a year ago. Any sense of how much February and March pull-forward from April just as we do look at the monthly multiyear trends?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: We didn't do that regression. We should have, but we didn't do that.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then finally, Carol, you spoke at the outset of the year about your anticipation for comp cadence over the year as a whole. Clearly, I guess the first quarter probably, at least in your outlook, is a high watermark. But any update as we think about the ensuing quarters and what kind of cadence you might anticipate as part of the guidance?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Sure. So because of the pull-forward, the second quarter comp should be lower than the first quarter. The comp for the first half should be higher than the back half. Not a big difference between the halves, but clearly first half will be stronger than the back half.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And the second quarter versus the rest of the year, if I could try to parse it that finally?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: I would say the second quarter would be the lowest comping quarter of the year.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Despite the fourth quarter compare?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Despite the fourth quarter compare. Because as you know, every year we tend to outperform the previous year since Craig and the merchants and the operators are doing a masterful job of growing our seasonal business. This is a business that we are very low penetrated in that we continue to show year-on-year growth.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Scott Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: You guys have been pretty adamant for quite a while that there isn't a recovery in the housing market and that you expect to fluctuate with GDP. But you have been comping in the 4 to 6 range the last few -- last 4 quarters and I understand the weather's helped the last 2. But I guess the question is if we were to get a housing recovery, what kind of comps do you think you guys could generate on, let's call it a multi-year basis?\nFrancis S. Blake: So Scott, first, it's not -- I don't want to misinterpret it as saying that there is no housing recovery. I think the housing market is definitely better. The question for us is, is it better enough to kind of push us off the general GDP growth connection that we've been seeing for the last couple of years? And we go, yes, it's better, but it's not yet that much better. When we get together in June, hopefully we can lay out for you a little more clearly how we think our business improves depending on your point of view on the degree of the housing market recovery, strong recovery when it occurs, and whether it's a strong recovery or just kind of a very gradual fall.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's fair. And then just curious in terms of mix. I don't know if you have mentioned this or not. But with a stronger sales of outdoor products because of the weather, was there a negative impact on the gross margin from mix at all?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Yes, as we said, the gross margin x supply chain was flat year-on-year and that really was a mix story. Craig, maybe want to give...\nCraig A. Menear: Yes, I mean categories like power -- outdoor power equipment, dirt, mulch, all those carry lower-than-average margins, so it certainly had a mix impact.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: You may recall last year, Scott, we had 14 basis points of gross margin benefit in the first quarter from mix because we had a lower penetration of seasonal category spend.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So Frank, you'd said that Florida and California continue to recover. Can you quantify that relative to last quarter where I think you said Florida was ahead of the comp average and California was about in line?\nFrancis S. Blake: Right, and this quarter as you might expect given just the weather impact, Florida and California were below the company average.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, and so then I guess therefore...\nFrancis S. Blake: But still -- but that's still good -- I mean, it's a good recovery, still a positive and a good recovery.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Sure, okay. And then you said 38 out of 40 regions were positive. So 2 were negative. Surprised that any were negative. Can you just tell us what areas were negative?\nFrancis S. Blake: So 38 out of our top 40 markets, not -- I mean we don't have 40 regions. The negative ones were, for what it's worth, it was Phoenix and then we also were negative in New Orleans, and there are some very specific conditions in both of those markets that explain that.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: Particularly the year-over-year comparisons. Last year in the first quarter, those 2 markets were some of our strongest-performing markets.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, okay. Yes, I was just more curious than anything. And then one last question, the commentary that you talked about, the large pro versus small pro, I don't think you've talked about that before. So I'm just wondering why you called it out now. Is it a change in trend that you're seeing? Is that sort of dynamic where the large is doing so much better than the small pro? Is that something you've seen consistently or did that really just sort of pop up early this year?\nFrancis S. Blake: No, so I'll tell you why we called it out in part. First off, because I do think it's an interesting way of thinking about our business and thinking -- for us, it's a tool for thinking about the recovery of the business because we've been talking to everyone for quite a while about how our pro and consumer businesses, how they're differentially faring. And the second thing was, as Craig said and for those of you who followed us for a while, you know we've been sort of on a journey to build in some of this consumer insight capability. We had, had it outsourced and then we brought it in-house and it's taken a while for us to get comfortable with the tools, get the data together. And so we were kind of giving you a here's what those tools are showing us, here's what we think the implications are.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, so it's not necessarily it's just that you're starting to look at it now, but it's not necessarily that the large pro's all of a sudden gotten a lot better than the small pro or anything like that?\nFrancis S. Blake: No. I would say as we called out, that we saw some good-sized growth on those large pros, which is encouraging. As I said, you can have a theory of the case on how the pro market as a whole will thaw and we'll be giving periodic updates, I'm sure, on how that hypothesis is playing out.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Peter Benedict from Robert Baird.\nPeter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: A few quarters ago, there was a lot of concern in the market about the potential uptick in promotional activity across the space. Can you talk about how the promotional tone was during the quarter and how it was versus your expectations?\nCraig A. Menear: Yes, I mean, to be honest with you, we didn't see any major shift in promotional activity during the quarter at all.\nPeter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: All right, perfect. And then some regional color on this pro recovery trend, not to beat a dead horse here, but particularly those larger pros. Are there any markets, in particular, where that recovery by the larger pro is particularly strong?\nMarvin R. Ellison: Peter, this is Marvin. It's no coincidence that the north and the northeast was very strong, really due to the ability of pros to get out and do jobs they typically would not be able to do this time of the year.\nOperator: Our last question comes from David Strasser from Janney Capital Markets.\nDavid S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I'm going to change the topic a little bit. Can I talk a little bit about online and private label? Two things I've noticed a lot of recently is it just seems you've been really expanding online as you've talked about a lot, particularly into the seasonal patio furniture. I was just curious how that's gone and sort of this home decorator concept that you've had. I think it's direct -- I think it's through Groupon and I don't know if it's exclusive with Groupon. And then I guess the last question, somewhat related is HDX, I'm seeing that brand pop up a lot in stores, so I'm just sort of curious, what -- as you think about that, it seems to be a somewhat rather diverse group of product offerings in that and how you're thinking about that. So I guess 3 somewhat different questions, but I hope you can at least answer 2 of them.\nCraig A. Menear: So let me start with the online. As you know, we've been investing in our online business. We put new Webster 7 in place to enhance our capabilities, improve the speed, which is important obviously for our customers. We're very pleased with how that business is going. We're seeing both sales growth that obviously exceeds the company. And we're seeing traffic growth in that space. And so it's an area of the business that's important to us. It's still a little around 2% of the business in total. We've seen some nice external recognition of the work that we've done as well in terms of the ForeSee E-Retail Satisfaction Index. We got above 79, which is a new place for us, which is a very positive result and recognized as the most improved since that index began at over 10 points. So we're pleased with where that space is going, and overall, how it's helping us to satisfy the customers' needs to be able to shop when, where and how they want. As it relates to the private label business, we've talked quite openly with our supply base in terms of when and why we'll go after a private label program. We are expanding the opportunity that we have to continue to drive value for our customer and be able to deliver strong value propositions as well as support the overarching strategy that we have in place to compete in all channels. So you'll see us, we'll talk more about that at our investor conference. But that is an element of the business that we're focused on as part of our portfolio strategy.\nDavid S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Just one follow-up, and kind of once again the 2 of them related. As you look at sort a lot more free shipping and you're offering it even on some patio furniture over, I think, $399. The impact to that on gross margin and then sort of, I guess, the positive impacts on sort of the HDX, is that even big enough to have any impact on all today?\nCraig A. Menear: I mean we do look at the business in total in terms of how we look at both sales and the contribution margin, both in-store and online and how those businesses come together. So that is something that we're focused on.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9: But your point about size is the right point. Today, our dot-com sales is about 2% of our total sales.\nDiane S. Dayhoff: Well, thank you to everyone who has joined us this quarter, and we look forward to talking to you either at our Investor Conference on June 6 or at next quarter's earnings.\nOperator: That concludes our call for today.

Now, let me turn the call over to Frank Blake. \nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane and good morning everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $17.7 billion, down 3% from last year. This year\u2019s fourth quarter consisted of 13 weeks compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter which had 14 weeks. Excluding that additional week in 2012, sales for the fourth quarter were up 3.9% from the prior year. Comp sales were positive 4.4% and our diluted earnings per share were $0.73. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 4.9%. From a geographic perspective, 17 of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps. The two regions with negative comps were New York and New Jersey, both of which were overlapping last year\u2019s strong repair sales from Hurricane Sandy. Counterbalancing that we had positive comp performance throughout our western and southern divisions and even with the pressure from New York and New Jersey, our northern division positively comped. We grew ticket and comp transactions in the quarter, improved inventory turns and maintained our focus on expense control. Our pro customer had another quarter of sales growth. Adjusting for hurricane impacts, the pro and consumer grew at the same rate in the quarter. Marvin and the operations team continue to focus on improving the experience for our pros. We launched our Pro Xtra program this past fall. With Pro Xtra, our pros contract their purchases, take advantage of exclusive product offers and get access to helpful business tools. The rate of sign-ups has increased and is over 10,000 per week and we will be introducing new functionalities for our pros throughout 2014. In merchandising as Craig will detail, we are pleased with the results of our Black Friday Holiday and Gift Center events during the quarter. We saw strong growth on interconnected retail with dot com sales growing approximately 50% for the quarter on a 13 week basis. Our online customer satisfaction scores improved as we continued to enhance the experience across our full site, mobile and tablet and we\u2019re seeing accelerated improvement in our conversion rates. To support our interconnected retail efforts we recently opened our first of three new direct fulfillment centers. Each facility will have capacity to hold as many as 100,000 SKUs for direct ship to customers. We already have the convenience of 2000 locations throughout the country for buying online and returning or picking up instore. These facilities will now expand our capabilities to ship most orders the same day they are received. As another part of our interconnected efforts last month we acquired Blinds.com. We\u2019re very excited about this acquisition, Blinds.com is the market leader in online window coverings with a compelling, shopping, sales and service experience for customers. In addition to the strength we believe they will bring to us in this category, we also believe they can help us develop best in class capabilities for selling customized, configurable products online. And most importantly their entrepreneurial culture is a great fit with the Home Depot culture. On the International front in local currency our Canadian business had positive comps above the Company average. And just last week we opened the first of our two new Canadian rapid deployment centers. Our Mexican business positively comped for the quarter making it 41 quarters in a row of positive comp growth. Looking at the full year 2013 we significantly exceeded our plan. On a 52 week basis we grew sales by over $5 billion. We had the most transactions in the company history and our best annual comp sales increased since 1999. And looking at our two year stacked comp rates we had very consistent double digit sales increases in every quarter. The company with the help of our vendors was able to respond effectively to this increased demand while maintaining tight operational focus. For 2014 as Carol will detail we expect sales growth of 4.8% and diluted earnings per share of $4.38, a 16.5% increase. 2014 GDP estimates call for low single-digit growth so our 2014 guidance is premised on the housing market as a continuing tailwind for our business. It is not our view that all housing metrics will sustain the growth rates from 2013 going forward. This last year saw a particularly strong recovery in housing prices but we do expect the housing recovery to continue, expect that home prices will increase even though at a lower rate and expect that affordability will support growth in the home improvement market. Year-over-year private fixed residential investment or PFRI, as a percentage of GDP grew to 3.1% in the fourth quarter. This remains well below the 60 year average of approximately 4.6%. Finally today our Board announced a 21% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share. This is the 5th dividend increase in as many years and follows our targeted dividend payout of 50% of earnings. We remain committed to discipline capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. We will invest to sustain and grow our business, our intent is to increase our dividend every year and we will use our excess cash for share repurchases. Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication. I would like to give special thanks to all of our associates who have helped their customers and their communities through the recent winter storms often under the most difficult of circumstances. It's a great reflection of everyone everyone\u2019s hard work that this have 100% of our stores qualify for success sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. We set a record for success sharing payout for the full year of 2013 almost a quarter of a $1 billion. We\u2019re proud of that result and look forward to continuing this momentum in 2014. With that let me turn the call over to Craig. \nCraig Menear: Thanks Frank. Good morning everyone. We\u2019re pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, although the makeup of sales was very different by area of the country [ph]. The departments that outperformed the company\u2019s average comp for the fourth quarter were indoor garden, kitchens, outdoor garden, plumbing, electrical and tools. Bath hardware, paint, d\u00e9cor, lighting, flooring, millwork and lumber performed positively. Comp sales in building materials were negative reflecting tough year-over-year strong comparisons in booking [ph]. Sales for the quarter were driven by great events, including our outstanding Black Friday and strong guest centers and flexible response in seasonal categories, including winter preparedness and decorative holiday. As Frank mentioned, weather had some impact to our sales as we anniversary-ed last year\u2019s Hurricane Sandy sales and the fourth quarter this year saw severe winter storms in some of the coolest temperatures on record in the Midwest and Northeast. As a result, our northern division experienced negative comps in outdoor project categories like lumber and building materials. This negative impact was partially offset by positive performance in weather-related categories like portable heating, pumps, weather stripping and snow removal equipment. In areas of the country that were not affected by difficult weather, we saw continued strength across the store. Across the country including our northern division, maintenance and repair categories like pipe and fittings, air circulation, cleaning and HVAC had comps above the company average. We also saw continued strength in light bulbs, where sales posted a double-digit positive comp for the fourth consecutive quarter. Continued innovation in LED technology is becoming more widely adopted by our customers and is expanding to other categories of the store like decorative and security light. Categories that are traditionally dominated by our pro customers also performed well. For example, dimensional lumber, insulation, concrete, pneumatic fasteners comped above the company average. As I shared with you last quarter, we executed several events planned to drive sales. In decorative holiday, several new products were introduced, including our expanded assortment of pre-lit trees. While the holiday selling season was compressed by one less week compared to 2012, we drove positive comps in these categories, including our online channel. Thanks to our amazing values and execution by our associates, we had one of our best sell-through rates ever. Black Friday sales were the highest on record and gift center sales exceeded our plan. Outstanding exclusive offers driven with our vendor partners allowed us to be first to market with product and resulted in great performance in part to accessories and tools and portable power. Total comp transactions grew by 3.3% for the quarter, while average ticket increased 1.1%. The total impact of ticket growth from commodity inflation was flat. Transactions per ticket under $50 representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 2.5% for the fourth quarter. Transactions per tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 5.5% in the fourth quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were appliances and the continued recovery of our pro customer. Now, let me turn our attention to the first quarter. We are excited about the opportunities we have as we entered into our spring selling season. Our new assortment planning tools provides us the ability to optimize our assortments at a local level and help us better prepare for spring. As many of you know, spring is our biggest selling season. So for the fifth consecutive year, we will have our spring Black Friday event. Working with our vendors, we plan to bring in special buyers and extraordinary values on popular spring items like patio furniture, grills, landscape and live goods to name a few. In addition to this, we are also excited about the new products our merchants have added to our assortments. In outdoor living, we are introducing higher end patio furniture from Brown Jordan, that is available online and showcased in some of our stores. This exciting new product allows customers to customize the furniture and fabric to fit their space with fabric options from Sunbrella. We are also adding five new collections to our core patio, which will expand our assortments and offer our customers more options than they have ever had. In grills, Weber\u2019s new exclusive Spirit Series with the Gourmet Barbecue System offers our customers several attachments to enhance the barbecuing experience. And we are also expanding the new brands with the addition of charcoal and gas grills from KitchenAid. New for 2014 in outdoor power is a full line up of cordless power from Eagle, including lawn mowers, string trimmer, blower and hedge trimmer. These tools are powered by a 56 volt Lithium-Ion Battery with 40% more power compared to other batteries in the industry and a remarkable recharging time that allows a dead battery to be fully charged in as a little as 30 minutes. While we\u2019re loaded for the outdoor spring selling season we also have a strong lineup of product for projects inside the home. New for bath, Delta\u2019s ActivTouch H20 hand shower combines a quick [ph] showerhead and hand shower with 9 spray settings and the ease of ActivTouch technology which allows for one hand operation. Also for bath through an exclusive partnership with Polar [ph] we\u2019re introducing a new line up of bathing productions including the toilet seat with an integrated LED light. And for our pro customers we\u2019re introducing a new line of water heaters from Rheem with innovative features and improved diagnostic controls. These water heaters decrease energy usage by 10% as compared to current models and increase available hot water by up to 25% saving both time and money. In addition these models, many of these models already meet the 2015 Department of Energy specifications a whole year in advance and are exclusive to the Home Depot. Heading into 2015 spring selling season, we believe that we\u2019re well-positioned and are excited about the opportunities that it brings. And with that I like to turn the call over to \nCarol Tome: Thank you Craig. Good morning. In the fourth quarter sales were $17.7 billion. As Frank mentioned fiscal 2012 included a 53rd week which added approximately $1.2 billion in sales to the fourth quarter and the year. The extra week is not included in our 2013 comp or same store sales calculation. Comp sales were positive 4.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.7% in November, 6.9% in December and 3% in January. Comp sales for U.S. stores were positive 4.9% for the quarter. With positive comps of 3.7% in November, 7.8% in December and 3.8% in January. For the year our sales increased 5.4% to $78.8 billion. Excluding sales from the 53rd week in fiscal 2012 total sales for fiscal 2013 increased 5.2%. For the year total company comp sales were positive 6.8% and comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.5%. Our total company gross margin was 35% for the fourth quarter considerably better than our plan and was 10 basis points higher than last year of which 14 basis points came from our U.S. business. The year-over-year expansion in our U.S. business can be explained by the following. First, we experienced 6 basis points of gross margin expansion due to productivity within our supply chain. The remaining 8 basis points of expansion reflects the net impact of a change in the mix of products sold and in some cases higher co-op and rebate levels than last year as we reached higher purchase tiers. For the year we experienced 18 basis points of gross margin expansion. Operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 26 basis points to 25% in the fourth quarter. Excluding last year\u2019s extra week operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased 554 basis points. Fiscal 2013 operating expense as a percent of sales was 23.1% a decrease of 106 basis points from what we reported last year. On a 52 week basis our expenses grew at 32% of our sales growth rate in-line with our guidance. In the fourth quarter interest and other expense was $178 million an increase of $80 million from last year and for the year interest and other expense totaled $699 million, an increase of $154 million from the prior year. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to $4 billion of incremental debt issued in fiscal 2013. Our income tax provision rate was 36% in the fourth quarter and 36.4% for the year. On a reported basis diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.73 an increase of 7.4% from last year. On a 13-week basis, diluted earnings per share grew by 19.7%. For the year on a reported basis, diluted earnings per share were $3.76, an increase of 25.3% compared to the prior year. On a 52-week basis, diluted earnings per share grew by 28.3%. One last comment on the earnings per share, you will recall that in fiscal 2012, we incurred a $145 million non-recurring charge related to the closing of our China stores, which had a $0.10 negative impact to fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share. We have provided a supplementary schedule in our press release that sets forth a year-over-year comparison with and without this charge. Now, moving to our operational metrics. During the fourth quarter, we opened three new stores in Mexico and one in the U.S. and ended the year with 2,263 stores. At the end of the year, selling square footage was $236 million, about flat to last year and sales per square foot increased 4.9% to $334. At the end of the year, inventory was $11 billion, up $347 million from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.6 times, up from 4.5 times last year. Moving on to our share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we received 3.4 million shares related to the true-up of an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR program, we initiated in the third quarter. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion or 26.4 million shares. This included 7.5 million shares repurchased on the open-market and 18.9 million shares repurchased through an ASR program that was initiated and closed in the fourth quarter. For the year, we repurchased a total of $8.5 billion, 111.3 million shares of outstanding stock. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 20.9%, 390 basis points higher than at the end of fiscal 2012. We detailed our 2014 guidance in our press release, but I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP, so fiscal 2014 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2013. As we look to 2014, we are basing our sales growth assumptions starting with GDP growth forecast, which for the U.S. are approximately 2.8%. We are also projecting that the U.S. housing market, namely home price appreciation household formation and housing turnover will contribute approximately 200 basis points of comp growth in 2014. While some of the macro and housing data has softened over the last few months, we continued to believe that we are in the moderate stage of housing recovery. As Frank mentioned, home affordability is still quite attractive and we are continuing to see home prices improve, both of which are positive for our business. For the year, we expect comp sales growth of approximately 4.6% and total sales growth of approximately 4.8%. Some may see this as slightly lower than the preliminary 2014 guidance we gave in December of 2013. While nothing has materially changed in our economic outlook, we did adjust our 2014 plan to reflect a weaker Canadian dollar than what we experienced last year. I will also note that the extreme winter weather in February hasn\u2019t been our friend, but our February comps are positive and we know firsthand that many homeowners have some major repairs ahead of them, which suggest we should have a great spring selling season. For 2014, we are projecting no gross margin expansions consistent with our intent to use cost out savings to support recovering and growing lower margin product categories. On the expense front, we are forecasting our expenses to grow at approximately 33% at the rate of our sales growth. For the year, we project that our operating margin will grow by approximately 70 basis points and we expect diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 16.5% to $4.38. Our earnings per share guidance includes our plan to repurchase approximately $5 billion of outstanding shares during the year using excess cash. Our 2014 capital spending plan is approximately $1.5 billion, an 8% increase from what we spent in fiscal 2013 in support of interconnected retail. For the year, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $8.8 billion. We will use our cash to invest in our business and to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Our commitment to shareholder returns continues to be a hallmark of the Home Depot, on top of our intense repurchase $5 billion of outstanding shares in 2014. As Frank mentioned we just announced a 21% increase in our quarterly dividend which equates to an annual dividend of $1.88 in-line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50%. So we thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call and Lisa we\u2019re now ready for questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Aram Rubinson from Wolfe Research. \nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: I wanted to ask you a question about growth kind of beyond recovery, a lot of companies in cyclical businesses is turned to acquisitions when economy growth moderates. Wondering if you can tell us a little bit about your appetite for acquisitions as it is today and also as you look at few years out in the economy moderates a little bit, how you think that might develop? \nFrank Blake: I will let Carol comment on this as well but I would say what you see from us now and what I would expect to continue is that we use acquisitions really not as a supplement to sales growth but as a supplement to competences that we think are important to add to our capabilities and I would anticipate that that would be the case going forward. \nCarol Tome: Yes indeed Aram we have got a filter that looks at opportunities for growth through acquisitions just in that light, how can they enable our existing business. So if you look at Blinds.com the most recent acquisition that we made are not only are we getting a terrific online configurator one that\u2019s much better than what we have we\u2019re also getting a another [ph] call center and these people know how to close sales. This is enabling business of ours that we think has huge growth potential. \nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: And so growth won't become let\u2019s say post recovery from acquisitions, would we be kind of banking more on share repurchase, more on added leverage or is there some other innovation that you would hope, point us to and think about what it might look like five years from now. Thank you. \nFrank Blake: So Aram we constantly think also about taking share and expanding categories in our store and improving the productivity of our store and we have actually been through quite a long period of not having growth in our market and we have some experience of being able to generate positive comp growth even in the flat to down housing market. 2010, 2011 were not friendly years in the housing market and we were positively confident. \nOperator: And we will go next to Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Wondering if you can speak a little bit to your terming the recovery now in the moderate space, did you look through the last three months or the last six months? What you\u2019re seeing different in terms of consumer demand and appetite either around categories or price points or in the area of discretionary remodel. But how you\u2019re seeing that evolve and if anything has changed in the last three months relative to the prior three months in terms of the intensity or the areas for demand (indiscernible). \nFrank Blake: So Eric again let Carol comment on some of the macro things that we\u2019re seeing but I would also just prefix this by saying it's difficult to tease those conclusions out from a quarter where you\u2019ve a lot of particularly unusual weather and some unusual overlaps for us. So as Carol mentioned in her comments we do see housing as a tailwind but not perhaps quite as much as it was in 2013 but again if you look just at the last quarter hard to tease out some of the specifics on that. \nCarol Tome: As we look at the macro we think housing will be a contributor to our growth next year, we\u2019re about 200 basis points. We think it contributed about 250 basis points in 2013. Biggest driver is home price appreciation. And in last years, home prices were up double-digit, we are not forecasting that. In 2014, we think they will be up around 6%. Now, home prices have 21% to go before they return to peak some preference to conservative outlook, but we think it\u2019s a realistic outlook to build a plan on. One comment I might say about the consumer and Craig maybe you want to jump in on this is that as we look at sales against opening price points of good, better, best, all the way to premium, we have seen growth in premium priced products in all four quarters including this last quarter. So it doesn\u2019t really seem to us I think a change in the consumer, I mean, there (indiscernible) of other disruptions for sure, but it doesn\u2019t really seem like there is a change in the consumer. \nCraig Menear: No, not at all. And as Carol mentioned, we are seeing to grow opportunity going up the line structure. And I think the other comment would be that over the past few quarters we have shared that our pro-business has been recovering. So you are seeing growth across categories like lumber and building materials that historically during the downturn weren\u2019t as strong. \nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Perfect. Thank you very much. \nFrank Blake: Thanks, Eric. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. \nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Hi, good morning. I guess first question you noted that areas not impacted by weather, which I guess were few in far between saw continued strength, can you maybe just put the numbers behind that or maybe if you look out west where snow weather is much (indiscernible)? \nFrank Blake: So Dennis, the Western division was our strongest performing division and that was the least impacted by weather. \nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: And I guess when you say maintaining the strength, is it fair to say comps were comparable than to the prior quarter? \nCarol Tome: In the Western division, I would say that our comps were about the twice the company average. \nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Carol, I think you mentioned that gross margins were well above plan, you kind of went through the levers there versus a year ago, but relative to plan where would be upside driven and how does that kind of factor into the flat outlook for \u201814? \nCarol Tome: Sure. Well, you remember that we were anniversary-ing strong sales from Hurricane Sandy. We had about $235 million of sales that we had anniversary-ied. Nonetheless, we built a plan that had our building materials department growing year-on-year. And as Craig pointed out, it didn\u2019t grow year-on-year. And that\u2019s a good news from a margin perspective, because we had a benefit from a lower penetration of a lower margin category. So that was one big change. The other change is the purchasing peers that we hit in certain categories and this is just a function of demand. So we had new purchasing tiers for refrigeration, installation, plumbing repair, we hadn\u2019t planned on that and that gave us higher co-op and rebate. \nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Okay, perfect. Thank you. Best of luck. \nCarol Tome: Thank you. \nFrank Blake: Thank you. \nOperator: And we will go next to Kate McShane from Citi. \nKate McShane - Citi: Thank you. I am hoping to follow-up on question asked previously with regards to the housing market trends, Carol, you always expressed your thoughts on changes in the environment, and I wondered if you could add your perspective on any opportunity for the easing of plumbing work or the lowering of FICO scores and how that might play into your guidance? \nCarol Tome: Yes. We thought all along that credit availability was the big driver of the housing recovery and the shape of the recovery curve. We are very encouraged by what we have seen at Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo has announced that they are taking the FICO scores for FHA loans, down from what was 640 to now 600. We think that will be very good particularly for those new households who are buying their first home, that also is a good new story when you think about the affordability curve, because if you look at an affordability zone, mortgages that are $100,000 mortgage and this would be a great mortgage for an FHA loan that stays in the affordability zone until mortgage rates reach 9%. So we are encouraged by this. So we also hear that other lenders are starting to discuss loosening up, it\u2019s still a very tight environment, make no mistake, but there are encouraging signs. \nKate McShane - Citi: Okay, thank you. And if I could just quickly follow-up about the sales from the expected region by weather, how much do you think will be pushed into Q1 and how much do you think is just lost at this point? \nFrank Blake: Really, we don\u2019t see any loss at this stage of the game. It\u2019s very, very early obviously in the quarter and we are experiencing what maybe many ways of sales a more typical winter\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets: Carol I know you\u2019ve mentioned about a number of macro factors but are there certain factors you\u2019re particularly concerned about now and then I guess for both Frank and Carol when you guys kind of talk about PFRI as a percentage of GDP call it 3.1 today the long term average of 4.6% is it realistic to get back to 4.6% or what is the more, what do you think is the realistic target to kind of reach overtime given the current environment and current size of GDP? \nFrank Blake: So Scot on the factors that we are concerned about Carol just went through a discussion on one of them that has been a long standing concern which is credit availability and indicated we\u2019re starting to see some improvement there but that\u2019s certainly been a key factor that we have watched in terms of the recovery of PFRI and whether it gets back to 4.6% that\u2019s economist would tell you things have the tendency to revert to the mean but there are always exceptions to the rule. It will take us a while that\u2019s exactly right. \nCarol Tome: The other thing I would just point out Scot that we\u2019re looking at is household information, (indiscernible) was pretty weak but when you think about whether was it so weak and goes back to credit availability. So we need to get those millennial into a home and again really happy with what we\u2019re seeing at Wells Fargo. \nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets: So basically credit is kind of what you\u2019re looking at driving all the other data whether it's turnover, housing prices, et cetera, you think that\u2019s going to be the major let\u2019s call it Delta in that equation. \nFrank Blake: That Scot plus the economy, I mean the underlying engine remains job growth, we need people to be getting jobs. We need GDP growing and then we have absorbed and more than absorbed I mean there is no overcapacity in the housing market. We\u2019re actually down to a very, very low inventory level. So it really does come back if you have got the job growth, if you have got GDP growth then the other key factor to watch is the credit availability. \nOperator: And we will go next to Laura Champine from Canaccord Genuity. \nLaura Champine - Canaccord Genuity: Could you comment on your market share trends in the quarter? \nFrank Blake: Yes so if you look at a rolling \u201912 basis we were up roughly 35 basis points to 26.5% based on the NYSE data and when we look at third party data that tracks consumer only spending we were up in roughly 10 out of 22 key classes or departments if you will. So 10 departments 22 classes. So we feel good about the fact that we\u2019re continuing to grow share. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham - Wedbush Securities: First question is around share gains as well, can you help us understand what\u2019s happening with appliances, how much share are you getting appliances as clear relative to recent quarters? \nFrank Blake: When we look at the most recent quarter it shows based on again third party tracking that we have picked up about a 180 basis points of share in the quarter and that compares to about a 170 basis points on a rolling 12 which would be over the four quarters obviously. \nCarol Tome: Appliances contributed about 60 basis points of our comp growth in the quarter. \nSeth Basham - Wedbush Securities: And then secondly if I may follow-up regarding the macro if you think about credit availability being relatively tight and you look at some metrics like DTI, debt to income and LTD ratios, are those something tied to norms in the past. So how do you rectify that against other dimensions of credit availability? \nCarol Tome: Seth if you work for a financial institution and you took billions of dollars of losses you\u2019re in an interest rate environment that is so low it's hard to make a book. I mean it is going to be shy and you\u2019re going to very cautious in terms of underwriting. I would imagine and this is like financial institutions will tell us. So while there is, it's a better environment to lend into and I suspect that\u2019s why banks are starting to signal that they are willing to change and that\u2019s a tough road for those folks. \nOperator: And we will go next to Jaime Katz from Morningstar. \nJaime Katz - Morningstar: Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Can you guys comment just on how on the next Canadian businesses have been doing, add a little bit more color? And then maybe talk about how you guys are planning on marketing to the pro business this year to grow that business little faster? \nFrank Blake: Okay. Jaime, on the Canadian and Mexican business, first comment on Mexico, as I said, Mexico has now had 41 quarters in a row of positive comp growth. This year that performance, I mean, we say that and we sort of don\u2019t spend a lot of time dwelling on that, but this year that performance was really pretty extraordinary in the context of what was happening in the Mexican economy, which went through a significant adjustment and a significant adjustment that was centered very much around changes in housing policy. So we are very pleased with how our business not only has historically performed, but performed this year again positively comping in a difficult environment. Then on Canada, Canada adjusting for FX had a stronger comp growth in the fourth quarter than the company average. Again, we are very pleased with how our Canadian business is doing. We feel like we are well-positioned in that competitive environment and that\u2019s been positively comping really for the last several quarters in a row there. \nJaime Katz - Morningstar: And marketing to the pro? \nFrank Blake: Yes. \nCraig Menear: From a pro perspective, Frank mentioned our program we launched Pro Xtra, which we are excited about, we are signing up 10,000 customers per week and so great momentum there. And also we are pleased with our mobile app in pro just allowing us to really help our pros run a better business, leverage some of our online tools and connect our pro both virtually and in our brick-and-mortar locations. So in addition to that, we are going to continue to be aggressive on conventional means of advertising like radio, which really resonates well with our pros, but at the end of the day for pros, it\u2019s about a couple of fundamental things and that is convenience, our great service they get in and out fast and value, and we are going to focus on those three things as well. \nJaime Katz - Morningstar: Thank you. Nice quarter. \nFrank Blake: Thank you. \nCarol Tome: Thank you. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Greg Melich from ISI Group. \nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Hi, thanks. Two questions. One was just on the comp trend through the quarter and into this quarter, I was surprised just how strong December was given how strong it was a year ago, could you explain what that was and the impact of Sandy and it looks like January was the weakest month of the quarter, how much of that was weather and what do you expect those trends are how they looking into February? \nFrank Blake: As it relates to December, let me address that first, we had, as I mentioned in my comments, we had a record setting Black Friday. We had great gift center sales that exceeded our plans. Events were a strong part of December sales overall. And we had a terrific season as it related to our decorative holiday and wild trees. And so we are very, very pleased with the performance and the programs that our merchants put together and while our stores took that and drove and our associates just did an excellent job. When you look at January, certainly as you would expect, with some of the weather impacts and partially the contrary, we saw a little bit of softening in the more discretionary spend categories in that month and certainly that was a factor. So the mix of sales changed in the month of January. \nCarol Tome: We don\u2019t like to use weather as an excuse, but we think we probably lost $100 million in the month of January. Atlanta was frozen for (indiscernible)\u2026. \nGreg Melich - ISI Group: My other question was sort of bigger picture one to address it, we did implement the Affordable Care Act and one of the things we are watching was how many of your employees take up the new plan structured, anything you can update us there in terms of take up rates of your own plan or how you are baking into your guidance for SG&A will be helpful? \nFrank Blake: Yes, Greg. We are not going to get into the specific details around take up other than to say it was consistent with what we planned for. \nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Was it up, I assume? \nFrank Blake: Yes. \nGreg Melich - ISI Group: And I assume the guidance didn\u2019t change? \nCarol Tome: The guidance didn\u2019t change. Our HR team has done a fabulous job of working through ways to mitigate any cost pressures that may come at us by re-bidding out placement services, plan redesigns. So we are providing insurance for our associates and taking care of our shareholders at the same time. \nOperator: And we will go now to Michael Lasser from UBS. \nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Frank it seems like home prices and home price appreciation has been the biggest driver of the market for the last 12 to 18 months. At what point do you think turnover will again overtake that and you may see a recoupling between home improvement comps and housing turnover. \nFrank Blake: It's an interesting question. We were just talking about that question amongst ourselves and interestingly historically for us housing turnover has not been that great a predicator of our sales. If you go back over time and so I\u2019m not sure that the way the housing market will play out for us that as price appreciation slows down the correlation will shift to another element of the market. \nCarol Tome: So just a couple of data points for you, I find this to be very interesting. If you look at the correlation between housing turnover and home improvement sales between 2000 and 2013. You\u2019ve got a high R squared something like 0.7. If you look at it from the puree of 2010 to 2013, the R squared is 0.3. So the housing market is changing, it's a good way to explain but not necessarily good way to predict. \nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Carol I guess if you look at the metric from 2000 and 2010 presumably R squared would be higher? \nCarol Tome: Little bit but not much. \nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Okay my second question is on the acquisition of Blinds.com, as you become more proficient with interacting and engaging your customers online do you think that puts you more in the crosshairs or potentially more in the crosshairs of the online only retailers? \nCraig Menear: We think we\u2019re in those crosshairs. \nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: But even more so than you already are I think\u2026 \nCraig Menear: We don\u2019t think that does anything to our being in the crosshairs. We first of acquisition like Blinds.com as Carol said the explanation for it is the competences that it brings internally to allow us to better compete in interconnected retail but we imagine that pretty much everybody out there with an internet only offering that relates to home improvement already has a target on us. \nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Okay fair enough. Let me ask one last question, what\u2019s the duration look like from extreme weather conditions and spending associate with a repair from that. How would you contrast it to perhaps Tornado or Hurricane related spending? Thank you. \nFrank Blake: Michael that totally depends actually no win-spring breaks. So I would suspect there are and I can look at my own yard. There are people who have right now in needs [ph] but depending on when the spring breaks will depend on what that duration time is between the recognition of the need and the action to make it happen. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. \nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank: Two questions one on buyback so 5 billion this year it was really upside to that, I think a year ago you talked about 4.6 billion but said it could be upside to take on more debt and you surely did that and upside the number. A year later we are closer to a 2.0 target leverage ratio I think so just wondering if you can characterize any upside in that $5 billion number. \nCarol Tome: Well today we\u2019re planning $5 billion using excess cash and to your point we\u2019re not at our max target of two time\u2019s adjusted debt to EBITDA. Today we would have about $1.9 billion of borrowing availability if we were to leverage up to that target and we don\u2019t have any plans to do that right now. We raised a whole lot of debt last year and it's always a good idea to let some time lapse before you go back to the market. Just got have excellent execution. \nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank: Yeah makes sense. The second question and maybe this is just looking at you finally but your comp guidance suggest a 200 basis points of deceleration from 2013. I think about 50 basis points of that comes from housing. The other 150 basis points deceleration is that just being conservative not just prudent to expect the comp at 7% every year or is it something else in there that we should be thinking about? \nCarol Tome: I have asked you to think about commodities. In 2013, we enjoyed commodity inflation, not thinking that\u2019s going to happen this year. In fact, we are going to have some pressure from commodity price deflation. So that would be one driver. The other driver as you know is that we rolled out our extended clients\u2019 assortment to many of our stores, looking at 500 stores. So we will be lapping it against that. So that\u2019s just a little bit of headwinds on us. \nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank: And we don\u2019t plan on storms. \nCarol Tome: Thank you. We don\u2019t. \nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank: Right. \nCarol Tome: But we will take them. \nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank: Yes, very helpful. Just to go to can you quantify that quantity or is it commodity impact in \u201813 and \u201814? \nCarol Tome: It would be \u2013 I am going to be rounding here, it\u2019s 80 to 90 basis points. \nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank: Of the swing? \nCarol Tome: Yes. \nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank: Okay, thank you. \nCarol Tome: Yes. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Gary Balter from Credit Suisse. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Thank you. Just following up actually on the last question, how much share \u2013 how much of your comp sort of helped by share gain from some competitors that maybe struggling and what do you assume in your 2014 guidance? \nCarol Tome: Well, as Craig pointed out, pursuant to the NYEX definition, we enjoyed share appreciation in 2013 about 35 basis points of share appreciation. We still tend to build the plan based on share capture, that doesn\u2019t mean Gary that we won\u2019t do everything to get that share capture and take care of our customers. So we don\u2019t tend to plan for that. \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then you made some comments on Canada and the currency decline, is there a way and I am not a senior play economist, but given the declines that you have seen in their currency, which makes their purchasing power a little bit better for Canadians, do you think that that will help the underlying business at some point putting aside the currency impact? \nFrank Blake: The healthy underlying business in Canada? \nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Yes, I am sorry, go ahead. \nFrank Blake: As I said, Gary, the performance of our Canadian business very, very pleased with it. And our Canadian business is doing well in an environment where our competitors, Rona and some others are having great difficulty. So we expect continued success there, frankly regardless of the currency. \nOperator: Okay, thank you. And we will take our next question from Keith Hughes from SunTrust. \nKeith Hughes - SunTrust: Thank you. You finished off a great year with products \u2013 our projects $900 or greater given your comping against that in 2014, what kind of number you are expecting there in the same-store sale guidance you gave earlier? \nFrank Blake: So we actually plan our year based on growth for both transactions as well as ticket and we plan that roughly equal. And if you look at the year, we are pretty close to that in terms of it was pretty balanced between tickets and transactions. \nKeith Hughes - SunTrust: I was asking specifically around the transactions greater than $900? \nFrank Blake: No, Keith, we wouldn\u2019t plan at that level. \nKeith Hughes - SunTrust: Right, okay. Is your sense that it will be greater than the comp sales or come back down in line with it? \nFrank Blake: No, I think is if we see the continued recovery, I think the opportunity there driven by continuing pro-business, driven by customers taking on larger projects if their home values continue to hold, I think we could expect to see the bigger ticket continue to grow. \nCarol Tome: And from a shape of the year perceptive, I think the growth has been heavier in the back half than the first half, because we are still anniversary-ing from Sandy storms. In Q1, we have had about $150 million more or less in Q1 and Q2 was an outstanding year for us. So I think if we are trying to build a model that way, Keith, that\u2019s how I would build this. \nKeith Hughes - SunTrust: Okay, thank you. \nCarol Tome: Yes. \nDiane Dayhoff: So Lisa, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Okay. And we will take our next question from Alan Rifkin from Barclays. \nAlan Rifkin - Barclays: Thank you very much. Your growth in the dot com side of the business is quite admirable and given the investments that you have made to-date, one would have to assume that dot com continues to outpace the brick-and-mortar side. Carol, what effect on EBIT margins going forward will an accelerated growth on the dot com side of the business have on EBIT? \nCarol Tome: Well, couple of things about the profitability of our dot com business, first, year-on-year was much more profitable this year than last year, which is a good news story. And as we think about 2014 and beyond, we factored into our guidance the impact of a dot com business that\u2019s growing faster than the core, because to your point it is. \nAlan Rifkin - Barclays: Okay and one last question if I may, just playing Devil\u2019s Advocate here. I believe in the past you have actually said that the single most important macroeconomic variable to your business is GDP even greater than that of housing because GDP obviously incorporates housing plus everything else. Your guidance for GDP is actually higher in 2014 than 2013 and so even with the expected deflation in commodity prices that you\u2019re anticipating in 2014 why are we not looking for a slightly higher comp than what you\u2019ve laid out today? \nFrank Blake: So Alan I will make couple of comments and then Carol can add to them. Our commentary around GDP is being the most significant thing for us was those comments were given in the context of housing market that was frankly still flat to down. So in 2010 and 2011 when we were positively comping, what we were expressing was that that was a reflection of a recovery of GDP, we were not yet seeing and the country wasn\u2019t seeing a tailwind from housing. What we tried to layout both in our June 2012 and our December 2013 conferences was now we see a time when housing will be a tailwind to GDP and when you compare \u201914 to \u201913 a somewhat less of a tailwind than we saw in \u201913. Carol if you want to add some comments there? \nCarol Tome: Sure if you think of the drivers of housing that most impacted our business we do believe home prices will appreciate in 2014 but at half the rate they appreciated in 2013. So that is a year-over-year change. In terms of turnover we think the turnover as a percentage of units will be about 4% for that down slightly from 2013. All of this is a directionally correct but in place model, we\u2019re taking all the data that we can Alan and we come up with our point of view on what the business will do. \nDiane Dayhoff: Well thank you all today for joining us on our conference call and we look forward to you on our next quarter\u2019s conference call. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s conference and we thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-11-19 12:29:06", "content": "Executives: Diane Dayhoff - Vice President, Investor Relations Frank Blake - Chairman and CEO Craig Menear - Executive Vice President, Merchandising Carol Tome - Executive Vice President, Corporate Services and CFO Marvin Ellison - Executive Vice President, U S Stores Mark Holifield - Senior Vice President, Supply Chain\nAnalysts: Gary Balter - Credit Suisse Christopher Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer Dan Binder - Jefferies Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research Budd Bugatch - Raymond James Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates Keith Hughes - SunTrust Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup Michael Lasser - UBS Greg Melich - ISI Group Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please standby.

Now, let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thanks you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $19.5 billion, up 7.4% from last year. Comp sales were positive 7.4% and our diluted earnings per share were $0.95 per. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 8.2%. From a geographic perspective, sales were strong across the U.S. All of our U.S. regions posted positive comps in the quarter as did 39 of our top 40 markets. The only exception was New Orleans, which anniversaried the impact of Hurricane Isaac from last year. Our Mid-South, Southeast and Pacific North regions had our strongest comp performance with double-digit gains. During the quarter, we saw a strong growth in both transactions and ticket. We have now had 10 consecutive quarters of transaction and ticket growth, which we view as an encouraging sign of the balance in the growth of our business. We are also able to achieve operational improvement across key elements of our business with improvement in inventory turn, shrink performance and continued expense leverage. Our Merchandising as Craig will detail, the core categories of the store were solid and we saw strength in larger ticket categories, such as appliances and countertops. Project based categories such as tile and vanities performed well and our Services business grew double-digits. The recovery of our pro business continues in the third quarter, our pro business slightly faster pace than our consumer business. In addition to sales from our pro customers, we also track whether we draw an increase number of pros, we household our customer data looking at unique customers and account numbers, and we\u2019ve seen a steady year-over-year increase in the pro segment. During the quarter, we launched our first version of the mobile app for our pro customers. The app enables pros to see multiple stores inventory of one time, provides them direct access to our pro desks, tracks, receipts and provide other functionality that can help pros better manage their businesses. We will continue to upgrade and improve the app and are already ahead of our plan on downloads. We also continue to enhance our website and consumer mobile presence. During the quarter, we added enhanced communication for order delivery. Refresh category pages simplified the checkout process and invested across interconnected retail to improve the customer experience. Both traffic to the site and our conversion rate grew double digits in the quarter. Sales from our online channels, including those picked up in our stores, were up over 50% and are now approximately 3% of our total sales. Marvin and his team rolled out new first training focused specifically on the interconnected experience in our stores. We know that our customers are expecting a simple and easy experience shopping online and in our stores and in the intersection between the two. That has required new training for our associates as well as technological improvements. For example, during the quarter, we enabled our first phones to be able to process, buy online and pick up in-store or BOPUS and buy online, ship to store or BOSS orders. Previously an associate would have to go to a terminal for this activity, adding time to the customer\u2019s business and complexity to our process. Now with the First Phone, our associates can close the transaction immediately from wherever they are in the store. The training and additional technology have led to a significant improvement in our interconnected customer service. We separately track customer satisfaction scores on BOPUS and BOSS orders. Those scores have shown a marked improvement over the quarter, and we will continue to refine and improve this process. On the international front, our Mexican business positively comped for the quarter. That makes 40 quarters in a row for 10 years of quarter-over-quarter positive comp growth for our Mexican business -- a great achievement. Our Canadian business had positive comps for the eighth quarter in a row. As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are updating our sales and earnings guidance for the year based on our third quarter out-performance versus our plan and a somewhat more favorable outlook for the remainder of the year. We still face several headwinds in the fourth quarter, particularly the storm-related sales from last year. But the housing market continues to be positive. Private fixed residential investment or PFRI as a percent of GDP improved in this past quarter to 3.2% but it remains well below the 60-year average of approximately 4.6%. Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication throughout the quarter and for their ongoing efforts to assist those in need as the result of the tornado that hit the Midwest this past weekend. Based on this quarter's results, almost 100% of our stores will qualify for success sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. We're proud of that result and plan on carrying that forward into the fourth quarter. With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank and good morning everyone. We were pleased with our performance in the third quarter as sales exceeded our expectations. Strengthened core of the store, the continued resurgence for our pro-customers and mild temperatures helped us overcome difficult comparisons cycling last year\u2019s storm-related sales. All merchandising departments posted positive comps. Kitchens, lighting, d\u00e9cor, lumber, electrical, indoor garden, paint and bath were above the company average. Mower, flooring, plumbing, outdoor garden, building materials, hardware and tools performed positively but were below the company average. In the core of the store, maintenance and repair categories saw continued positive comp performance in products like ladders, light bulbs, air circulation, wiring devices, pipes and fittings, fasteners and builder\u2019s hardware. We\u2019ve also strengthened the core with comps above the company average in categories, such as lighting, countertops, floor tile, window coverings, faucets, vanities, fixtures, and special order carpet. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 400 stores with our enhanced appliance showroom, a reset that we began last year. Using localization tools in these stores that have various footprints, we optimize the space between our kitchen appliance showrooms and showcase our expanded assortment. This expanded assortment is also available online and as a result, we experienced double-digit growth for appliances both in-store and online in the third quarter. As Frank mentioned, total customer sales continue to gain strength and while approached up across the store, we saw a double-digit comp growth in categories such as gypsum, concrete, pressure-treated lumber and moldings. Mild weather throughout much of the quarter and across the country continued to drive sales in our exterior project categories. For example, sales in exterior stains and water sealers, pressure washers and exterior paint, all posted comps above the company average. Our Labor Day and fall clean-up events provide great values and were well received by our customers resulting in solid comps in grills, storage, and soils and mulches. Total transactions grew by 4%, while average ticket increased 3.2% for the quarter. Our average ticket increase was positively impacted somewhat by commodity price inflation from products, such as lumber and copper. The total impact of comp growth from commodity inflation was approximately 45 basis points. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 3.1% from third quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 10.3% in the third quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were continued strength in our pro business, appliances, HVAC, countertops and in-stock kitchens. Now, let me turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Our strategy of partnering with our suppliers for exclusive launches of new and innovative products continues to gain traction. During the fourth quarter, we\u2019re excited about the launch of the Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector. Its alarm quiets down when you wave your hand at it and sends a message to your phone if the alarm goes off or batteries run low. Instead of just chirping at you, it speaks with a human voice and gives a friendly heads up before burning toast can turn into emergency. We\u2019re also introducing new technology in door locks with the Kevo Bluetooth Deadbolt from Kwikset. With Kevo, your smartphone is your key. You can share keys with visitors, monitor lock activity and delete or disable access, all from the mobile app. Finally there is innovation in lighting from Cree with the launch of the Cree TrueWhite bulb. The TrueWhite LED bulb gives out some of the best natural color when compared to other LED bulbs in the market and is a great compliment to the product launches that we have celebrated this year. We have an outstanding offering of products in our Gift Centers for the holiday season. This year we\u2019re featuring a Ryobi One Plus Cordless drill that includes two lithium ion batteries, charger and carrying case at a price below the Ni-Cd alternatives in the market today. For our pro customers, we have exclusive values on Power Tools combo kits from Makita, Milwaukee and Rigid. And we\u2019re also introducing the Husky Total Socket. The Husky Total Socket is an adjustable wrench, one tool that replaces up to 44 sockets. It also features a lower profile than standard socket wrenches allowing you to give them the tight spaces. We have our best lineup yet in holiday decor. We continue to bring innovation in the latest offerings to our customers and we're becoming a leading destination for the category both in store and through our extended assortment online. We\u2019re committed to simplifying holiday decor for our customers, about half of our pre-lit artificial tree assortment is designed with a quick set electro-connections. This connect the poles to the base and your tree will illuminate hassle free. Making it easy for our customers to enjoy the holidays and providing great values, will allow us to win this holiday season. Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the outstanding Black Friday special buyers that we have planned this year with extreme values for our traditional DIYers and professional customers, including some amazing offers on appliances. Going to our stores or online and I think that you will agree this is one of our most exciting lineups yet. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Craig and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $19.5 billion, a 7.4% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 7.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 8.7% in August, 8.2% in September and 5.6% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 8.2% for the quarter with positive comps of 9.6% in August, 9.4% in September and 6.2% in October. Our total company gross margin was 34.9% for the quarter, an increase of 35 basis points from last year, of which 32 basis points came from our U.S. business. Our gross margin expansion in the U.S. is explained by the following factors: First, we experienced 22 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply-chain due primarily to higher productivity. Second, we experienced approximately 17 basis points of gross margin expansion due to the impact of gross margin accretive businesses that were acquired in 2012. Third, our shrink reduction efforts continued to gain traction and we realized 2 basis points of margin expansion due to lower shrink. Finally, we experienced 9 basis points of gross margin contraction due to a change in the mix of products sold, the majority of which was due to a higher penetration of clientele than one year ago. Our total company gross margin performance also reflects $10 million of inventory liquidation costs associated with our China store closings in 2012 that did not repeat this year. While we continue to project modest gross margin expansion for the year, as we look to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect our gross margin to decline roughly 15 basis points from what we reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, due primarily to certain gross margin benefits recognized last year that we do not expect to repeat. In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 187 basis points to 23.1%. Our spend leverage reflects our strong sales performance and some favorable year-over-year comparison. As you will recall, in the third quarter of 2012, we closed our stores in China and incurred $155 million of operating closing costs that did not repeat this year. Adjusting for the China store closing, we leveraged operating expenses by 101 basis point -- better than our plan. For the year, we expect our expenses to grow at approximately 34% of our sales growth on a 52-week basis. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $188 million, a 25.3% increase from last year, reflecting new interest expense associated with $2 billion of incremental debt issued in April, and an additional $3.25 billion of incremental debt issued in September of this year. Proceeds from the September debt issuance will be used to repay $1.25 billion of outstanding debt that is coming due in December with the remainder to be used for share repurchases. I\u2019d also like to note that during the quarter, we received an upgrade from Standard & Poor\u2019s taking our long-term debt rating to single A. Our income tax provision rate was 35.8% in the third quarter and for the year we expect our tax provision to be approximately 36.5%. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.95, an increase of 50.8% from last year. Adjusting for the cost of the China store closing, our diluted earnings per share grew 28.4% from the same period in the prior year. Now moving to our operational metrics. During the third quarter, we opened two new stores in Mexico for an ending total company store count of 2,260. At the end of the third quarter, selling square foot was 236 million and total sales per square foot were $329, up 7.2% from last year. At the end of the quarter, inventory was roughly $11.3 billion and inventory turns were 4.7 times, up from 4.6 times last year. We ended the quarter with $43.8 billion in assets, including $4.9 billion in cash. Moving to our share repurchase program. In the third quarter, we received 2.4 million share related to the true-up of an accelerated share repurchase or ASR program we initiated in the second quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter we repurchased $2.1 billion or 24.5 million of our outstanding shares. This included $600 million or 8.1 million shares repurchased in the open market and 16.4 million shares repurchased through an ASR program. For the shares repurchased under the ASR program, this is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon completion of the ASR program in the fourth quarter. Further, we plan to repurchase an additional $2.1 billion of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter, bringing our total shares repurchases to $8.5 billion for the year. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 19.7%, 316 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2012. As we look to the fourth quarter, please remember that the fourth quarter of 2012 had an extra week, contributing $1.2 billion of sales and $0.07 of earnings per share that will not repeat in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Additionally, we are up against some very tough comparisons, as we had approximately $255 million of storm-related sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 that we don\u2019t expect to repeat. Thus, we had a great third quarter, exceeded our plan in all departments and our business momentum continues. Housing is a bright spot in our economy. As such, we are forecasting our fourth quarter sales and earnings to be stronger than our plan. So today, we are lifting our 2013 sales and earnings per share growth guidance, reflecting our year-to-date performance and our forecast for the fourth quarter. We now expect fiscal 2013 sales to increase by approximately 5.6%, with positive comps on a 52-week like for like basis of approximately 7%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now project fiscal 2013 diluted earnings-per-share to increase approximately 24% to $3.72. This earnings-per-share guidance includes a $6.4 billion of shares repurchases completed in the first three quarters of 2013 and our intent through purchase an additional $2.1 billion in shares during the fourth quarter. We look forward to talking with you at our Investor Conference on December 11th in Boston, where we will update you on our key strategic initiatives and progress towards reaching our longer-term financial goals. We thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Jake, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll hear first from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Thank you. Congratulations on just another solid, solid -- good quarter. Frank and Carol and everybody, question is -- a couple years ago when you had your last Analyst Meeting you highlighted that you're more focused on GDP as your driver as opposed to PFRI or previous housing metrics that you used. Yet, your numbers have clearly been better than GDP and Carol, you just finished -- you talked about housing being one of the drivers. As you look at your results and you look at the opportunities in housing, are you rethinking the metrics that you used from a macro perspective?\nCarol Tome: Well, Gary, thanks for your question and for your comments. Thank you very much. We still think GDP is the basis for sales growth, but as you know we have an imperfect but directionally correct model that gives us some insight as to how housing is driving our sales. Now, it\u2019s hard to nail it on a quarter that for the year we feel pretty good about what our model is telling us. So as you know, we\u2019ve just increased our comps for 2013 to 7%. And in case we get there is this way. First, we start with the GDP estimate of around 2%. Then, we add to that what we think housing is contributing to our sales. We look at housing turnover, home price appreciation and new household formation. And when we look at those drivers, we think housing is contributing about 250 basis points of our growth. To that, we add the benefits that we've enjoyed this year from commodity price inflation that\u2019s maybe around 80 basis points for the year. The benefits that we are enjoying from our new expanded appliance assortment that\u2019s another 80 basis points, and then there is about 90 basis from that that\u2019s just coming from other growth via new innovations that we are bringing into stores, great execution by our store associates. But that\u2019s how we get to the 7%.\nOperator: Now we will take a question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan: Following up on the housing topic, there has been -- some of the metrics recently have slowed or at least perhaps plateauing and even had a lot of rate volatility. So I was curious what your thoughts are around that if you\u2019re seeing anything in your business and [indiscernible] is what you are seeing today simply a lag effect that would suggest that later on as we start to comp the comp and see the lag from slower housing metrics that things are going to be slower in the future?\nFrank Blake: Chris, one of the things that I think \u2013 Carol might want to elaborate on this, is for us a new home construction is less important as a driver of our business than what is happening with existing homes both turnover and most importantly price appreciation. We've long thought that one of the key determinants of our business is do people feel good about investing in their house, because they\u2019re going to see pricing appreciation in their home. And that continues to move forward at a pretty good pace. But Carol, you may want to add into more detail.\nCarol Tome: Sure. So we\u2019ve regressed ourselves both against 10 year treasuries and 30 year mortgages, to see if there is any sort of correlation and we can\u2019t see it. But all that being said, we do pay the similar attention, as Frank mentioned, to both housing turnover and home prices. And if we were to see housing turnover decline because of a rising rate environment, we would then look to see, what\u2019s happening with the home prices. And if home prices were to decline, then we might have a different point of view on the housing recovery, but we are not seeing that. And for us anyway we think home price appreciation has been the biggest contributor of our sales growth this year. And if you look at the Kasur [ph] data, that shows that home prices are up 10% year-on-year and if you look at the composite index maybe up closer to 13%, but still 25% lower than their peak. So we think that there is a lot of room for recovery and it\u2019s not going to stop in the short term.\nChristopher Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan: And how much of that do you think is that perhaps \u2013 is the underinvestment that in the homes of durable products, filled with durable products and if there is this recapture effect, as people had under-spent for a number of years?\nFrank Blake: That\u2019s a tough one to answer, Chris. I would say many years ago somebody\u2019s comment and economist\u2019s comment to us was look for when consumers start to think as of a granite countertop as an expense rather than an investment. And our hypothesis \u2013 there are a lot of things that people want to do with their home, whether it's just improving the livability or actually fixing things up, that is determined by that investment versus expense factor.\nCarol Tome: [indiscernible] interesting work that shows people who have positive equity in their home and that comes as a result of rising home prices. People who have positive equity in their home spend three times as much as those who have negative equity in their home.\nOperator: Brian Nagel, Oppenheimer will have the next question.\nBrian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Question on the pro-customer. The comments you made today in your prepared remarks suggest that the pro-business for you continues to improve. And if I look back over the prior few quarters, it seems like we are seeing a strengthening trend there. The question I have, how should we think about the potential for pro going forward and with the backdrop of improving house environment?\nFrank Blake: So Brian, I would say, first off, it has been really for the last several years one of our key indicators on recovery, because the pro customer was hit harder and for us during the housing crash, and now is recovery. Going forward and you see it a bit this past quarter, we would expect pro to be growing at or maybe slightly better than the rate of our consumer. But really the catch-up has happened and now they should both be growing probably at about the same rate. And it will probably bounce a bit back and forth depending on the quarter. Second quarter consumer grew slightly more than pro. Third quarter pro grew slightly more than consumer. But the good news is both are experiencing growth.\nBrian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: And then as a quick follow up, if I could, for Carol. If you look at the expense leverage \u2013 more like it\u2019s more of a modeling question \u2013 if you look at the expense leverage here in the third quarter versus what we saw in the second quarter, it was much better. In the second quarter you called out the -- step up in incentive compensation, I know there is a lot of moving up, was that basically the difference Q2 to Q3?\nDiane Dayhoff: [Phil], there a number of things that drove the differences between the quarters. In the second quarter of 2012 we had some good guys that didn\u2019t repeat, including positive expense resulting from our casualty reserve analysis. As we look to the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2013, we are going to have higher expenses related to compensation and we are really thrilled. In fact, if you just put our expenses into perspective for you, if you back to the beginning of the year and the guidance that we gave, you fast forward now to the end of the third quarter. We have increased our sales growth guidance by $2.9 billion. We have increased our expense guidance by $180 million. And of the $180 million, this is all implied in the guidance that I given you, of the $180 million, a third of that is variable compensation, success sharing and bonus.\nBrian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDan Binder - Jefferies: Hi. Good morning. Congratulations on a good quarter.\nFrank Blake: Thank you.\nDan Binder - Jefferies: My question was regarding the appliance reset. I was wondering if you can give us any more color around how the storage with the full reset are performing in that category versus the storage that have not received the resets, specifically in the appliance business?\nCraig Menear: Dan, the -- obviously, the customer has responded well to the expanded brands that we have and where we are able to show that footprint, we are seeing very nice lift in those stores. But also remember that all those brands became available to all stores through homedepot.com and as a result, we have seen nice lift really in all stores and seeing category growth in every subset of appliance business. So we are very pleased with how that is going so far.\nDan Binder - Jefferies: I guess, I was wondering because, as you look at the two difference sets, the reset obviously is pretty impressive and I\u2019m just curious how many stores you will ultimately put that in and why you wouldn\u2019t put in certain stores versus others, because it seems like it\u2019s a material improvement over what you had?\nCraig Menear: I mean, we certainly intend to continue to look at the opportunity. We don\u2019t see this as a fit for all stores, but clearly there is opportunity for us to continue to improve in additional stores and we will evaluate that as we continue to watch the performance.\nDiane Dayhoff: We will talk more about this at our Investor conference because we are going to lay out our goals for \u201914 and we will talk to you about our capital where it\u2019s going.\nDan Binder - Jefferies: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Now we will take a question from Matthew Fassler, Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Hello and good morning.\nFrank Blake: Good morning.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: A couple of questions. First of all, can you talk to us, how to think about the cadence of the business, given the trend you saw in October and the compares that that you faced here in Q4, maybe any initial comments on the tone of business? November is presumably you are facing kind of the piece of the Sandy compares, it would be very helpful?\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, sure, as you know, we did a lot better than we thought we would do in the third quarter and the cadence of the business, it\u2019s really our reflection of year-over-year comparison. So we had strong comps, not all three months, but obviously October was our lowest comping months. If you think about that\u2019s when we were up against the Sandy sales in last year and we had $122 million of Sandy sales in October, also, if you think about one of our largest Gulf region. The Gulf region had a terrific month in October, but slowed down year-on-year because the prior year they had double-digit comps coming off of other storm sales. So we were pleased with the cadence of the business and now as we have entered into the fourth quarter and obviously, it\u2019s very early in the fourth quarter, our toughest compare is ahead, our hardest comp of month is the month of December that now -- we lift the guidance today because we think we are going to do better than we originally thought in the fourth quarter and we wouldn\u2019t have done that today, if we haven\u2019t started off ahead of our expectations.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Great. And then the second question, as we look at the expectation for EBITD for this year on a full year basis. You are sort of creeping up to that 12% number, probably a little faster than you thought you would when you first issued that guidance, I guess, about a year and a half ago? How does that lead you to think about the long-term target, would probably becomes quite germane as you look towards next year, or expectations probably are going to start to get to that number?\nCraig Menear: So Matt, the good news is we have our conference coming up in just a few weeks. And so we will be able to lay that out for you and everyone then.\nOperator: And we will take a question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.\nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: A question on the balance of ticket and traffic. I think the last time I saw a ticket and traffic so well balanced, actually if you go back to the fourth year 2000. I was just wondering if you can talk about whether or not you find that as significant and what it says about the business and if you would expect the shape of that to change as this cycle progresses?\nFrank Blake: Yes, the first comment on this \u2013 as I said in my opening comments, we do find that as \u2013 see that as a real positive for the balance of the growth of our business. And obviously it\u2019s something we\u2019d like to sustain.\nCraig Menear: Aram, it\u2019s definitely something we work on consistently to drive both traffic and ticket. And we do think it\u2019s important. Certainly it\u2019s a measure of how well the assortments are performing within the store. Clearly we have seen nice growth in big ticket categories for several quarters in a row now. And again our pro contributes to that, things like kitchens and HVAC, all that has been positive contributors. But likewise, we have been really focused on making sure that we capture the opportunity for the consumer with the smaller tickets as well and some of the key driving factors behind the lower ticket categories, things like bulbs and part tool accessories and fasteners that are being driven, with larger projects and more pro business, as well as great innovation in products like spray paint and hand tools that have allowed us to drive the smaller tickets. So it\u2019s something that we really focus on to try to bring a balanced approach to the business.\nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: So it\u2019s not easy to stay and stock on a lot of those stuff, smaller ticket items and the comping is hard to do, you must be doing a great job on the supply chain.\nCraig Menear: The supply chain is definitely helping with awesome in-stock position while leveraging inventory.\nOperator: We will take the next question from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: I guess my first question really has to do with the leverage factor, Carol. You talked about 34% for the year. I wonder if you could maybe give us some more color on the fourth quarter, and how should we think about that for 2014 and beyond now?\nCarol Tome: So if you look to the fourth quarter, our expense growth factor will be higher than it was in the third quarter for a couple of reasons. It will be higher because of incentive comp. We\u2019ve just raised our guidance, which means we are going to blow through with the plan that we put together, which is great news for our store associates and for everyone who is bonus or success sharing eligible. So that will drive year-over-year outperformance and higher expense growth, if you will. We also put some of our \u2013 we\u2019ve got a year-over-year comparisons related to China. Last year we had a good guy in China, it was a $20 million good guy and that will not repeat. So if I look at our expense growth factor in the fourth quarter, it will be more like 50% of our sales growth, for the year it\u2019s 34%. And as Frank pointed out, we\u2019ve got an investor conference coming up on December 11 and we will give you longer term point of view on expenses at that time.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: And my follow-up question, just you talked about \u2013 you did better than you expected. Can you give us \u2013 can you quantify how much better than you expected, you did in both sales and maybe earnings?\nCarol Tome: Sure. I am happy to do it from an earnings perspective. Well, I will give two for both, why not. So we beat our sales plan by about $700 million and we beat our earnings plan from an earnings per share perspective by about $0.10 per share.\nOperator: We will take a question from Dennis McGill, Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: First question would just be, as it relates to mix within categories, I am thinking about consumers\u2019 willingness to trade up, can you maybe just elaborate on what you are seeing there and maybe any examples whether you, I guess, a) are seeing mix benefits, and b), if you are, where that might be?\nCraig Menear: That\u2019s we are seeing customers\u2019 willing to spend particularly where you are bringing innovative product that helps them complete their job faster, saves them money so things like LED which is a significant premium in the market compared to incandescent or halogen for that matter or CFL bulbs were seeing terrific growth in that as customers understand the value proposition. Likewise when you think about tools, lithium continues to grow. It carries a premium price in the market, particularly pro tools because the performance and hence have been there and we\u2019re in about our fourth generation of lithium battery technology over the past five years. So we\u2019ve seen customers step up there. And likewise we\u2019re seeing customers willing to step up and things that we tested, for example a 100 gallon Japanese maple tree for $3,000 this spring. And we were actually quite surprised at how that sold. So there are customers willing to step up and likewise at the same time, we need to be conscious that there are more runners in the market today less space. So we\u2019re also looking at the opening price point or the smaller items within our categories as well. For example, we added in products in our cleaning where we took it out of club packs if you will and brought in singles and we\u2019ve seen nice response with that as well.\nMarvin Ellison: This is Marvin. And also double-digit growth in the services installed business reflection our customers willingness to trade up and take on bigger ticket purchases.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: So I guess, it sounds like innovation to big part of it, if I said it different way the better and best portion of the price spectrum gaining share at the expense of good if you look across the store?\nCraig Menear: No, we didn\u2019t necessarily say that. I think the opportunity that we\u2019ve seen is we have customers willing to step up but not necessarily seen the decline in the opening price point.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: And then second question, the fourth quarter comp which you highlighted seems to be recurring theme that we\u2019ve seen out for a last few years and you continue to rest that comp I think above expectations after the quarters wrapped up, or I guess said another way the fourth quarter seems to be coming a bigger portion of the storage, you get into more d\u00e9cor in holiday items. How should we think about that growing piece of the pie in relations to how you\u2019re approaching merchandising in the categories that are in the box?\nFrank Blake: Certainly one of things that we\u2019re trying to do is in many ways create our home seasons, if you will. And so we have seen tremendous growth over the past several years with our holiday d\u00e9cor program as a driver of both traffic to the stores, new customers coming in to the Home Depot so that has been nice. We have likewise focused on the opportunity that we have around the gift giving holiday season with Black Friday. We put a bigger effort around that as well, but even with those things said we have a lot of customers doing projects every single day in our stores. And we\u2019re continuing to focus on the core of the store as well, which is a key factor, things like paint remain one of the top categories. Customers need cleaning products. They need bulbs and so on throughout the year. And that\u2019s really been our focus is to drive productivity through our assortment in our base on a consistent basis quarter-over-quarter.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Great, best of luck guys.\nCarol Tome: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take a question from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.\nKeith Hughes - SunTrust: Thank you. My question on gross margin you discussed in the prepared text, the 15 basis point sequential decline, can you give any more detail on what\u2019s happening as in the third and fourth on that metric?\nCarol Tome: Happy to, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had 15 basis points gross margin expansion coming from improved strength. As you know, Keith, I -- we\u2019ve been really working on to across much effort to manage our shrink down. We\u2019ve done a great job but we don\u2019t expect that 15 basis points to repeat in the fourth quarter. The other thing that\u2019s happening from a year-over-year perspective is if you look at the nature of the product sold in January, there is margin coming off of that tends to be higher than the nature of product sold both in December and November. In the fourth quarter of last year, we had an extra week, that extra week was in the month of January that had a higher margin rate, well just the year-over-year comparison is causing that 15 basis points decline.\nKeith Hughes - SunTrust: That 15 basis points is year over year, correct?\nCarol Tome: It is.\nKeith Hughes - SunTrust: And then second question -- I believe it was Marvin mentioned earlier about the installed product being strong in the quarter. Is there any specific product that was stronger than other in the last quarter or two?\nMarvin Ellison: I mean across the board, when you think about installed businesses, well you think about carpet, you think about kitchens, countertops, we had strength really in the flooring side of the business. We also had strength across the board from a kitchen standpoint. We are pleased with that business. We worked really hard to simplify the entire offering in the process. As you can imagine, big ticket and also big complexity, so we are working really hard on the customer experience and we are going to talk at the investor conference of our vision of how you take our flooring model and how we\u2019ve really transitioned it into three easy steps with the customer. We\u2019re going to try transition more of our installed businesses to similar format. But overall we\u2019re pleased with that entire business platform.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take the next question from Kate McShane, Citi Research.\nKate McShane \u2013 Citigroup: I wondered if we could hear a little bit more about ongoing improvements in supply chain. It seemed like you benefited more this quarter with the 22 basis points of gross margin expansion from the supply chain. Can you walk us through if there were any meaningful changes during the quarter?\nCarol Tome: Well I can start and maybe Mark Holifield will jump in. As I look at it from at least the lens of the CFO we had higher units per hour. We had better outbound and inbound cubic utilization which drove productivity throughout the supply chain. But it didn't just stop us there. We also had about a basis points of benefit coming from lower fuel costs. And then we had about 7 basis points coming -- this is all within the 22 basis points, 7 basis points coming from lower cost within our international distribution channel. Mark, do you want a give any more color?\nMark Holifield: Yes, Carol has run down the key points there in terms of the key contributors to productivity. I would just add that, that occurred across the board all of our distribution platforms. Our direct-to- store expenses for transportation and our international logistics were all leveraged during the quarter.\nKate McShane \u2013 Citigroup: And my second question is kind of a longer-term question, Carol, you've always given your opinion on what you thought could be the next leg for growth in the housing market aside from the turnover and higher prices and that was the easing of the availability of mortgages. I just wondered if you could maybe update us on what your opinion is on timing or anything you are hearing with regard to that?\nCarol Tome: Kate, that's still an opportunity, isn't it? If you think about it the underwriting standards are very tight. There was a recent survey of banks, 79% of the respondents said that they have not loosened up on their underwriting standards. And you can appreciate that in some perspective because they are all faced with higher capital requirements. They are trying to make a buck in a low interest rate environment. So taking on more risk is difficult for these prudential institutions. But you sure need some movement there because that I think would just be a big boost to the steepness of the recovery. We also continue to believe there needs to be a reform with the GAC and there is a lot of dialogue there but nothing really happening. But if we were to get some movement in the space I think we'd see a sharper recovery than what we are experiencing.\nOperator: Michael Lasser with UBS will have the next question.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: I'm curious about the week-to- week volatility with the track [ph] that you're seeing in stores. How does it compare to what you saw a year or two ago when the cycle just started to build? And then how does that compare to the depth of the decline? Are you just seeing more consistent traffic build on a week -to- week basis at this point?\nFrank Blake: Michael, you're getting us -- I don't think we have a good answer for you. In terms of whether -- if I understand your question is whether the delta on traffic week-to-week, whether that differential is narrower with a recovering market or steeper. And it's an interesting question and don't have an answer for you.\nCarol Tome: Michael, we'll get back to you.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: Okay. Is it more consistent now so you --\nFrank Blake: Yes. So, I understand the question. To be honest, we just haven't analyzed that.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: Okay.\nFrank Blake: It\u2019s a great question.\nCarol Tome: We will have to figure out how to have normalize for weather, because that certainly impacts traffic. But we will look at that, it\u2019s a good question.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: Yeah. Okay. The other question I had, if you look within the basket of Pro customers, is there anything to suggest that you are starting to take share within categories where you have historically underindexed relative to that kind of customer, I think probably the prototypical product is paint, but I am -- presumably there is others as well?\nCraig Menear: I would say that when we look at our unit productivity across many Pro dominated categories, we are very, very pleased, whether that be things like dimensional lumber, plywood, concrete, we are extremely pleased with the performance and actually the growth in terms of quarter-over-quarter growth as well. And it\u2019s a little bit hard to tell you around share with the Pro because it\u2019s a very fragmented market against a lot of competitors, lumbar building material, supply houses, electrical distributors. And that data is a little bit harder to get at, but given the unit productivity we have, we feel pretty solid, so we think we are taking some share.\nMarvin Ellison: Mike, this is Marvin. The only I think I will add to that, the expanded appliance offering gave us the ability with property investors to have a better and more economical offering for appliances and so we are seeing strength in that category. Craig noted that appliances was really strong across the broad. The Pro segment contributed to that, other than that I think, Craig answered the question pretty well.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.\nFrank Blake: Yes.\nOperator: We will now take the next question from Greg Melich with ISI Group.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Hi, thanks. I had a couple of questions. One is on gross margin, just to understand the fourth quarter a bit more. Historically, your fourth quarter gross margin usually gets better sequentially and I would've thought supply chain and other things wouldn't go away. So, I understand last year's comparison, but if you just look at sequentially, why would gross margins be down a little bit, if I take your guidance, right.\nCarol Tome: Sequentially they will be. I\u2019m just talking year-over-year.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Okay. You are talking you got it.\nCarol Tome: Yes.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: And on online, so if I got the number right, it was up 50%, was that in the prepared comments?\nCarol Tome: Yes.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Was there acquisitions or anything else driving that or what changed and then how does that impacts traffic and ticket and all the other metrics we talk about because that's a point of revenue?\nCarol Tome: Yes. We are very pleased with our online performance. We have been talking to a lot about all the investments that we are making from an interconnected experience and it's starting to play out in terms of sales. So as Frank pointed out, about 3% of our total sales are now online, up 50% year-on-year, I can give you a little color as it relates to traffic. Traffic for our company was up 13 million year-on-year, 1 million of that was driven by our online property. But remember, Greg, we look at this totally interconnected, how do we increase [strong growth] [ph] in our stores, how our stores did the same thing for our online presence and it seems to be getting good traction.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: And there was no acquisition.\nCarol Tome: No, there was no acquisition.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Nothing else turned that on. And then lastly Carol, could you update us on credit? You talked about how generally speaking banks have not shifted their underwriting standards. How have you guys been able to maybe help your consumer out to offset that?\nCarol Tome: Yeah. Well, our private-label grew from a penetration perspective. They grew 68 basis points in the quarter. We are now standing at 23.4%. If you look at the consumer approval rates, they were up 150 basis points year-on-year, so now 69%. The through the door FICO score is 715. So, it\u2019s still pretty doggone high. But I'm glad to see that the approval rates are up. Those lines for consumers are about $5,700 and they're about 26% utilized. On the Pro, with credit, I think is actually more important. We also saw approval rates at 69%. At much higher rate, the average line is around $8,400 and what we're doing for the Pro is a couple of things. It's very targeted, it's very focused, but for our large spend pros, we will work with them to extend the lines. So we work with the underwriter of the program and we will go back and extend the lines. We think that makes good sense. We also have a card called the prox card, which is a payment term card using at least 30 days. For certain select Pro customers, we will extend the payment days to 45 days or 60 whatever it is on a case by case basis. So we are working very closely with the underwriters to give credit to this very important customer.\nOperator: Next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets : Hey guys Scot Ciccarelli. The slowdown that we saw in the month of October, was that more on the transaction side or ticket side, because obviously if there was more ticket that might just be a mix issue? And I know you guys have touched a little bit upon big ticket sales during this call, but is there any reason to believe that the momentum we've seen in that kind of category or bucket should flow anytime soon?\nFrank Blake: So, on the sales slowdown, basically, we are up against $122 million of storm from a year ago. And so that's spread across things like generators and cleaning and those type of categories. Batteries, flashlights, so that's really the pressure that you saw in October and the year-over-year.\nCarol Tome : So more tickets than transaction.\nFrank Blake: Yes.\nCarol Tome: Because those generated are big ticket item.\nCraig Menear: Big ticket, right. And then as it relates to big ticket in general, as I mentioned earlier, we've had several quarters in a row now of strong growth in big tickets. And don't really see why that would change going forward, we have continued opportunities to grow big ticket categories. Things like appliances, things like kitchens, flooring all those have been key focuses for us to continue to enhance our offerings, our assortments. And we saw strong growth in those categories again.\nCarol Tome : And Craig if I may we saw an increase in items per basket in the third quarter. That's a second quarter in the row where we\u2019ve seen that and that's a contributor isn't it to the big ticket growth.\nCraig Menear: It is. And as Marvin mentioned earlier likewise our installed business have seen nice growth as well and we see that continuing going forward.\nOperator: And that question will come from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: The improved sales in the second half both 3Q and 4Q relative to your expectations. Any specific categories or areas of the store that you would look at and say we thought this would wouldn't be as good as its turning out to be?\nCarol Tome : Yes so we did about 400 basis points better from a gross rate perspective in the third quarter within our expectations. And we had thought that we would see a drag from appliances, we thought that we would see commodity deflation and we didn't expect to have a good weather in the third quarter. And when you add that all up, that contributed about 230 basis points of that outperformance, because we didn't get commodity inflation appliances grew and weather was the help. And then the remaining 170 basis points was across the store. Let's say, as Craig pointed out, every department was positive. And as we look to the fourth quarter, we're expecting more of the same.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Within that, I guess the appliance drag is this the category you expected to be slower or the payback from your expansion initiatives and market share efforts you expected to be slower or what if we drill into that specifically?\nFrank Blake: Yes, if you remember right, Eric, we had begun to roll out expanded showroom at the end of third quarter last year actually beginning in the third quarter into the fourth quarter and we thought that we would see tougher comps as we came over those rollouts from a year ago. But that wasn't the case.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: And then secondly on the impact of Sandy in October. From a basis point perspective, what was roughly the impact, it looks like its 150 or 200 basis points , was the impact of that ?\nCarol Tome : Well I will give you the dollar and you can calculate it. Last year we had $122 million of Sandy sale, this year we had $10 million of Sandy sale, it's a net deduct of $112 million.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to meeting with you at our conference in Boston on December 11.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-08-20 12:23:03", "content": "Executives: Diane Dayhoff - Vice President, Investor Relations Frank Blake - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear - Executive Vice President - Merchandising Carol Tome - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President - Corporate Services Marvin Ellison - Executive Vice President - U.S. Stores\nAnalysts: Gary Balter - Credit Suisse Dan Binder - Jefferies Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Peter Benedict - Robert Baird Michael Lasser - UBS Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs Greg Melich - ISI Group Budd Bugatch - Raymond James Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer Kate McShane - Citigroup Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank\nOperator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Home Depot second quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

Now, let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thanks you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $22.5 billion, up 9.5% from last year. Comp sales were positive 10.7% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.24 per. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 11.4%. We expected the second quarter to be our strongest comping quarter of the year. The results exceeded our expectations. We grew sales by almost $2 billion in the quarter, posted the first double-digit positive comp in our business since 1999, and had the highest quarterly transaction count in the company's history. From a geographic perspective, sales were strong across the U.S. Two-thirds of our regions posted double-digit comps. All of our top-40 markets posted positive comps and 98% of all of our markets were positive. So, the strength in the business was broad-based geographically. This was also true across our merchandising categories. Every one of our merchandising departments exceeded plan for the quarter. As Craig will detail, we saw particular strength in our spring seasonal categories. As you know, we had a weaker than expected selling season for outdoor categories in the first quarter because of the late spring, but that was counterbalanced by strength in this quarter as the weather turned more favorable. The core categories in our store remained strong and we were pleased with the growth in our appliance business where we have added key brands and with the growth in the core categories like soft flooring, vanities and special order cabinets. With respect to our customer base, we continued to see strength in our pro-business. In the first quarter, our pro customer growth outpaced our consumer growth. For the second quarter, the growth rates were comparable. This reflects less of slowdown in pro than a pickup in our consumer sales. And as in the first quarter, our larger pros were our fastest growing customer group, but we also saw continued improvement in our smaller lower spending pros. On the international front, our Mexican business positively comped for the quarter making it 39 quarters in a row of positive comps. And, our Canadian business, had positive comps for the seventh quarter in a row. This quarter tested our ability to react and be flexible significant outperformance to plan obviously presents some interesting operational and merchandising challenges. On the operational front, Marvin and his team were able to adjust store staffing and handle unexpected volume and transaction growth while maintaining customer satisfaction levels. Earlier in the year, Marvin introduced project Simple into store operations, dramatically reducing the administrative tasking within the stores. This played an important role in freeing up our store leadership to respond to changed circumstances. On the merchandising side, many of the improvements that Craig, our merchants, Mark Holifield and supply chain team have made in our forecasting and replenishment systems that helped business react to and recover from sales pipes while keeping inventory under control. On interconnected retail, we are at the point where almost one out of every three online orders are completed in the store either through Buy Online Pickup in Store, or buy online ship to store. This is important to us, because we believe our more than 2,000 store locations throughout North America are valuable convenience for customers and can and should be a competitive advantage for us. Of course customers have the opportunity to buy additional items when they come into our store and return or pickup a product as today one out of five customers do. We are also pleased with the improvements we are making to the customer experience in our services business as we develop new project and communication tools online. In the second quarter, we continued the rollout of a functionality we call MyInstall, that will provide customer-specific installation information, dynamic tracking to keep them informed on the status of the installation, e-mail notifications for appointments and a point of contact to process order changes and alike. This provides both, a better customer experience and a better foundation for us to manage the business that is growing at a double-digit pace. As we look towards the back half of the year, consensus GDP forecast continue to call for only modest growth. Housing data however are encouraged, private fixed residential investment or PFRI as a percent of GDP improved to 3.1% in the second quarter, but it's worth remembering that prior to the housing crash, this would have been below the previous 60-year low for PFRI. As Carol will detail, we are raising our sales and earnings guidance for the year. The housing recovery should be a positive for our market, but we have difficult sales comparisons in the back half of the year as we anniversary hurricane events from 2012 and 2011, and very strong holiday seasons in both of those years. Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication. It is easy to talk about a flexible business model but the execution of that requires people willing to adjust to changed circumstances and deal with business challenges while putting the customer first. Our associates did that. Based on this facts results 100% of our U.S. stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates and we will have our highest ever Success Sharing payout. We are very proud of that result. With that let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter, posting positive comps in all departments. There were four key factors that drove our performance, strong summer events, a recovering seasonal business, commodity inflation and strength across the remainder of the store. The departments that had double-digit positive comps were kitchens, indoor garden, lumber, outdoor garden, lighting, tools, electrical and flooring. Bath, plumbing, decor, building materials, paint, hardware and millwork performed positively but were below the company average. Our seasonal business exceeded our plan, as Frank finally kicked into gear in the second quarter. We were able to recover all the lost sales we projected from exterior project categories in the first quarter and then some. In indoor and outdoor garden, our second quarter success resulted in positive comps in both departments for the first half of the year. The core of the store delivered solid sales growth throughout the second quarter. In maintenance and repair categories, we saw continued comp performance in light bulbs, wiring devices, cleaning, plumbing repair, fasteners, builder\u2019s hardware, caulk and adhesives. We also saw traction in decor categories where comps above the company average in special order carpets, special order cabinets, floor tile and lighting as well as strong comps in faucets. Our store associates did a great job executing our summer events and creating an excitement. Our Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July special buys and great values were well received by our customers and drove double-digit comps in categories like appliances and riding mowers. Our results were achieved through a coordinated effort between our supply chain, our merchants, our stores and our vendors. The investments we have made over the past several years gave us the flexibility and capability to respond quickly and meet spikes in demand. Total comp transactions rebounded from the first quarter and grew by 5.7% for the second quarter driven by traffic related to our seasonal business. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were up 3.8% for the second quarter, principally due to our garden business. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 15.5% in the second quarter driven by the strength in appliances, riding mowers, flooring as well as continued improvement from our pro business. Average ticket increased 4.3% in the second quarter. Our average ticket increase was impacted by commodity price inflation mainly from lumber and copper which contributed approximately 70 basis points to comp. As Frank mentioned, we had one of the best quarters in our recent history. As we look forward to the back half of the year, we are projecting solid sales growth but we do have several factors to overcome. First, we will face tough sales comparisons resulting from impacts of consecutive years of autumn storms. Second, commodity inflation is on track to no longer be tailwind as lumber and copper prices have begun to moderate. Third, we have began to the lap excellent response to our rollout of our expanded appliance business. As we get to the fourth quarter, the holiday shopping season, would be a week shorter due to the date on which Thanksgiving falls this year. Now let me talk specifically about the third quarter. We continue to focus on innovation as a key part our leadership strategy. In stores now, Behr Premium DeckOver wood and concrete coatings brings new life to old wood and concrete surfaces. This 100% acrylic formula available in 54 colors conceals splinters and cracks and creates a slip resistant finish. We continue to be innovative in lighting technology. As an example, we are introducing an LED 90-watt equivalent floodlight from Cree, now giving us a full range of assortment for the top-three most popular bulbs at market-leading values. For our pro customers, we are introducing DAP SMARTBOND adhesive foam gel that is faster and easier to use than traditional cartridge adhesives helping our pro customers to be more efficient. One cartridge of SMARTBOND provides eight times the coverage of traditional adhesives. Also, new to homedepot.com for our pro customers, we are offering a line of fully welded steel cabinets from Husky, which feature a variety of door and interior configurations. This allows the customer to customize their cabinets exactly the way they want. For our Labor Day and events we have an extensive lineup of great values and special buys. These events along with our superior execution in-store will generate a lot of excitement in the third quarter. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Craig. Hello, everyone. In the quarter, sales were $22.5 billion. On a like-for-like basis comps or same-store sales were positive 10.7% for the quarter with positive comps of 10.2% in May, 11.5% in June and 10.5% in July. Comps for US stores were positive 11.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 11.5% in May, 11.7% in June and 11% in July. Total sales grew 9.5% from last year reflecting the impact of the calendar shift. As you will recall, fiscal 2012 had a 53rd week, which shifted our fiscal 2013 calendar. By starting fiscal 2013, one week later than last year, we had one less week of spring sales in the second quarter when compared to the same period in 2012, which negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $249 million or 120 basis points. As Frank and Craig mentioned, our second quarter sales performance exceeded our expectations due in part to strong demand for appliances and recovery in our garden department. Further, sales related to hurricane Sandy were approximately $47 million in the second quarter. We expect to see some benefit from storm related sales in the second half of the year, but the year-over-year benefit will diminish as we begin lapping hurricane sales in the third quarter. Our total company gross margin was 34.3% for the quarter, an increase of 12 basis points from last year of which 13 basis points came from our US business. We saw a considerable amount of movement in our gross margin during the quarter as explained by the following. First, we experienced approximately 22 basis points of gross margin expansion due to the impact of gross margin accretive businesses that were acquired in the back half of last year. Second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion due to expense leverage within our supply chain. Third, our shrink efforts continued to gain traction as we realized 10 basis points of gross margin expansion due to better shrink performance than one year ago. Finally, we experienced approximately 32 basis points of gross margin contraction due primarily to a change in mix of products sold. To put this contraction into perspective, over 50% or 19 basis points came from a higher penetration of appliance sales than one year ago. For the first six months of the year, our gross margin grew by 16 basis points. As we look to the last six months of the year, we would expect our gross margin expansion to be about half of what we experienced in the first six months, so for the year expect moderate gross margin expansion. In the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 79 basis points to 20.9%. In the second quarter, our operating expenses grew at 58% of our sales growth, better than our expectations for the quarter due to strong sales performance. For the year, we are expecting our expenses to grow at approximately 30% of our sales growth on a 52-week basis. But note, like what we experienced in the second quarter, there will be quarterly distortion to that rule of thumb, given year-over-year comparisons and certain expense items like Success Sharing. For example, in the second quarter of 2013, over 300 stores were in higher Success Sharing payout tiers than one year ago. This caused 14 basis points of expense deleverage in the quarter. Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $172 million, a 13.9% increase from last year, reflecting increased interest expense associated with $2 billion of incremental debt issued in April of this year. Our income tax provision rate was 36.9% in the second quarter and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.24, an increase of 22.8% from last year. Moving to our operational metrics. During the second quarter, we opened one new store in Puerto Rico for an ending store count of 2,258. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 235 million and total sales per square foot were $383. Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $11.1 billion and inventory turns were 4.9 times, up from 4.7 times last year. We ended the quarter with $42.2 billion in assets including $3.4 billion in cash. Moving to our share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we received 2.1 million share related to the true up of an accelerated share repurchase or ASR program we initiated in the first quarter. Additionally, in the second quarter we repurchased $2.15 billion or 25.4 million of our outstanding share. This included 5.8 million shares repurchased in the open market and 19.6 million shares repurchased through an ASR program. For the shares repurchased under the second quarter ASR program, this is an initial calculation and we expect to receive an additional 2.4 million shares in August. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 19.1%, 310 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2012. We had solid first half, as evidenced by strong performance across our store. As we look to the back half, we believe we will continue to report solid sales gains and that sales will be higher than we originally planned. So today, we are lifting our 2013 sales and EPS growth guidance reflecting our first half performance and our forecast for the second half of the year. We now expect fiscal 2013 sales to increase by approximately 4.5% with positive comps on a 52 week like-for-like basis of approximately 6%. We expect the rate of comp growth for the back half of the year to be about 50% of the rate of comp growth we have experienced in the first half of the year. Our second half forecast is based on our view that we are in the early stages of housing recovery, that GDP will grow less than 2% for the year and reflects back half challenges that Craig detailed. Finally, we, like others, are watching the interest rate environment as consumer spending and mortgage availability could be negatively impacted if interest rates were to rise. In the absence of rising interest rate however, if there is a bias in our second half forecast today we would say there is more upside opportunity than downside risk. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now project fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 20% to $3.60. This earnings per share guidance includes the $4.3 billion of share repurchases completed in the first half of the year and our intent to repurchase an additional $2.2 billion in shares during the second half of the year. So we thank you for your participation in today's call and Marquita, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Carol, just following up on your comments near the end, you sounded more confident. Obviously the results should cause that confidence, but what causes that confidence going forward and what do you think competitively in terms of pricing or anything along those lines, because gross margin looks solid given this shift in mix.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Gary. We look at the number of factors both, internal and external to why that point of view as to how our sales will perform in the back half of the year coming off obviously a very strong first half of the year. The best thing we can look at our current trends and I will tell you the current trend of the business is good. Sales are quite brisk. Now, competitively, Craig, you might want to comment.\nCraig Menear: Gary, from a competitive standpoint, we saw the last quarter that we just exited pretty comparable. Most folks went hard after the seasonal business given the late start of the business and certainly and big ticket appears we still need to stimulate the customer to buy, but not a radical change and kind of we would expect that going forward.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: There has been a lot of talk our a lot of talk, and I will get off the phone, there has been a lot of talk about interest rates rising and the impact that could have on housing and you guys et, cetera. What are your thoughts on where we are?\nCarol Tome: Well, as you know through the year, mortgage rates are up. They are at the highest rate that they have been since October of 2011 at about 4.4%. The affordability index is still at historical high, Gary. So if rates were to move up, it would peak that affordability index, but we have got a long way to go before it should have a dramatic impact we believe mortgage availability or the attractiveness for the consumer or homeowner to take out a mortgage. All that being said, however we are watching it.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDan Binder - Jefferies: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on two things. One, on sort of the bigger ticket project business what you are seeing, kitchen and bath in particular and then also if you could comment on credit availability. I know you guys had started doing that program. Any color around that?\nCraig Menear: Dan, on the big ticket, we did see very nice strength in tickets above $900 growing at 15.5% in the quarter. That was largely driven with appliances things like riding mowers which were strong throughout the quarter. We saw flooring projects as well as our kitchen business, all contributed to that. Then certainly the continued strength of our pro business which carries a higher average ticket overall help that as well.\nCarol Tome: On the credit front, during the quarter we opened 1.4 million new private-label credit card accounts, so we were very pleased with that. The penetration of our private label card room 41 basis points in the quarter now outstanding at 22.6%, so that's the good news too. We also saw an increasing bank card, so it appears that consumers are willing to use our bank cards, our bank card penetration up 30 basis points year-on-year. If you look at what's going on within our private label portfolio, we see consumer approval rate hovering around 68%. That's good news too. because as you know, they were dropping as a result of some of the changes coming out Durbin, but now we see it hovering around 58%, the average line approved is $5,800. That's up $200 year-on-year at a FICO at about $716. On the commercial front, the average approval rate there is 70%. The line approved is $6,800. That also was $200 a year-on-year. We are coming behind our pro customers, because they are still very important (Inaudible) programs or we work with the underwriter to extend credit lines on a case-by-case basis. So, credit obviously is an important part. It's not the entire story here, but it is certainly part of the story.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Thanks and good morning. Can you talk about very consistent comps throughout the quarter, is there a way to think about what the seasonal business actually lifted perhaps July which was later in the quarter, but obviously have these record moistures levels out there and your mowing and cutting bushes and so forth, so is there a way to sort of peel that back and think about what July is ex-seasonal?\nCraig Menear: Yes. Chris, the seasonal business obviously carried strong throughout the quarter. We saw, for example in sales of things like power equipment remain very throughout the quarter including July, as you mentioned, due to the fact that we had a moist July that obviously kept the grass growing as well. When we look at the seasonal business in total, one of the risk factors coming off of the first quarter was whether or now you would be able to recover the whole live goods and fertilizer business and because of the moisture we actually were able to get all that business back and carrying through June and July and then actually some went above what we thought.\nCarol Tome: July was our easiest compare. So that's another way to parse it out, if you think about it that recovery of garden evened out but mostly performance.\nChristopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Okay. So, I guess you would say, like obviously guiding about 4% comp in back half of August is very strong but maybe the ex-seasonal or core underlying growth rate in the business is somewhere between that 4% and the 10% that you posted in July.\nCarol Tome: Well, just the way I would like you to think about the back half of the year, and I will walk you down from what we posted in the first half to the second half, and around. So in the first half, our comp was 8%-ish. I am rounding down. I am going to walk you down to the guidance that we are giving you which is about 4%-ish. First, we are up against some very tough hurricane sales and I would like you to think about this really on a two-year basis. We forget sometimes that we had a hurricane in 2011, Hurricane Irene. We had $360 million of hurricane related sales in 2011. Then if you move to 2012, we all know we had Hurricane Sandy but we also had Hurricane Isaac. So when you add up those sales, that's about $377 million of hurricane sales. So on a two-year basis, we were up against more than $730 million of sales coming off of hurricane. So one of the walk downs, obviously, would be, we are not anticipating hurricanes now. If we get a hurricane, it's a different story but right now we are not anticipating a hurricane. So not maybe a 1.5 point off of just hurricane related sales. Then, as Craig pointed out, commodity prices are starting to moderate. If you remember, the back half of last year, our structural planning pricing took off. Its now coming down. So we would knock off maybe a point, call it a 130 basis points for commodity price inflation. Then while we will have growth in categories like appliances, we don't anticipate the explosive growth that we had in the first half, just because we are anniversarying new brands. So knock off another 120 basis points, something like that and you get to the 4%.\nChristopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Understood, and then, one last question. Can you talk about what the SG&A impact in this quarter was, from a leverage perspective? How much the fact that it was driven by traffic versus ticket impacted leverage overall? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yes, well, first let me say, Marvin and our operations team have done a fantastic of managing payroll in our stores given the sight that we saw in our sales growth. We leveraged hourly payroll in the quarter. We leveraged hourly payroll by 38 basis points. So really excellent work there. There is just some year-over-year comparisons, Chris, that are distorting the performance in the second quarter and let me just give you some of that color. It might help you better understand the shape of the year. First of all, if you recall last year, we had a good guide coming from workers' comp in the amount of about $42 million. This was an actuarial reserve adjustment that we had last year. That did not repeat this year. Though it gave us some pressure on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, I called out the gross margin benefit of our newly acquired businesses. Well, they come with expenses too. So, on a year-over-year basis, we had $37 million of expenses from our newly acquired businesses that we didn't have one year ago. Now we will start to anniversary the acquisitions, if you will, towards the back half of the year. So our expenses become much more in line with the guidance that I have given you. The other thing I would like to call out, because are just so really excited about this for our store associates. As Frank pointed out, we will be paying record Success Sharing checks for our store associates. The year-over-year increase is $46 million and in fact is twice as much of what we paid in 2011. Chris?\nOperator: We will take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.\nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: Carol, quickly just on D&A. It is flat to down over the last few years but it's up, I think about 5%, year-over-year in the first half, so just a modeling question. What's driving that and how should we be thinking about the growth in D&A going forward.\nCarol Tome: Well, it's really a change in the mix of our capital spending. We spent a lot of our capital on new store that had long lives. We are now shifting our capital to sort of assts including IT. This year, we will spend about $435 million in IT the longest life we have got there is six years, so it's dragging off over three.\nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: Okay. If we think about the 6% comp that you guys have for this year, and let us assume that persists of the next couple of years going forward, is the OpEx growing 30% of sales, is that kind of a good benchmark to use or does it start to evolve as we lookout again assuming kind of a 6%-type comp?\nCarol Tome: Well, for modeling purposes, I think 30 basis points expense growth is the right number.\nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: Okay. Perfect. Then just for Craig. You talked about some of the core categories. Can you maybe talk about some of the real remodel categories and things like windows and things like that, are you starting to see kind of evidence of that kind of activity starting to pick up in the stores?\nCraig Menear: Yes. We are. We are starting to see, for example, in lumber not only that we have some inflation year-over-year, it was about 70 basis points of our comp coming as a result of that, but we also saw unit productivity which is our pro customer starting to comeback. Solid growth and things like fasteners and pneumatics all those are heavy pro-dominated categories.\nOperator: We will go next to Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: Thanks a lot for taking my question. First, within the product mix are you seeing any shift around from opening price points to better and best price points? Then I have a follow-up question.\nCraig Menear: Not a lot of change, Michael, in the line structure. The only thing I would point out on that is, we have had some really nice innovation and things like LED, which carry a higher ticket, certainly within the light bulb category we are seeing customer step-up, the [bear premium deck over] is a great product, so we are seeing customers willing to spend really in every segment of the category within a category whether that'd be opening price point, mid or high.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: Is it that because you are seeing customers across all price points come back, which maybe obscuring some of the trade up or is there just not really that willingness to trade up at this point?\nCraig Menear: No. Again, I think the innovation in many categories is what is driving the trade up, so customers are willing to step up and spend money when they see great innovation that either makes a project easier and/or like in the case of LEDs, saves them energy cost around the home. They are definitely willing to step up.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: Got it. Sorry. I was confused. The second question I had is, if you look on a like-for-like basis within product, and I recognize that you got 70 basis points inflation from commodity price increases, but how are prices trending on like-for-like non-commodity oriented products if you look back say a year ago.\nCraig Menear: I would say that our focus is relentless focus on driving value for the customer, wee are always looking to provide a better value, so we are working hard to drive unnecessary cost out whether that be working with our suppliers on how we can drive our cost. Obviously, supply chain is allowing us to leverage cost and we are looking to bring better value to our customer and reduce prices wherever we can.\nCarol Tome: If I could just jump in, because Craig mentioned this, I just want to reemphasize the point. We saw an increase in items in the basket this quarter. It contributed 20 basis points of growth to our ticket in the quarter. It has been a drag since the housing crisis, so we can't overstate the importance of what that means in terms of recovery both, for our pros of course, but as well as our DIY customers.\nOperator: We will go next to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: My primary question and then I have quick follow-up, just if you could talk about the evolution of your expanded appliance assortment. Talk about the pace of the rollout just to put in context and compare the rollout in-store to the rollout and penetration online? How far along do you think you are in realizing the benefits of this rollout process? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: Okay, Matt, at the end of the last year, we had rolled out about 120 stores with an extended appliance program. We added brands in the fall season. We added Samsung around the December time frame which got us to the full offering of brands that we have right now. We are in the process right now of expanding another 120 stores for, you know, an expanded showroom experience. All of those brands are available on homedepot.com and have been since last December. We are seeing very nice response from the customer.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: So to the extent that you guys cited this is a headwind for the year, it sounds like the roll out is not yet done. So do you think there could be some ongoing gains from incremental penetration to offset the fact that you had this in the year ago?\nCraig Menear: Well. I think we went at 120 stores last fall. Obviously, we are overlapping that. We started with some of our best stores where we felt we had the greatest opportunity. So we will see how that plays out.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Got it, and then my second question, I think, we have come at this maybe a couple of different ways. Is it possible to sort of put a number on the comp benefit that you think you captured just in terms of the shift in volume from Q1 to Q2?\nCarol Tome: Yes, we outperformed the guidance that we gave you by about $800 million and as we look at that outperformance, the combination of appliances and gardens made up 50% of that. Garden would have been $200 million of that.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Carol, when you talk comps, do you talk about for the first half of the year or for the second quarter, per se?\nCarol Tome: For the second quarter.\nOperator: We will go next to Greg Melich with ISI Group.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Carol, I wanted to ask on the SG&A to make sure I got this right.\nCarol Tome: Okay.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: The second quarter, you grew out expenses over a 50% of sales.\nCarol Tome: Yes.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: But you still expect for the year that it will grow to 30% or do you think in the second half it will get back to that 30% level? So that the full year you are still running above?\nCarol Tome: Our guidance is that the full year expenses will grow at 30% of our sales growth rate. Now, let's just think about it on a quarterly basis so we can get our models right. We guided off of GAAP. In the third quarter of last year, we had expenses associated with our China store closing. So in the third quarter of this year, our expenses will be under last year. Then in the fourth quarter, it will return to more normal. It could be more in 30% range. So, when you add it up for the year, it will be 30%.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Right, that's helpful. Thanks. Then a bigger picture question. Frank, it was in your prepared comments, you talked about getting one of every three online orders now down through the stores and one out of five by something else. Could you give us some benchmark of where that was a year ago and where you would like it to be or where you expect it to trend over the next year or two if we do things right.\nFrank Blake: So, Greg, we have just started this year with the rollout of buy online ship to store. Last year we had buy online pick up in store. So there has been a substantial increase in the penetration because of the addition of buy online ship to store and the improvement of buy online pickup in store. I would say, we don't have a specific target on what we would like to see. The customers are going to tell us but we think, as I said, that we want our stores to be a competitive advantage and we want the convenience of our stores to be something that our customers see as a value and we are seeing that now. We are really pleased with it. It puts a lot of pressure on Marvin and his team because we have got new product rolling into the stores that they have to be able to respond quickly to the customer desire to pick it up, but that's really one of our long-term sustaining competitive advantages we believe.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: If I could, if Marvin is there, just of the added labor hours, if you are kind of having to put in this quarter, was it all just related to just overall sales or was this a particular driver there?\nMarvin Ellison: Overall sales, but we have a very detailed analysis that we conducted at the beginning of the year trying to understand where Craig was investing in new merchandising categories, innovation and new products, as well as when we are forecasting sales, so to be specific we made labor investment in pro in two areas. Speed of check out, so we invested in our cash area. We also invested in loading. Pros want to get in and out buyer, so we made investments there. We made investments obviously in garden, because of just the overall sales trend and believe or not we made other investments just in a lot, because the transactions were at a record pace and we wanted to just provide assistance with loading and other departments throughout the store, so the overall business drove a lot of the investment but also just a penetration of businesses like pro allowed us to make incremental investments over and above just the overall business trends.\nOperator: We will go next to Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: My question, Carol, for you is kind help us walk through the third and fourth quarter sales guidance or how you would look at that? I know you walked us through the second half, but maybe you could go and parse some of those hurdles that you were facing by quarter during the second half?\nCarol Tome: I would be happy to. On the sales front, you should expect our comps to be in a fairly narrow range, so as regarding to let's say 4% for the back half of the year, that gives you an idea. They are going to be in a fairly narrow range. I have already talked about the expenses. Expenses should be lower in the third quarter and then trending more at our guidance of 30% of sales growth in the fourth quarter. I do want to pause and make sure everyone remembers that we had that extra week, so we got to axe that extra week out, (Inaudible) guidance here. The other thing I should comment on is, our gross margin performance. As we have looked out our gross margin rate up 16 basis points before the half and I guided that for the back half of the year it would be about half of that rate, or call it 8 basis points which translates to 12 basis points for the year. That's actually slightly under what we had planned at the beginning of the year, but it's purely a reflection of what our consumers are buying in our stores. We are doing a great job of managing what we control supply chain leverage, shrink leverage, cost out, but when a customer comes in and buys a lower margin product, we are going to take that sale all day long and it impacts our rate performance.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay. My follow-up question goes to kind of a appliances and cabinets. Do you have a market share number now for appliances that you could share with us? I know kitchen was up double digits as were appliances. I don't know if I heard cabinets in that.\nFrank Blake: Yes. Budd, on the appliance side as reported by independent third parties on a rolling-12, we are at about 11.8% in the industry, so we are still a [distant] and that's versus about 10 last year, Craig. Is that what I recall?\nCraig Menear: 10 unchanged.\nFrank Blake: Yes.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: So, up slightly?\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Cabinets, how are they performing?\nCraig Menear: Cabinets continue to do well. We had strong growth in our overall kitchen business, we offer a wide variety of options for our customers whether that would be in-stock cabinets, semi-custom, fully assembled and we did well on the quarter.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay. If I could just sneak one other quick one in, supply chain, Carol, you noticed that as a benefit. We haven't talked about that as much in recent quarters. What do you see going forward for that?\nCarol Tome: We expect to drive continued leverage in our supply chain. Mark Holifield and team continue to drive productivity improvements, our RDC network is becoming a mature network, but it doesn't stop there. As you know, we are investing in direct fulfillment facilities, the transportation play it will help lower our transportation cost, not because cost of the supply chain transportation. Everything that Mark and team are doing, not just running better facilities, but managing the optimization of transportation should help us grow. As you know when we set out our roadmap to the 12% operating margin by 2015, supply chain was in that roadmap looking at a 20 basis points benefit.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: It seem to be though outperforming that now.\nCarol Tome: Well. With a double-digit positive comp.\nCraig Menear: But in 2012, we have picked up three of that, so there is about 17 to go between now and 2015.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Congratulations again. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: We will go next to Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Hi. Thank you. Carol, could you just detail what the appliance benefit was to comp both, in the quarter and the first half of the year?\nCarol Tome: Well, the appliance benefit to the quarter was 80 basis point. Year-on-year, plenty of that number, I know that appliances are up $307 million year-on-year for the half, but I don't know what the comp is.\nCraig Menear: Yes.\nCarol Tome: We will look back into it.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Yes, okay, got it. Then Frank, I guess just big picture, when you see double-digit comps come to the store and even if you think about 8% for the first half of the year, being much stronger than probably what it was a year ago, does it change the way that you think about the recovery and what the stores can handle on what this recovery could look like if the housing markets keeps unfolding?\nFrank Blake: I split that into two parts. First what our stores can handle and then second, the broader comment on the market recovery. In terms of what our stores can handle, as I said in my comments, really an extraordinary job done by our store associates, our supply chain team, our merchants and our vendors to respond to a much sharper increase in sales than we expected and as I said again in my comments, it's easy to say you have a flexible business model. That puts a lot of pressure on you and when you just look at the inventory performance, the leverage and payroll as well as the sales, we are really pleased with our ability to respond flexibly. In terms of the overall market recovery, as Carol said, in terms of what's underneath our guidance for the year is the housing market is clearly an assist to us. That was something we saw in the second quarter. We saw through the first half. We expect that to continue in the back half. There are some things we are watchful of, but we expect it to continue. Then we have some specific things within our business that moderate that and both Carol and Craig detailed those.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: On the part of that, as far as how the business responded to the strong comps? Would you say that's better than you expected to be or met your expectation?\nFrank Blake: Yes, better. I would welcome my colleagues here to speak because I think it was a difficult quarter. It's kind of the difficulty that you want to have. You want to be challenged by sales but it required a lot of flexibility and responsiveness.\nCarol Tome: Well, some of us were here last time we did a double-digit positive comp and our execution wasn't like it was today.\nMarvin Ellison: Dennis, this is Marvin, and Frank said it well, would just remind people, we don\u2019t increased dock doors or receiving space. We had record transactions and the associates, the merchants, the supply chain deserves a lot of credit. Managing payroll and environment was tricky but we have a new payroll system that Matt Carey and IT team helped us design about 18 months ago and it worked perfectly. So we are very proud. We kept our net promoters score year-over-year relatively flat over 70, which any other time wouldn't be pleased we were flat but in a record transaction quarter, we feel pretty good about the service levels for all of the transactions and customers and freight that we had to deal with. So are very pleased.\nCraig Menear: That's all I would like to add to. I will be remiss if I didn't call up the fact that between our inventory plan and replenishment team, our merchants working with our suppliers, our suppliers did an awesome job of working with us to make sure that product was flowing and be able to take care of the demand spikes. We couldn't have done it without them.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: So can you handle a 20% comp?\nCraig Menear: We would like to try.\nFrank Blake: Yes, we would like to give it a shot.\nCarol Tome: Absolutely.\nOperator: We will go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer: A big picture question. Carol, I want to go back. You commented at the end of your prepared remarks that interest rates is a fact that you are watching. So I think now in the retail community, higher interest rates is the latest Boogeyman which could derail spending here. So the question I have for you is, as you think of Home Depot where, if interest rates start to have an impact on the business, where would you see it? Then, as a follow up to that is, and just to be clear, with interest rates having really ticked up a bit here, have you seen any indications thus far of the skittishness on the part of your consumers as a result of that?\nCarol Tome: So let me ask or answer the latter part of your question first. As we look at the health in drivers that impact our business, really looking at turnover and home prices, and as you have known, we have seen a nice increase year-on-year in both of those. We think, based on forecast for both housing and turnover, that that will drive about 250 basis points of our overall growth this year. Now, how do interest rates come into play for prices or turn over? Well, if you can't get financing then you can't get things to move so it could have an impact. We certainly haven't seen that to-date, so we have tried to do a lot of modeling and correlations to say well what would happen if rates went up another 100 basis points and another 200 basis points. We are not seeing anything that we can point out to as aha it is was a big learning, but just our intuition would tell us consumer psyche can change in a higher interest rate environment, so we want to be cautious.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer: Is there any historical pressure if you look at Home Depot through various interest rate cycles as to what point higher interest rates could actually impact the business?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: If you go back through time in higher interest rate cycles, we are often time powered through those cycles, so. No.\nOperator: We will go next to Kate McShane with Citigroup.\nKate McShane - Citigroup: Good morning. A lot of questions have been answered, so this is a little bit more smaller question, but I wondered if you could go into a little bit more detail about what you are seeing from the smaller pro customer. You highlighted you have seen an improvement, but have we seen an inflection with this group and are they comping positively?\nCraig Menear: First, Kate, I will turn it to Marvin to respond more fully, but yes they are positively comping and the rate of growth is improving. It's not at the same rate of growth as our larger spending pros, but that is actually consistent with how we thought this would develop, but, yes, it's positive and strong.\nMarvin Ellison: Kate, the point I will add to that is, when we dissect the data understanding why the larger pro is growing at a more robust rate, a lot of times it comes down to liquidity and just access the capital. These smaller pros are remaining same, we were very pleased with their performance in the quarter and just pleased with all the partnership with the merchants in getting the products in the prices that they want. As I mentioned earlier, we made payroll investments on that side of the building, because they told us for years they want to get in and out fast, they want to us to help them grow their business and we think because of the investment in payroll from a loading, from a service and some of the customer service initiatives we put in place and things as simple as dedicated parking, which doesn't appear to be important with your customer, where time is money, those things are very critical. We are pleased with the growth and we hope that we continue to see it.\nDiane Dayhoff: Marquita, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We will take our last question from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Two questions. One, following up on the appliances you had 120 stores and you said you are doing another 120. That's still only putting in little more than 10% of the store base is. Is that the right number longer-term, or is it something that you continue to put that jumbo set in more and more stores over time?\nCraig Menear: I mean, our intent will be to continue to evaluate the opportunity as we go forward.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: I assume these are just better stores, but is there something specific about these 240 or so stores that make the appliance work there that wouldn't work elsewhere?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: No. As you can appreciate, when we went into this, we looked at some of our highest volume stores and those two were close clients competitor. As we look ahead, we want to make sure that any incremental investment that we make will be value create.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: One more just on leverage and where you are right now, I think you are just under your benchmark of 2.0 times. Earlier in the year, you talked about potentially taking on more leverage. I think you had said it in December if memory serves or later in the year. Where do you stand right now with your outlook on debt?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio stands at 1.7 times against cap, if you will, at two times. That gives us about $3.4 billion of borrowing capacity as we stand today. We do have $1 billion in a quarter that comes due in December, and so we will take a look at whether or not we want to raise incremental financing at that time.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: Above and beyond what's due?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you to everyone who has joined us today. We look forward to talking to your next quarter.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-05-21 12:30:14", "content": "Executives: Diane Dayhoff - Vice President, IR Frank Blake - Executive Chairman and CEO Craig Menear - Executive Vice President, Merchandising Carol Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial officer Marvin Ellison - Executive Vice President, U.S. Stores\nAnalysts: Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates Gary Balter - Credit Suisse Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company David Gober - Morgan Stanley Christopher Horvers - J.P.

And welcome to today\u2019s Home Depot First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator instructions) Beginning today\u2019s discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you, Mary and good morning to everyone. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, chairman and CEO of the Home Depot; Craig Menear, executive vice president of merchandising; Carol Tom\u00e9, chief financial officer and executive vice president, corporate services. Following our prepared remarks the call will be open for analyst questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors, and as a reminder, we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up, please. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Now, before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane. And I would like to start by saying our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been stricken by the violet storms in Oklahoma and throughout the Southwest. Our company and our associates are part of these communities, so we will be working hard to be helping in the days and weeks ahead.  Now on our results, sales for the first quarter were $19.1 billion, up 7.4% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.3% and our diluted earnings per share were $0.83. Our US stores had a positive comp of 4.8%. All three of our US divisions posted positive comps for the quarter. For our northern division in particular this was a significant accomplishment given the dramatic difference between the unusually warm spring of 2012 and the relatively cold spring of 2013. Our western division was our best performing division driven by double-digit positive comp in most of the major markets in California. Our Florida markets also performed well with comps above the company average.  Internationally, our Canadian business had positive comp for the sixth quarter in a row and our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comp making it 38 quarters in a row of positive comp growth. As Craig will detail, while weather negatively impacted our seasonal and exterior businesses, our core interior project business remained strong throughout the quarter. This was encouraging and consistent with the view that the housing market is starting on the path to recovery. For the first time in the last several years the growth rate in our pro customer segment outpace the growth rate in the consumer segment. We\u2019ve been tracking the relative growth rates of our pro and consumer segment, as one indicator of the housing recovery. Since 2008, our pro segment has underperformed our consumer segment, last year the relative growth rates grew closer and in the fourth quarter of 2012, they grew at approximately the same pace. Our expectation was that the pro business would accelerate during the housing recovery and so this quarter\u2019s outperformance from the pro segment is a positive sign. Some of the outperformance was due to the slower growth in our consumer-oriented garden business, but even adjusting for that, the pro segment had a higher growth rate. Also our smaller spend pro customers contributed more significantly to the overall pro growth than in the last few years. Our expectation was that we see improve performance in the smaller spend pros as the housing market recovers, so this is another positive sign. Our services business had double-digit growth in the quarter and we are pleased with the integration of Measurecomp and U.S. Home Systems, our two recent services-related acquisitions. Marvin and his team have been able to improve the customer experience both in the home and in the store by bringing these businesses directly into Home Depot. As part of our interconnected retail strategy, we have completed the rollout of buy online, ship to store. This required an effort across our business from supply chain to merchandising to online to IT and store operations. Our customers now have access to over 300,000 items available for pick up at their convenience in our stores. So far the growth we\u2019ve seen from this has been ahead of our expectations and one out of five customers who pick up and order at the store also buys an additional item over there. We also continued our efforts to improve the overall dotcom experience for our customers. We simplified our checkout process, refresh lending pages and integrated e-receive into the site among other key activities. We are pleased that the online traffic to our site was up almost 50% and as part of that not surprisingly mobile traffic more than doubled. The U.S. macro data on housing continues to improve, private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP picked up for the sixth consecutive quarter to 2.7%, increasing household formation, price appreciation and higher housing turnover are all positives for our market, but credit availability remains tight and constrains the velocity of the recovery. Last year at our Investors and Analysts Conference we set out a framework for thinking about the recovery of the housing market and the impact the recovery would have on us. In 2010 and 2011, we went through a period when our sales were growing but the housing market was still down or thus stabilizing. Our sales performance correlated most directly to overall GDP. Last year we had an additional modest resist from housing as the market started to improve. We saw that carry through in this past quarter somewhat stronger than we anticipated at or adjusting for weather impacts. As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are therefore revising upwards both our sales and earnings guidance for the year. We remain focused on taking care of our customers and investing in our business and in our associates. I\u2019d like to thank our associates for their hard work and dedication. Based on this quarter\u2019s results, roughly 98% of our stores would be in success sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. Last year we had 100% of our U.S. stores make success sharing, our objective is to accomplish that again this year. And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter with strength in our business across the breath of the store. We had positive comps in all departments, except our indoor and outdoor garden departments. The departments that outperform the company\u2019s average comp were kitchens, lumber, tools, plumbing, d\u00e9cor, electrical, bath, flooring, lighting and hardware. Paint, millwork and building materials performed positively while comp sales in indoor and outdoor garden were negative. Spring arrived at various times across the country and we were ready when it broke. In the western division where weather was more normal we had positive performance in all departments throughout the quarter. In contrast, in the northern and southern divisions where weather was significantly colder than a year ago, spring gardening and outdoor entertainment categories posted negative comps in February and March. But as the weather improved in April, our nimble supply chain and partnership with our store operations and field merchandising teams reacted quickly and maximized demand spikes.  By taking advance of this moment of opportunity we were able to post positive performance in our garden business across all divisions in April. Inside the home, we continued to gain momentum in sample d\u00e9cor. In flooring, customers\u2019 response to our SoftSpring carpet, new floor tiles and fusion grout helped drive department comp above the company average.  In bath, our lineup of Moen and Delta Foundations faucets as well as new vanities from Glacier Bay were the drivers of our performance. We continued to see strong results in lighting as customers transitioned to LED bulbs and light fixtures.  In maintenance and repair categories, we continued to see strength with comps above the company average in wiring devices, safety and security, plumbing repair, pipe and fittings, tools, hand tools, power tool accessories, cleaning and door locks.  Total comp transactions grew by 0.1% for the quarter overcoming significant downward pressure from our seasonal business. Transactions for tickets under $50 representing approximately 20% of our US sales were down 1.6% for the first quarter, principally due to our garden business. In contrast, in the month of April we were able to drive positive transactions, including tickets under $50. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our US sales were up 9.7% for the first quarter. Average ticket increased 5% in the first quarter. The drivers behind our average ticket growth were the strength in appliances as well as continued improvement from our pro business. Our average ticket increase was also impacted somewhat by commodity price inflation mainly from lumber and copper which contributed approximately 120 basis points to comp. Now let me turn our attention to the second quarter. We are introducing new technology in paint from Behr's with our new line of MARQUEE Exterior Paint and Primer. This new paint creates a tough non-stick surface that resists dirt and offers advanced state performance for longer-lasting color all backed by lifetime guarantee. Our exclusive MARQUEE paint resists rain showers as early as 60 minutes after application and can be applied in lower temperatures, which are great features for our pro customers.  Also in paint for our professional customer, we are introducing new paint sprayers from Graco. We have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys as well as innovative products for Memorial Day. We are introducing the first battery-powered trimmer that converts to a corded trimmer that you never run out of power from RYOBI.  In store now we have the [Pennington\u2019s feed] Behr\u2019s system. Without measuring, pouring or mixing the system delivers even feeding every time and puts up more nutrients than competing products while using less water. For Father's Day and 4th of July events, we also have an extensive lineup of great value and special buys. These events along with our superior execution in the stores will generate a lot of excitement in the second quarter.  And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9 : Thank you, Craig and hello everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $19.1 billion, a 7.4% increase from last year. As you will recall, fiscal 2012 had a 53rd week which shifted our fiscal 2013 calendar. By starting fiscal 2013 one week later than last year, we had an additional week of spring sales. The calendar shift contributed approximately 320 basis points of year over year sales growth.  On a like for like basis, comps or same-store sales were positive 4.3% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.6% in February, negative 3.5% in March and positive 9.9% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 4.8% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.8% in February, negative 3% in March and positive 10.8% in April. The monthly variation in our comp was due primarily to weather which impacted our garden department as well as the timing of Easter. As Craig mentioned, every department with the exception of our garden department reported a positive comp in the quarter. Sales related to Hurricane Sandy were approximately $145 million in the second quarter, $30 million higher than the storm sales we realized from Hurricane Irene in the same period last year. As the rebuilding continues, we believe we will see some additional storm-related sales in the second quarter. Our total company gross margin was 34.9% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from last year. This gross margin expansion came from our U.S. business and can be attributed to the following. First, our shrink efforts are gaining traction as we realized 11 basis points of gross margin expansion due to better shrink performance than one year ago. Second, we experienced approximately 20 basis points of gross margin expansion due to the impact of recently acquired businesses, which are gross margin accretive. And third, we experienced approximately 10 basis points of gross margin contraction due to a change in mix of products sold. For the year, we continue to expect moderate gross margin expansion. In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 112 basis points to 24%. Total operating expenses grew at a factor of 35% of our sales growth, better than our original guidance due principally to the sales environment. Interest in other expense was $161 million for the first quarter, an increase of $77 million over the same period last year due to the following factors. First, in the first quarter of 2012, we had a $67 million benefit arising from the termination of a third-party loan guarantee that did not repeat in 2013. And second, our net interest expense was $10 million higher than last year due for the most part to interest associated with $2 billion of incremental debt issued in April of 2013. Our income tax provision rate was 36.6% in the first quarter and we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37% for the year. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.83, an increase of 22.1% from last year. Moving to our operational metrics, during the first quarter we opened one new store in Mexico for an ending store count of 2,257. At the end of the first quarter, selling square footage was 235 million. And total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $328, up 7.8% from last year. Now, turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, inventory was $11.8 billion, up approximately 2% from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.4 times, up from 4.3 times last year. We ended the quarter with $44.2 billion in assets, including $4.3 billion in cash. In the first quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion or approximately 27.2 million shares of outstanding stock, including point 9.1 million shares through open market repurchases and 18.1 million shares through an accelerated share repurchase program. The shares acquired under the accelerated share repurchase program are an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon completion of the program in the second quarter. In April, we issued $2 billion of long-term debt at a record low blended coupon of 3.45%. At the end of the quarter, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times against a target of two times, giving us approximately $2 billion in additional borrowing capacity. We have no plans to issue incremental debt in the second quarter but if conditions warrant, we may look to do so in the back half of the year. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 17.7%, 230 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Continued strong performance in the core of our store drove first quarter sales ahead of our plan. Further we know that some garden sales that were deferred in the first quarter will be realized in the second quarter. Finally while the forecast for GDP growth in the US hasn't changed materially, housing continues to recover. Today we are looking our 2013 sales and earnings-per-share growth guidance reflecting our first quarter outperformance and our forecast for the second quarter where we are projecting sales and earnings to be higher than what we originally planned.  Because it is early in the year, we are not changing our forecast for the back half of the year. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2013 sales to increase by approximately 2.8% with positive comps on a 52-week like to like basis of approximately 4%. Given our updated sales growth guidance we now expect expenses to grow at 30% of our sales growth rate on a 52-week basis.  For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP, we now project fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 17% to $3.52. This earnings-per-share guidance includes the $2.1 billion of share repurchases completed in the first quarter and our intent to repurchase an additional $4.4 billion in shares over the course of the year.  So we thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Mary, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: I guess first question, I think it was a couple of years ago, you had mentioned an REO turnkey program for banks on the foreclosure side and I think that business is probably still growing and you\u2019ve got an emergence of single family rental companies out there as well that are going to be a little bit more institutional and maybe national, can you talk big picture kind of what that program looks like today and how you guys are thinking about maybe agreements that create a chance on the maintenance on the single family part of the business on the rental side?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well I will start, Marvin, you want to kick in. We are pleased with this business. On a relative basis, Dennis, it\u2019s a pretty small for us but we are seeing nice growth and we will continue to use our services to expand this across the country. What we\u2019re more excited about actually is what Frank commented on is the strength in our pro business. And this REO would not be inside of that pro business necessarily but we\u2019re really excited in that regard. Marvin, any color you want to add?\nMarvin Ellison: Dennis, the only thing I will add is as you know the business is shifting from traditional foreclosures with banks to a private equity funds are going in and purchasing up groups of properties. So we are shifting and adjusting but I think Carol\u2019s point is most important. This is a small business. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very interested in, we think that we have unique competencies with our pro business, with the products that we sell and our key is really two things. Leveraging our GC network that we have because we are in the services business and the pro business but also leveraging product pull-through, we want those customers to come to our stores to buy products, and those products to be the fixtures, faucets, the plumbing suppliers et cetera that we put in those homes from a remodel and from a maintenance standpoint. So far so good but it is a relatively small business. \nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Roughly how big would that be?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We haven\u2019t disclosed that Dennis.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Second question, as you talked about double-digit comps in California for the quarter, can you go into a little bit of details as far as categories that you see driving that performance and then maybe Frank, just big picture how you think about that maybe being a leading indicator to other parts of the country as home price inflation gains momentum as well?\nFrank Blake: Well, let me take the latter first. What we have seen over the last several quarters is some of our hard hit markets, the markets that were really ground zero of the housing collapse recover and that\u2019s California, Florida, moving into Arizona, now even Las Vegas and Nevada. So it\u2019s really part of how badly those markets suffered previously and now starting to return to more normal performance. I\u2019ll let Craig and Marvin comment, but I\u2019m not aware of any particular differences in terms of what\u2019s being sold in those markets, we are really selling across the store there.\nMarvin Ellison: Yeah. Really is broad based when you look at virtually every department we have, all posted positive growth in the California area, so we are very, very pleased that\u2019s it\u2019s a broad base sales pattern?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: You are just saying the rising title of floor boards the entire business is lifting.\nFrank Blake: Correct.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Very bullish. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Thank you. I\u2019ve just two questions. One is could you talk about, you did -- you\u2019re doing these different tests with PayPal and other ways of servicing the customer from a payment point of view? Could you just discuss where you\u2019re going with that and what\u2019s been the results of some of the tests and what are you rolling out et cetera?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, on the PayPal front, we are very pleased with the year-over-year performance, it actually doubled in penetration, particularly it\u2019s very, very small. We brought PayPal into our business because our customers wanted to use that as a form of standard and so we\u2019re delighted to have the relationship with them. As we look ahead, we set our eyes wide open as to what may be available to retailers from a mobile wallet perspective and there are a number of things that are being talked about as you know, there is a consortium of retailers. We are not part of that consortium, but we are watching what they are doing as [MCS], we\u2019re watching what they\u2019re doing. Obviously, we\u2019re watching what Google is doing. There was announcement about Google. So our eyes wide open. We want to be where the customer is going. We don\u2019t necessarily want to lead the way.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Okay. And lows being part of that consortium doesn\u2019t really impact your decisions, right?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Eyes wide open. We want to do the right thing for our customers.\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Okay. Okay. And the second question, your productivity now by assuming the calculation which was about 326 per square foot you detailed about $100 higher back in the good old days and just comping in the high singles you are going to get near there. As you look at your staffing the stores and the way the store is set, do you have -- do you feel like you could, the capacity is fine for getting up to those levels or do you feel that maybe you will start stretching your stores again and you have to start changing the way you come to market level?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, it really depends on the nature of the sales growth. As you know, we forecast sales growth 50% coming from transactions, 50% coming from ticket growth. As you saw on the first quarter, our growth came from ticket growth that has an impact on our staffing model, because it\u2019s an activity-based staffing model, but marketing depends tons of flexibility to do what you need to do with certain customers.\nCraig Menear: Yeah. Gary, we do, in fact, if you go back to the whole 60/40 initiative, over the last four years we\u2019ve reinvested roughly 500 hours per store per week back to the stores for service and that\u2019s reallocation not an incremental add, so that\u2019s really allowed us to continue to sustain a service level while making sure that we respond to the needs of the business. But I think Carol\u2019s point is very key and that is we have an activity-based system, driven by transactions in ticket. So where sales are picking up our staffing has increased. We think we will be in a perfect position to keep up with the trends. We work hand in hand with Craig\u2019s team. So as we forecast events, new product introductions, we will adjust our staffing to make sure we have customers served in a most appropriate way. So we feel really good about the future and how we can keep up with business.\nFrank Blake: Gary, the one other point that I\u2019d add to that on the store, we\u2019re faced with the size of our store, we don\u2019t see a need to substantially remodel our stores or expand them. But one thing that we\u2019re dealing with between Marvin and our supply chain team is buy online pickup in store as -- and buy online ship to store and buy online ship to store particularly that we\u2019ve had some pretty good customer interest in that and so we\u2019re thinking about how do we segment parts of the store to more efficiently serve that customer who is coming in and has bought online and just wants to pick it up from the store. So Marvin and his team are working on to what would we do with the store layout but that\u2019s a slight operation, it\u2019s not a remodel.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It\u2019s really interesting statistics. If you look at the first quarter 22% of the sales based online were actually picked up in the store and 10% of those were boss related buy online ship store related, isn\u2019t that interesting?\nGary Balter - Credit Suisse: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Aram Rubinson.\nAram Rubinson - Nomura Securities: A question about traffic and ticket, I see the quarter\u2019s entire comp was as you say came from ticket. There were a number of factors though that might have influenced that through the extra week shift and the weather and other things, can you help us disaggregate some of those factors, trying to get a sense of how the underlying traffic is on a reported basis underlying traffic on a comp basis was slightly negative. So just trying to get a little context on that.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I can start and Craig, you can add some color. Our comp transactions under 20 were up 0.1%, and that\u2019s a good number given how we are so heavily penetrated in garden in the first quarter. Our garden business makes up 18% of our total sales. If you look at our comp average ticket, it was up 4.2% year on year and if you look at the drivers, it was across all categories. As Craig pointed out, we had about 120 basis points coming from commodity inflation. We had about 70 basis points of growth coming from appliances, so our appliance business is growing quite nicely and then the rest is across all categories. Craig, do you want to give a more color?\nCraig Menear: Yeah, just to reiterate when we got into April and actually began to see a more normalized weather pattern, we were able to actually drive the transaction growth in the company and with the garden businesses kicking in and getting into positive growth in the month of April, it significantly helped that including the lower ticket categories which grew as well. \nAram Rubinson - Nomura Securities: So usually in a cyclical rebound we see ticket lead to comp, is that just part of what we are seeing naturally or do you expect the traffic to kind of be balanced with the ticket in the year ahead?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: So we would expect the traffic to come back in the second quarter of course because the sales that we didn\u2019t get in the first quarter have not been lost. And as we look at our garden sales, recall last year we had a really warm first quarter. So we pulled forward about $160 million of garden sales into the first quarter last year. This year we estimate we lost about $188 million of garden sales. But it\u2019s not lost forever, some of it\u2019s lost. But we are going to get the majority of that back in the second quarter and with that comes people.\nFrank Blake: I think the other factor when you think about the growth in ticket as we called out over $900, being up 9.7% improvement in the pro business is also a factor there, that\u2019s helping to drive that higher ticket. While we are not back to historical norms, we\u2019re seeing improvement in terms of unit productivity and the number of items in a basket with our pro customer. And so that\u2019s encouraging for us as well.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDan Binder - Jefferies & Company: I was wondering if you could just give us your best thoughts on what the -- when the seasonal shifts will occur with, I should say the week shift that occurred in Q1, how that plays out across the rest of the year? And then my second question was just regarding competition both online and on-land, how that\u2019s booking these days?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure. So let\u2019s talk about this seasonal shift and I am going to do it on a comp basis. So for the first quarter we told you that the seasonal shift to our 320 days is planned on a comp basis instead of the dollars that was $554 million. And looking at the second quarter, we will actually have a lower comp basis and it will be lower by about $300 million. So if you think about what that means, our comps will be higher in the second quarter than our total sales growth. Then looking to the third quarter there should be any meaningful difference in the comp basis and then finally in the fourth quarter our comp basis should decline by about $100 million, you can call it pretty flat. So hoping that\u2019s helpful.\nCraig Menear: And as far as the competition really it\u2019s still there. We have plenty out there, kind of haven\u2019t seen anything dramatically different in the last quarter but clearly we monitor what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and then adjust according to what we see happening. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from David Gober from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Gober - Morgan Stanley: Hi, guys. I was just wondering. Good morning, guys. And Craig, I was just wondering if you could touch a little bit on some of the merchandizing initiatives, particularly on the localization front as you ramp into the busy part of the year and you have update on, on what you\u2019re seeing there and how you are expecting that to impact the business, whether that would be contributing kind of ticket or traffic?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. Dave, we have, as you know, we\u2019ve put tools in place to assist our merchants and assorting. We are working on actually delivering enhancements to those capabilities right now. We have been developing clusters. So working to do a better job of assorting locally, following example that would be adjustments in floor tile mix and we had pretty nice performance. So we believe that by working with our field merchandizing team in conjunction with the merchants here in Atlanta that those kind of adjustments are paying off for us and see it in the performance.\nDavid Gober - Morgan Stanley: And maybe just a follow up on the appliance business, I know Carol mentioned that that continues to be strong and seem like in the fourth quarter that was a big part as you guys expanded a couple of relationships with vendors? And are you still seeing momentum there and as you continue to roll that out, and are you seeing the impact across the stores that more localize the appliance section?\nFrank Blake: First of all, we said, we are pleased with the performance that we are seeing in the appliance business as we call out it contributed about 70 basis points of comp in the quarter. Our customers are responding to the expanded offering. We completed the initial rollout of our expanded store base, which was 120 stores at the end of last year and we are moving forward, as we call out last quarter with an additional 120 stores. The appliance business is an interesting business, it\u2019s highly repair-oriented, a lot of appliances break every day in the country. So, we do see that as a big repair business. It also does complete the kitchen. So there is an opportunity on both sides.\nDavid Gober - Morgan Stanley: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: And will take our next question from Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan.\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Thanks and good morning. Carol, I believe you mentioned 18% of sales is historically, you said garden in the first quarter, what was that this year, how does that compared to 2Q? And perhaps, can you expand that bucket, how much would you say is seasonal and outdoor broadly historically in the first and second quarter, including things like grills, patio, furniture and outdoor paint and all the outdoor activities?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, the 18% number that I shared with you was the penetration this year and as we pointed out, our comps were negative. So obviously the penetration was higher last year, slightly higher. And Craig you might want to talk about how we categorize?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. In terms of outdoor kind of categorizes in total as we look at it, generally in Q1 that represents about 30% of our business and it grows to about 35% of our business in Q2\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: And then, okay, and so, I assume last year that was a lot higher in the first quarter is it 2 or 300 basis points higher, the flip year-to-year or is it something smaller?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, if you just want to give us a second we can tell you. So the penetration has changed about 200 basis points year-on-year.\nChristopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan: 200 bps year-to-year, okay. So, you are raising the guidance for the, you are just raising, assuming that the season -- the seasonal business shift into the second quarter from the first, the 100 -- I think the $180 million that you mentioned, you missed this year that\u2019s about 90 basis point, should we look at that the 2Q outlook on the stock basis or we just going to sort of assume that the foray domestically, and I get the 90 bps back of that garden business shifting or is another 200 basis points from the seasonal shift, total outdoor seasonal shift?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, let me share with you how we\u2019re thinking about it. Our -- the guidance that we\u2019ve given today, the lift from 2 to 2.8 on comp basis 3 to 4, equates to about $800 million more in sales than we originally planned. Of that $800 million about $340 million was recognized in the first quarter. So that balance we believe will come in the second quarter. And we did that the following way. First is recovery of garden and we won\u2019t recover everything we lost but we will recover the majority. We also believe that we will have additional sales from Sandy and this will all be incremental. So we are projecting $80 million from Sandy and I will tell you that is a projection. Don't really know. And then the rest will come from strength across the core of the business. It\u2019s May 21, our sales thus far in the month are great. So we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we\u2019ve given.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: I actually have two. First, it\u2019s on the floor of the credit to consumers, how are you viewing that dynamic within the broader macro environment as influencing your sales, is that starting to happen, what\u2019s the driver, or do you expect that, that\u2019s still on the horizon that will happen down the road?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: So Michael, the question is on consumer credit?\nMichael Lasser - UBS: Yes, is it starting to flow -- we saw in the fourth quarter home equity line was down year over year. What do you is fostering all this good growth that you are seeing?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well interestingly we did see improved penetration on our private label cards. In the quarter the penetration increased 119 basis points to 22.9%. And if we look by category where we saw that growth it was driven by our kitchen departments, our millwork departments and our plumbing departments, some of our strongest year-over-year growth departments. So that\u2019s good news. I will tell you our approval rates continue to decline principally because people are coming off the sidelines which lower FICO scores and they're not being followed by. So our approval rates were about 65% down from last year slightly. The average FICO score being improved to 7/10 of an average credit line of $5800. The other interesting statistic that for our existing customers, they are only about 27% utilized on their credit. So consumers continue to be pretty cautious with credit. This thing holds true for pro. Our pro approval rates were about 70%, a bit of a higher line there $6800 but only 20% utilized. Now on the consumer side, as you know the ability to pay or the card act really negatively impacted approval. The consumer financial protection bureau came out with some changes recently which we think will help approval rate. We think it will help grow our approval rate 500 basis points more or less. So that\u2019s good news. This is my long answer to your question but much like the housing market beginning to recover the consumer and credit availability is beginning to recover but it\u2019s not recovered.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: And it sounds like you are doing your part to contribute to the free flow of credit to the consumer?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, we are.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: And my second question is, as housing recovery continues the profitability of the supply chain should improve, or the entire home-improvement supply chain should improve as capacity utilization rates rise. Are you starting to see evidence that you\u2019re benefiting from that and whatever capacity you might --\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well as you know, we\u2019ve given guidance through 2015 which we judge we will get about 20 basis points of benefit from our supply chain by 2015. Didn\u2019t see that in the first quarter but that\u2019s just because of the nature of the seasonal business, IT sales and our supply chain did a great job in the first quarter. But longer term we should enjoy far more benefits.\nMichael Lasser - UBS: I wasn\u2019t necessarily talking about your supply chain, sorry for the confusion, I was talking about your vendors becoming more profitable such that you would start to participate in their improved profitability?\nFrank Blake: Certainly when you can put throughput through the factories, that improves overall profitability and we do have agreements in place with our suppliers where as we drive productivity for them we ensure that productivity and obviously can deliver greater value for our customers as well.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: You spoke about the strengths in your commercial business and macro dynamic, commercial business and you attributed that part to macro dynamics, which clearly working in your favor. When we\u2019ve been talking to pros over the past months about the power center channel supplying to them? Home Depot often stands out, is taking more aggressive action and making incremental -- having incremental impacts? So is it possible to try to disaggregate you think the contributions of your own changes and you might talk about anyone that are new or different or making a big difference versus that of the market in driving that pro business above the consumer business here in the first quarter?\nFrank Blake: So, Matt, first off, I\u2019ll ask Marvin to address some of the actions we\u2019ve taken in the store to better serve our pros. But I\u2019d just say, generally, it\u2019s tough for us to measure share period. It is really hard for us to measure share with the pro, because the pro shops ask so many different channels, there are so many different kinds of pros in our stores. So we really don't have a good read through into what -- to what extent do our pro numbers reflect some possible share gain versus the market. Since we started, for several years now we\u2019ve had a notional theory of what we see in the housing recovery and since we are seeing that play out with our pro numbers we are more incline to take that as more general market recovery. But we have done and thank you for noting me, we have done somethings that are very focused on this customer segment things or maybe Marvin you want to comment on some of those.\nMarvin Ellison: Sure. Matt, we really took advantage of the downturn. We had processes and our focus was really not that good to be quite candidate and so when the market was depressed we decided to invest in a couple of things. Number one, we had a very distinct focus on what we do in the store and what we do outside of the store. In the store was primarily for our smaller pros. Out of the store was for pros that typically would not venture into Home Depot because of the nature of their business. And in the store we focus on speed and convenience. We put in dedicated cashiers for the pros. We put in dedicated loading or we created pro power hours where we eliminated tasking and we want it service focus with specific times of the day and we really -- made a really consistent focus on speed. We leverage the mobile point of sale to help pros accelerate the transactions then we shift outside of the store. We put in a sales force design specifically to go to the pros, larger pros and to make sales calls talking about the features and benefits of working, and buying from the Home Depot. We work with Craig\u2019s team to improve the bid room process. It would take into past days to get a bid back. We turn it into minutes. We continue to listen to pros and just made the necessary changes and what we hope is that when the market started to improve that the investments in training and service that we put in place would benefit us. It\u2019s still very early. We still have a lot of work to do and to Frank point it\u2019s difficult to measure market share, but we have to believe that all of the dedicated focus over the last two years maybe giving us disproportionate benefit as the market improves.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer: Hi. Good morning.\nFrank Blake: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer: First question I just want to follow on Matt\u2019s question on the pro a bit, but you called out the strength you\u2019ve seen in the pro business. Clearly, as you said, it\u2019s been a big focus for Home Depot. But you connecting better with those customers now, you\u2019re following that a better? Is there, as you look at the buying patterns now, with all those going on the macro environment, it\u2019s not surprising pros taking up a bit? Are you seeing something new data to suggest, there is, we do have a sustainable trend here now for Home Depot in this pro business more than we\u2019ve seen in the past?\nFrank Blake: I would say, Brain, this is interestingly. This is the first quarter that the pro segment sales have outpaced our consumer segment sales. So we are, I think, appropriately cautious about drawing broader generalizations. As Carol said, we raised our guidance thinking through what\u2019s going to, what we think is going to playout in the second quarter and we are just I would say, it\u2019s a bit early from this quarter to say, boy, this is sustaining. We do like the trend over the last, I mean, definitely the trend has been a positive trend.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It might be helpful to share with you the top 10 pro classes to the question of what are they buying, it includes plywood, just dimensional lumber, pipe and fittings, flooring tiles, faucet moldings, interior paint, studs and lightbulbs, that\u2019s pretty core to the pro customer. \nMarvin Ellison: Brian, the only thing I will add is when you talk about the large pro which we define as over 10,000 annual spend, and the smaller pro is improving and that\u2019s a good sign as Frank noted earlier and what we are hearing from the pros is a very simple definition as to why. A lot of the smaller pros basically shut their businesses down and started to work for the larger pros. And so as the business and the market improves, there are more jobs available and a lot of smaller pros are venturing out again to open up their shops and they are back in business. But it\u2019s very early. But the trend is positive. We just hope that it sustains. \nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer: And then maybe just a shorter question on, a lot of us are focused on the seasonal sales because there has been a lot of shifts with the weather and such, but is there a way that you could look at your business and say, okay, despite all these weather shifts we\u2019ve had 2013 versus 2012, seasonal sales were actually better this year, or the same as last year, is there some way to look at like that?\nCraig Menear: Weather adjusted seasonal sales metric, we really don\u2019t have that. That would be a difficult one to come up with.\nFrank Blake: I think what we do, do is we look at this really on a half basis. And we try to take into account both quarters combined to eliminate the shifting noise if you will from year to year and we look at multi-year penetrations by category by week. And this is why as Carol said, we feel like we\u2019ve got an opportunity to gain most of those sales in Q2. You may have some categories like pre-emergent that we may not get it all back. But we feel pretty confident that we will get the majority of it.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.\nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: What do you guys make of the recent decline in lumber prices, anything that\u2019s driving that and just getting to your outlook for inflation over the balance of the year, what are you guys thinking on that front?\nFrank Blake: The lumber price has been interesting for the year. I think output in Q1 from the industry was up double-digit US, as well as high single digit from Canada. So I am sure that has a factor on driving the overall pricing in the market. It\u2019s still up significantly year-over-year and I think that\u2019s probably a factor to the recent declines.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And we plan on a commodity neutral basis. So as you know we haven\u2019t listed the back half of the year for anything that might happen with prices up or down.\nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: And then diving a little bit more into that pro -- some of the pro questions here. Any indication in some of the categories, things like job site tools, windows, things like that, are they starting to show any kind of an uptick or is that still on the comp?\nFrank Blake: I mean we look at pro categories, Carol called it top 10, we are seeing growth in those businesses and we saw growth in the first quarter obviously versus the fourth quarter which we would expect to see some based on just seasonal. So we are encouraged by the growth across these categories. \nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: One last one, when spring arrives this year, I mean when does it typically peak? I mean we have seen the peak now, does the peak occur kind of as you get into June, just trying to understand how long the spring season goes, when it arrives, when it -- at a similar time it did this year?\nFrank Blake: That really varies by area of the country. And as you can imagine the south peaks several weeks in advance of the north but even in that the peak in any given area can shift up to roughly two weeks give or take. So it really does vary by the area of the country. In some areas it can be as early as week 10 and other areas, it can be as late as 17 or 18. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yeah, based on our month to date sales I would say have a peak. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Greg Melich with ISI Group.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Carol, I have one follow-up question from before and a longer-term one. Carol, you mentioned that May is running great. Would you describe April as great as well?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, April was outstanding month. But I also want to bring your attention to the timing of Easter because of where Easter fell this year versus last year. March was the negative comp was overstated by about 230 basis points which means a positive comp in April was overstated by about 230 basis points.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Got it. So April was great, not outstanding if you adjust for Easter. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Okay.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: I\u2019ve got some more serious questions. Your free cash flow guidance you didn\u2019t update as part of the change in your EPS guidance. I think it was around $7 billion. Is that change particularly given that it seemed that inventory was only up 2% to get the sort of top line growth. Should we expect more free cash flow leverage or is it still the same number there?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: No. We\u2019ve updated our forecast. We didn\u2019t call it because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really material in a $7 billion number, but it\u2019s up maybe $200 million or $300 million.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: That\u2019s great. Thanks.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yeah.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: Hi. Thanks. So one short-term, one longer term question. Shorter term, this quarter can you tell the EPS impact of that calendar shift of the 540 odd million dollars?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure. The EPS impact was $0.03.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you. And then the longer-term, so it was on my model, last time you add an equivalent sales per foot number, your operating margins were 250 points lower than they are now. So I sort of start to think of longer term and if you can get back to where sales per foot were pre-recession, is there any reason to believe that your operating margin should be that much higher, 200 to 400 basis points higher than they were last time they peaked?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, as you point out, we have a ton of operating leverage in our business and the great work of the team in terms of cost out and just driving productivity, it\u2019s more productive than it\u2019s ever been. We\u2019ve guided to 12% operating margin by 2015. Let us get there and then we'll talk about how much or opportunities \u2026.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: You are going to get pretty close by the end of this year, may be within 50 basis points. We\u2019ll wait for that update?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Very good. Thank you.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank: Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.\nAlan Rifkin - Barclays Capital: Thank you very much. With respect to the average ticket 900 plus. Is the composition between large Pro, small Pro and the DIY similar within that category as rest of -- as the corporate average?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, when you look at that average ticket performance, some of the top drivers of year-over-year growth were in the appliance category. And that\u2019s mostly consumer.\nAlan Rifkin - Barclays Capital: That is mostly consumer. Okay. So collectively, I mean, compared to three and six months ago, what is your take on the proclivity for both the Pro customer large and small as well as the DIY customer to take on some of these larger projects. Are you seeing clear evidence of that?\nFrank Blake: I mean, I think we\u2019ve seen expansion of the project businesses I call out. We have seen nice growth in the simple core, so whether that\u2019s customer taking on a flooring projects or now taking on storage projects, where in the past, they might have differed that. We\u2019ve begun to see those categories have nice growth in the business. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. Other drivers to kind of expansion in ticket is also of innovation. So things like LED, which drives ticket expansion inside of a category, things like lithium technology which drive expansion in tools now across almost five departments in the store, all of those have positive influences on the growth of average ticket as well.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And just one thing, we are looking at very carefully and this data comes from CoreLogic and that is where home owners are on a loan-to-value basis. Because once home owners believe their home is more of an investment than an extent, we believe the nature of their spending will change. And so this data came out in fourth quarter, it just shows that it would have negative equity spend may be $10,000 a year but those that have 100% positive equity or maybe loan-to-value as much as 49%, those been close to $3000 a year. We\u2019re watching with home price appreciation, how powerful we move into different spending buckets and then trying to determine what the impact on our business will be. It\u2019s still little early, Alan, obviously because its data is just coming out. But we\u2019re really trying to understand, what it could mean for our and the project nature of our business going forward.\nAlan Rifkin - Barclays Capital: Okay. Thank you, Carol. One follow-up, if I may for you. Obviously, California, Florida, Nevada, Arizona outside these gains, where are we today in absolute terms with where stores in those markets are relative to where we were six years ago when the crisis really began. Are we above those levels in absolute terms at the store level?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Not yet. No.\nAlan Rifkin - Barclays Capital: Any quantification of still how far below you are on an average store revenue basis on those markets?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Just think about it as of the end of 2012, we still had close to $3 billion of sales to recover from what we lost during the recession.\nAlan Rifkin - Barclays Capital: Very interesting. Thank you. Good luck.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff: And now, we have time for one more questions.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets: Good morning guys.\nFrank Blake: Good morning.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Good morning\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets: Obviously, there were some weather challenges that you guys kind of called out already. But in generally, I think what we have continued to see over the last several quarters is relatively modest improvements in the smaller ticket sales but pretty big improvements in bigger ticket sales. I guess, my question is how much of that is due to change in mix on the assortment side. And if this trend continues, is that something you continue to adjust in terms of the mix and assortment of the stores in addition to the labor enhancement, Marvin's already called out?\nFrank Blake: I mean, it is certainly a portion of this is driven by the growth in categories like appliances which carry a big ticket. But certainly in the first quarter, the smaller ticket was clearly negatively impacted by the lack of garden sales which is a massive driver to transaction on smaller ticket. As you can imagine, lots of customers coming in, buying some bags of dirt, buying live goods, and so on, which carry a much smaller ticket. But as we as we look at the larger ticket, improvement in penetration in lumber with our Pro customer\u2019s, one of the top classes, plywood, dimensional, lumber fall into that, gypsum those are businesses where customers on the Pro side are buying multiples helping to drive the larger ticket as well as you say the appliance business. We\u2019ve seen over multiple quarters, the hard work that we\u2019ve put into things like our kitchen business overall and as well as the improvement of our services businesses, which drives ticket, pay off and help drive the growth in the larger ticker over the past several quarters. We still feel that it\u2019s balanced, that will be driving both -- on an annualized basis both transaction as well as ticket in our business.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets: Well, is there anything that you\u2019ve seen in the business to make you think that the trends that we\u2019ve seen recently won\u2019t continue. I mean, it seems like you\u2019ve been calling our appliances for a while. Lumber has obviously been gaining steam for the last couple of quarters. These tend to become a long cycle trend, don\u2019t\u2019 they?\nFrank Blake: Yeah. I think they will continue to help us grow the larger ticket categories for sure.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot guys.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you very much for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: And that concludes today\u2019s conference.

Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Diane, and good morning everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $19.2 billion, up 8.3% from last year. Comp sales were positive 7.9% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.05. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 8.9%.  We finished the year strong with our largest quarterly sales growth for the year in the fourth quarter. We continue to see broad based growth across the store and our geographies. Our three U.S. divisions each exceeded their sales plan and all 19 U.S. regions saw mid-single digit comp growth or better in the fourth quarter. As Ted will detail, all departments had positive comps and we had strong growth in ticket and transactions in the quarter. Strength in our pro driven businesses as well as double digit sales growth in our service business also aided ticket in the quarter. As a result, both average ticket and transaction counts reached new fourth quarter record highs. Our sales were aided by a strong response to our holiday d\u00e9cor, gift center, as well as our Black Friday events during the quarter. Our online channel also had a strong performance over the Cyber week period with record traffic and orders, while at the same time our online customer service scores improved. For the year, our online business grew over $1 billion, a growth rate of over 36%. Almost 40% of our online orders were picked up in the store, a testament to the interconnectedness customers desire for our business.  Marc Powers and the store operation team, along with our IT team, completed the roll-out of our second generation First Phones in the fourth quarter. This latest customer service tool provides a more intuitive smartphone interface, internet access to convert online sales in the aisle, integrated mobile checkout for line busting, and greatly improved overall processing speed. On the supply chain front, Mark Holifield and the supply chain team worked tirelessly to manage through a difficult environment and even drove productivity through our network. As we go forward, there is a tentative labor agreement at the west coast ports. It will take a while to get our freight moving more efficiently there, and we have a challenging transportation environment that continues. We\u2019ll continue to leverage our distribution network to minimize any impacts to in-stock rates. Internationally, both our Mexican and Canadian businesses posted positive comps in local currency for the quarter, making it 45 and 13 quarters in a row of positive comps respectively. We also completed the acquisition of HD Supply Hardware Solutions, formerly known as Crown Bolt, in the fourth quarter. Through bringing the business back into the Home Depot family, we expect to further enhance our supply chain capabilities and product offerings in hardware. Looking at the full year of 2014, we achieved our highest retail sales in company history, and through driving productivity and expense control we also reached the highest net earnings in company history. Adding over $4 billion in sales and almost $1 billion in net earnings requires flexibility and coordination on multiple fronts, and our associates and suppliers were able to respond effectively. For 2015, we believe overall GDP growth and continued tailwind from housing recovery will be the principle drivers of growth for our business. Consensus 2015 GDP growth forecast calls for moderate growth, and most housing data points towards a continued moderate recovery in the U.S. housing market.  Based on this outlook, we expect comp growth in the U.S. of approximately 4.5%. As Carol will detail, we expect similar growth in our international businesses but currency headwinds could result in lower total company growth; therefore, we expect total company comp growth of approximately 3.3 to 4.5% and corresponded diluted earnings per share of $5.11 to $5.17.  In 2013, we set out long-term financial targets to achieve a 13% operating margin and a 27% return on invested capital by the end of fiscal 2015. Our guidance implies that we will accomplish these goals and will continue to drive growth and productivity in the business in 2015 and beyond.  Finally, today our board announced a 26% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.59 per share. The board also authorized a new share repurchase program of $18 billion. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create value for our shareholders. We will invest to sustain and grow our business and return excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  I want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. For the second half of the year, 100% of our stores qualify for success sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. This is our largest second half payout to date. We look forward to continuing this momentum in 2015. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig, and good morning everyone. We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and saw broad strength across all geographies and across the entire store. Nine departments had comps above the company average for the fourth quarter. They were: tools, lumber, millwork, lighting, d\u00e9cor, building materials, kitchen, bath, and hardware. All the rest of our departments had positive comps in the mid-single digits. Pro categories had tremendous growth during the quarter and we saw double digit comps in compressors, siding, roofing, ladders, concrete, fasteners, and several lumber categories. Our millwork categories also had another quarter of great performance led by double digit comps in patio doors, windows, interior doors and exterior doors. Maintenance and repair categories continued to perform well and we saw comps above the company average in products like water heaters, wiring devices, cleaning, conduit and caulks. D\u00e9cor products were also strong with comps above the company average in vanities, bathroom fixtures, decorative holiday, interior lighting, and hard surface flooring. Several events had record performance during the quarter. Black Friday was our biggest sales in history, helping drive double digit comps in categories like appliances and grills for the quarter. Our gift centers performed extremely well and we saw double digit comps in tool storage, portable power, power tool accessories, and hand tools. Finally, our storage event was well received with double digit comps.  In 2014, we reviewed 154 product categories or roughly a third of the store using our merchandising planning tools. Results to date have been promising. For example, in vanities we created store clusters based on certain SKU attributes like vanity size and finish. This allows us to better match our assortments to customer preferences in those clusters. Additionally, we leveraged data from our online channel to bring a new assortment of products to the stores which allows customers to choose from different vanity tops and storage cabinet combinations. This assortment is currently in about 100 U.S. stores and we plan on setting several hundred additional stores throughout 2015. In the fourth quarter, total comp transactions grew by 4.9% and for the year we set a new transaction record with over 1.4 billion total transactions. In the quarter, comp ticket increased 2.9%. Our average ticket increase reflects about 16 basis points of growth due to commodity price inflation in products such as lumber. Transactions per ticket under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.1% for the fourth quarter. Transactions per ticket over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 10.3% in the fourth quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were appliances, water heaters, and several installation service categories such as windows, roofing, and sheds. For the year, our average ticket grew by 1.9%. Now let me turn our attention to the first quarter. We\u2019re excited about the launch of our new color solution center, featuring Behr, Glidden, and our Home Decorators Collection pain brands. We worked closely with our supplier partners and leveraged consumer insights data to create a better shopping experience for our customers. The new center clearly outlines our paint assortment, expands our color offering, and simplifies the selection process. We plan to roll it to all U.S. stores by the end of the second quarter. For our pro customers, we are introducing new and exclusive products in Milwaukee, Makita and DeWalt, all leaders in professional tools. New products within the Milwaukee FUEL line-up, like the circular saw and Whole Hog heavy duty drill, have increased battery life, power and durability, saving our pros time and money on the job site.  We\u2019re looking forward to spring and are excited about several new product categories in grills and patio. In grills, we have a new and exclusive brand launch with Nexgrill and are introducing several exclusive models from Weber and Kitchenaid. Our expanded assortment online offers numerous options from premium grills to pizza ovens. Our patio assortment continues to grow, including a new collection from Brown Jordan, new fabric and color options in our Create Your Own collection, and expanded accessory offerings. For the gardener, Vigoro\u2019s new colored mulch in red, black and brown offers a 12-month color guarantee at a great value.  Our spring Black Friday event will once again offer amazing values for our customers. The stores will be loaded with exciting products and exclusives on items like live goods, grills, and outdoor power equipment. We\u2019re looking forward to a great spring season. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Ted, and good morning. In the fourth quarter, sales were $19.2 billion. Comp sales were positive 7.9% for the quarter with comps of 7.8% in November, 7.9% in December, and 8% in January. The continuing strength in the U.S. dollar negatively impacted total company comps by approximately $149 million. Comp sales for U.S. stores were positive 8.9% for the quarter with comps of 8.8% in November, 8.6% in December, and 9.3% in January. For the year, our sales increased 5.5% to $83.2 billion, and total company comp sales were positive 5.3%. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 6.1%.  Our total company gross margin was 35.1% for the fourth quarter, 10 basis points higher than last year driven by gross margin expansion in our U.S. business. The year-over-year margin expansion in our U.S. business is explained by the following. First, we experienced 18 basis points of gross margin expansion due to productivity within our supply chain and lower fuel costs. Second, we are starting to see a turnaround in our shrink performance and lower shrink contributed 7 basis points of gross margin expansion. Finally, we experienced 15 basis points of gross margin contraction due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold, namely a higher penetration of lower margin product categories like appliances and lumber. For the year, we experienced 6 basis points of gross margin expansion. Operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 139 basis points to 23.7% in the fourth quarter. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth and continued focus on expense control. Fiscal 2014 operating expense as a percent of sales was 22.2%, a decrease of 90 basis points from what we reported last year. For the year, our expenses grew at 25% of our sales growth rate, in line with our most recent guidance. Just a comment on data breach-related expenses. In the fourth quarter, our gross data breach expenses were approximately $20 million. After estimating our insurance recovery, we recorded approximately $5 million of net data breach related expenses in the quarter. For the year, our gross data breach expenses were approximately $63 million, and after expected insurance recovery our net data breach expenses were approximately $33 million. Our operating margin for the quarter was 11.4% and for the year reached 12.6%. Interest and investing income increased by $111 million in the quarter, reflecting a gain on sale of 4.1 million shares of HD Supply common stock. Since the beginning of the year and including the fourth quarter transaction, we have sold 12.2 million shares of HD Supply common stock for $323 million or $0.15 of earnings per diluted share, of which $0.05 was recognized in the fourth quarter. We now own approximately 4.1 million shares or 2% of HD Supply outstanding shares.  In the quarter, interest expense increased by $31 million from last year due primarily to interest associated with higher long-term debt levels than one year ago. Our income tax provision rate was 34.1% in the fourth quarter and 36.4% for the year. The tax rate for the quarter and the year reflected the benefit from favorable tax settlements and the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, which provided a one-year extension of certain expiring tax credits. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.05, an increase of 43.8% from last year, and for the year diluted earnings per share were $4.71, an increase of 25.3% compared to the prior year. Moving to some additional highlights, during the fourth quarter we opened three new stores, two in Mexico and one in Canada. We ended the year with 2,269 stores. At the end of the year, selling square footage was 236 million, flat to last year, and sales per square foot increased 5.3% to $352. At the end of the year, inventory was $11.1 billion, flat to last year, but that\u2019s a bit distorted due to a stronger U.S. dollar. On a currency neutral basis, inventory dollars were up approximately $193 million from last year. Inventory turns were 4.7 times, up from 4.6 times last year. Payables were also flat to last year, again distorted by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. On a currency neutral basis, payables were up $98 million from the prior year. We generated strong cash in the year and used that cash, as well as proceeds from an incremental debt offering, to invest in our business, repurchase our shares, and pay a healthy dividend to our shareholders. For the year, we spent roughly $1.6 billion in capital, including the recent acquisition of HD Supply Hardware Solutions. We repurchased $7 billion or 80 million of our outstanding shares, including $1.26 billion or 12.4 million shares in the fourth quarter, and we paid $2.5 billion in dividends.  Our capital allocation philosophy supports our commitment to deliver high returns on invested capital. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 24.9%, 400 basis points higher than at the end of fiscal 2013.  We detailed our 2015 guidance in our press release, but I want to take a few moments to comment on a highlight. Remember that we guide off of GAAP, so fiscal 2015 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2014. Further, our earnings per share guidance does not take into account any expenses that we may incur in the future for data breach-related claims. While these expenses are reasonably possible, they are not at this time estimable. When we are able to estimate these expenses, we will provide an update to our guidance. As we look to 2015, we expect U.S. comps to grow at GDP plus approximately 150 basis points coming from the recovery in the housing market. We project similar growth rates in Canada and Mexico, yielding total company comp sales of 4.5%. With the benefit of new stores, we project total sales growth of approximately 4.7%. The recent significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar, however, suggests that total company sales growth could be lower. As a result, we are providing a range of sales, comp sales, and diluted earnings per share growth to reflect the difference between 2014 average exchange rates and current exchange rates.  If foreign currency exchange rates remain where they are today, this would cause a negative impact to fiscal 2015 net sales growth of approximately $1 billion, dropping our projected total sales growth rate from 4.7% to 3.5%, and our projected comp sales growth from 4.5% to 3.3%. For 2015, we are projecting our gross margin rate to remain flat to what we reported in fiscal 2014. This projection is based on our belief that we will experience growth rates higher than the company average in lower margin categories like building materials offsetting projected gross margin expansion coming from continued productivity. We don\u2019t expect our gross margin to be materially impacted by exchange rates. On a currency neutral basis, we are forecasting our expenses to grow at approximately 40% of the rate of our sales growth. This is higher than the expense growth factor we reported in fiscal 2014 for a couple of reasons. First, we had some expense benefit throughout the year in our casualty reserves and other items that we do not believe will repeat. Second, as we continue to harden our IT security, we will be investing in higher level of IT resources to achieve our goal. For the year, we project that our operating margin will grow by approximately 60 basis points. We don\u2019t expect our operating margin to be materially impacted by exchange rates. We expect our diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 10% to $5.17, but if exchange rates remain where they are today, our projected diluted earnings per share would be approximately $5.11.  As Craig mentioned, in support of our commitment to share repurchase, our board just announced a new share repurchase authorization of $18 billion, replacing our remaining authorization of $1.5 billion. Our 2015 diluted earnings per share guidance includes our plan to repurchase approximately $4.5 billion of outstanding shares during the year using excess cash.  For the year, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $9 billion. We will use our cash to invest back into the business. Our 2015 capital spending plan is approximately $1.6 billion, and 11% increase from what we spent in fiscal 2014 in support of interconnected retail and to continue to harden our IT security. We will also use our cash to pay our dividend, and as Craig mentioned, we just announced a 26% increase in our quarterly dividend which equates to an annual dividend of $2.36, in line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50%. Our commitment to shareholder returns continues to be a hallmark of the Home Depot.  So we thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call, and Kayla, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take our first from Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDan Binder: Hi, good morning. Carol, you made some good progress on expense growth last year, in particular the first half of the year. I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about how you view that 40% expense growth rate as a percent of sales front half versus back half.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure. So let me take you back to the guidance that we provided one year ago where we said that we thought our expenses for 2014 would grow at 33% of our sales growth. Fast forward to the end of this year, we did better than that. Our expenses grew at 25% of our sales growth, and there were a couple of reasons for that. We had good guidance throughout the year. We talked to you about some of those principally in our casualty area, this being workers\u2019 compensation and general liability, and some other good guys that we don\u2019t think will repeat next year. Further, we had $33 million of data breach-related expenses. Now, we aren\u2019t projecting for next year, but we are projecting higher investments in our IT infrastructure, including people. So if you look at the good guys that we had, including the data breach-related expenses, it nets out to $70 million. If you added the $70 million to the expenses that we reported for 2014, you would have seen that our expense growth factor for the year was more like 33%, and then if you run off of that adjusted base for 2015, the adjusted expense growth factor is about 33%. So hopefully that gives you some color as to what we\u2019re thinking about in expenses.\nDan Binder: And does it look a little bit lopsided front half versus back half?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, as you know, we run our business obviously by quarters, but it\u2019s almost easier to run it of halves because weather plays such havoc with our sales. If you look at the spread of the year by half, I will tell you the top line is pretty tight and the expense growth factor is actually higher in the first half of the year than it is in the second half of the year. Then, if you break it down by quarters - and again, the quarters can be all over the place, as we know, because of weather - but it would suggest that the expense growth factor would be higher in Q1 and Q2 than it would be in Q3 and Q4. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful.\nDan Binder: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Horvers with JP Morgan.\nChris Horvers: Thanks and good morning. Just a follow-up on that. Wal-Mart has raised a lot of questions about wage pressures in the United States, and a lot of investors are curious how that might impact other big retailers out there. So do you have any comment on your exposure to minimum wage and how the Wal-Mart announcement could affect the competitive environment?\nCraig Menear: Chris, we have prided ourselves on paying above the market as a company for a number of years. That\u2019s our intent going forward. We continually look at the market on a market-by-market basis and make adjustments where it\u2019s appropriate.\nChris Horvers: Okay, so it doesn\u2019t sound like--it sounds like you\u2019re already above and it doesn\u2019t seem to be any issue for you this year.\nCraig Menear: Yes, again - with the guidance we\u2019ve given, we\u2019ve taken into account what we continually do, and that\u2019s adjusted according to each given market as it\u2019s needed.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And you may have seen our announcement to hire 80,000 seasonal workers, and Marc Powers was sharing with us this morning that we\u2019re having great applications.\nMarc Powers : Right, from across the country. We have strength out in the west already with our spring sales, and we are able to keep up with our customer demand and deliver on a great customer experience by keeping up with the hiring from our hiring pools. As we look across the country, we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have any issues whatsoever supporting the demand that we\u2019ll have this spring across the country as well.\nChris Horvers: Understood. Then Carol, it seems like your guidance doesn\u2019t--your share repurchase guidance doesn\u2019t embed any incremental leverage. You ended the year about 1.8 times, so can you talk about has the philosophy changed in terms of the leverage level that you will target, and sort of what the rationale is behind that?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure, Chris. I\u2019ll take you back to a year ago where we guided share repurchases of $5 billion, but we ended up doing $7 billion. This year we\u2019re guiding $4.5 billion. We tend not to guide debt finance share repurchases, but our philosophy regarding leverage has not changed. Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio, as you point out, stands at 1.8 times. That gives us $2 billion of borrowing capacity, so as we have shown in the past two years, we\u2019ve guided and then we\u2019ve done more. It\u2019s not our intent to let the adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio drop.\nChris Horvers: Perfect. Have a great spring, guys. Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.\nSeth Sigman: Great, thanks and good morning. Just a question on gross margin, and it may be for you, Carol. You guys have done a great job managing it. The guidance for flat seems pretty consistent. I\u2019m just wondering on the mix if that should be a bigger impact in 2015 than in \u201914, and just generally, are there maybe some offsets there on the positive side like we saw in Q4? I guess there\u2019s also an expectation for some deflation across the various input costs, so how do you think about that?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, we think about it very carefully. We start with our approach on where the business is going, and we believe that we will have outpaced growth in lower margin categories just because we haven\u2019t fully recovered some of those lower margin categories. If you look at peak to trough sales, we have categories that have not fully recovered to the tune of $4 billion of sales. I\u2019ll call out one of those - that would be millwork. Peak to trough is still a billion dollar opportunity for us. As Ted called out, we had great growth in millwork in the fourth quarter. We want those sales to come. We want to recover those sales, and so we want to provide plenty of room within our margin guidance to allow for that to happen. It doesn\u2019t mean, however, that we\u2019re not focused on productivity. We are focused on productivity. We will drive productivity, but we want to make sure that we leave plenty of room for growth in the categories. Further growth will naturally happen; and maybe, Ted, you want to give some more color to that?\nTed Decker: That\u2019s right. We track our 40 largest classes, and 16 of those have not recovered from peak. Predominant categories there are in lumber and building materials, so we saw great results in those categories in Q4 and expect that going into 2015, so that will be some margin pressure, and holding flat is because we exceed productivity in other parts of the business.\nCraig Menear: Seth, I think if you look back at the guidance we\u2019ve given over the past several years in terms of how we would actually deliver, it\u2019s been a combination of expense control and increasing our op margin. That has always played out just a little bit differently than the way we\u2019d planned it, based on what happens in the marketplace. So we\u2019ll remain focused on productivity, and the pressures in the market and how we want to apply our pressure in the market will ultimately determine where those two lines fall.\nSeth Sigman: Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Then maybe just one follow-up. As you look on trends on the ticket side, big tickets, nice to see the improvement there. Maybe more from a merchandising perspective, are there still areas where you can push up pricing, whether it\u2019s adding more technology or adding different brands to the mix?\nTed Decker: Well, I wouldn\u2019t say we specifically look at pushing up pricing, but certainly as we\u2019ve talked to running the business as a portfolio and applying our merchandising and planning tools on assortments, we\u2019ve seen that when we offer innovation and a better assortment, the customer has followed those price points. But again, we\u2019re letting the customer take us there, just showing great assortments and innovative product, and the customer is responding. \nCraig Menear: I think two great examples of that are what\u2019s happened over the years in lithium technology and LED. Clearly the customer is willing to spend a higher ticket for those products because of the benefit they get from them.\nSeth Sigman: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.\nAram Rubinson: Hi, thanks. It\u2019s Wolfe Research, how are you?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Hey Aram, how are you?\nAram Rubinson: All right. A couple things. Can you talk about the inventory a little bit? Carol, I know you mentioned that there was some FX element, but it still would have only risen 2% on kind of an adjusted basis, so I\u2019m curious whether or not you had shortages getting inventory in, or whether you\u2019re just getting more efficient on that line because the turns would have improved pretty significantly, with or without that adjustment.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, I think our supply chain has done a masterful job of managing a very difficult situation. For sure we\u2019ve had some challenges on the west coast, but if you recall last year, we had challenges domestically because of Snowmageddon, so when you net it all out, our inventory was in pretty good shape.  We are on a march to get to a five times turn. On the guidance that we gave you this morning, we\u2019re not going to get there in 2015. We\u2019re very careful here - we don\u2019t want to go out of stock. [Indiscernible] productivity and inventory, it will go up another tenth or so in 2015, but we don\u2019t want to do this in a way that would put harm in our business, and our [indiscernible] rates are really pretty good.\nCraig Menear: We\u2019ve shared with you in the past that our number one priority is in stock. Clearly we will focus on inventory productivity, but that can\u2019t come at the expense of in stock. Mark, I don\u2019t know if you want to--Mark Holifield is here. I don\u2019t know if you want to comment a little bit on the question around the port.\nMark Holifield: Yes, good morning. Transportation has been a challenge. Clearly the west coast port situation has been tough with 12 to 16-day delays there generally in getting our import product in, but we\u2019ve been able to get that product through. There is a fair amount of uncertainty what the new normal will be once the ports get back to normal, but we\u2019ll continue to leverage our supply chain to drive inventory turns and, most importantly, in stock.\nAram Rubinson: Well, good job driving a comp like that without a great logistics backdrop. The follow-up, if I can, is just in terms of categories. You gave us some characterization of the growth in certain categories. Can you tell us where maybe you\u2019re seeing kind of either outsized market share gains or maybe even some market share losses, and maybe kind of where in \u201915 you\u2019re putting your big foot forward?\nTed Decker: Well, I\u2019d say that we saw market share gains across [indiscernible] categories we track with public information, we\u2019ve gained share in 11 of those categories, so it was pretty broad-based. I think those same categories are likely to continue into 2015. We\u2019re very excited about new paint color solutions center. We\u2019re going to invest in another 170 stores expanding appliances. You\u2019ve heard us talk about our hard set flooring. We\u2019re also going to reset the inbay hard set flooring this year, which is great new tile product, a lot of wood-look tile that are getting up to two and three feet in length, so all that new exciting product is going to be coming into the store. We continued to invest in our tool centers, so you saw the double digit comps really across the board in our power tool categories. That\u2019s great innovative product, but we\u2019ve also been going back every year, doing a couple hundred stores and refreshing our tool crib. So we\u2019ll continue with all of those initiatives and look to take more share.\nAram Rubinson: Okay, best of luck, guys. Thanks for the call.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks, good morning, and very nice results. A question on sales - it was a nice acceleration this quarter. Can you attribute it to either the underlying home improvement market getting stronger? I don\u2019t know if there was any recovery you could detect post-breach. I\u2019m not sure the segment is very gasoline price-sensitive, but to any extent, do you think that could have played a role?\nCraig Menear: A couple of comments, and I\u2019ll ask Carol to comment as well. So as it relates to the gasoline, we\u2019ve looked hard over the years to try to look at the correlation gas prices to sales, and we have not been able to draw that correlation. Clearly it is a positive thing when a customer has more disposable income in their pocket, so even though we can\u2019t draw that correlation, that is a good news thing for us. I\u2019d also say that we were very pleased with the level of transaction growth that we had in the quarter. Matter of fact, it was above what we had anticipated. I think in large part that\u2019s a strong response to the great programs that Ted called out in terms of the events that we put together and just awesome execution by our store associates as well. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Maybe a few other data points we\u2019d throw out. On our pro customer for known data sets, and this would be looking at private label credit card sales for our pros as well as pros who are managed accounts, so our growth in those pros, that was above the company average, and that then is supported by the merchandise strength that Ted called out in his comments.  On the housing front, the data is really pretty interesting. Relative to what we thought would happen, home prices came in the year, I think around 4%. We thought they\u2019d be in the 5 or 6% area, so they were up, not as much as we thought, but pretty much in line with what we thought. Turnover actually was down slightly, which was really interesting. We thought we\u2019d get a boost from turnover in 2014, and actually it was down slightly. [Indiscernible], the forecast is it will be up in 2015, which gives us a lot of confidence for the guidance that we just gave for the full year. The other thing I\u2019ll throw out there, we\u2019re spending some time researching. We don\u2019t have a good point of view, and maybe you want to do some of this as you do your research. There is this research that was done 10 years ago about a wealth effect on home price appreciation and how it might be a six to nine to 12-month lag. If that were to be true, then you could attribute some of the benefit in the fourth quarter to the home price appreciation that occurred in 2013. We haven\u2019t formally formulated our thoughts there. We\u2019re studying this - this is research that, again, is 10 years old, but we\u2019re looking into that because we find it to be very intriguing research.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you. My follow up is regarding sales and leverage. Carol, you mentioned expense dollars grow at 40%, and you said some of it is a little bit more spending. If sales growth ends up being better than your guidance, and you mentioned some of the higher ticket categories, I guess some of the building material areas getting better, and so maybe there is reason that you see a better top line next year. Does that mean you\u2019ll still spend at that rate to get 40%--I mean, 40% growth, or will you allow that to flow through to the bottom line?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It really depends on how the sales growth comes. As you know, we have an activity-based staffing model inside of our stores, and payroll is our largest expense. If the outperformance was solely in the form of transactions, the expense growth actually would be more along the lines of 40%. If it, however, came through ticket, it would all fall through the bottom line, so it really depends on how the sales come.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay, thanks. Good luck.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Good morning, nice quarter. A couple questions. First off, with respect to the capital allocation and the buyback, and looking at the numbers you laid out today with the new $18 billion buyback [indiscernible], should we expect some type of, maybe I would say philosophical change between how you allocate capital between buybacks and dividends going forward, or will the split largely remain the same?\nCraig Menear: Yes, I would say we\u2019re not looking for any major change as you go forward. We review our capital allocation approach with our board on a quarterly basis, and so if you look at what the board just authorized in terms of share repurchase, we\u2019ve spelled out what we put into the plan based on excess cash, but clearly it implies that we\u2019ll do more than that, given what the authorization was just put forth with. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: I would say, Brian, that our commitment to the dividend is solid. Could it be higher? That\u2019s subject to the board\u2019s decision. Would it be lower? No. So that gives you an idea of what might happen over time in terms of changing shifts between the percentage of dollars that go to dividends and share repurchase.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. As far as my follow-up, you talked a lot about currency and the translation impact, I guess the negative translation, expected negative translation impact in 2015. As we think about the gross margin and your guidance for potentially a flat gross margin in \u201915, is there some type of benefit you\u2019ll get from the sourcing side with the stronger U.S. dollar that maybe could impact [indiscernible] gross margin guidance or could potentially represent some upside?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, so for the products that we source outside the United States from the United States, most of that is denominated in dollars because the currency footprint of our suppliers, even though they may be physically located outside the United States, the currency footprint is dollar denominated. So we don\u2019t see a lot of purchasing power benefits in that regard. I will say that actually there\u2019s a slight amount of risk in Canada because Canada buys in U.S. dollars, a small portion. Now, we\u2019ve hedged away--and that\u2019s a transaction exposure. We\u2019ve hedged most of that away, so I\u2019m not worried about it - that\u2019s why we\u2019ve guided flat for the year. I just wanted to share that with you.\nBrian Nagel: Congrats again. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Carol, I was hoping you could dig a little deeper into some of the comments that you just made about home prices and perhaps that being a driver of the strong performance over the last several quarters. Is that your hypothesis that the reason why the business performed so much better than what would be suggested by a straight GDP model and by the fact that housing didn\u2019t live up to what you had expected it to be in 2014, the business performed very well due in part to a delayed response to home prices, or is there some other factor like a catch-up in spending as a result of pent-up demand?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well see, this is the question, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019re trying to get behind it, because if you looked just at our model, we way outperformed what the model would have projected. Now, Ted shared with you the market share gains we enjoyed, so we know that was a driver of it, but I think there\u2019s something else going on. Is it delay factor? We don\u2019t know. We\u2019re studying this research. It\u2019s 10 years old, but we\u2019re studying it. Could it be this?  There have been 3.6 million single family homes added to the rental stock between 2006 and 2013. That 3.6 million homes, they are under-maintained. As those homes are moving out of rental into home ownership, they badly need remodels, and in fact the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies said that 2014 was the first year since 2005 where remodel dollars are up. So could it be some of that? I think the answer is yes. Michael, we\u2019re doing a lot of work in this regard, and as we formulate our thoughts here, we will certainly come back and share them with you.\nMichael Lasser: Could it also be that maybe not only has the way that consumers looked at home improvement spending evolved, but also the way that consumers have looked at the Home Depot store has evolved, given that you\u2019ve extended the penetration of fixed categories like appliances and consumables like cleaning supplies. Do you think that\u2019s a part of it as well, and I guess the question is how sustainable is it? Have you seen any slowdown in February as a result?\nCraig Menear: Michael, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we have and continue to evolve the offering in the store. There is no doubt about that. Ted called out some of the investments we\u2019ve made, whether that\u2019d be in appliances, whether it\u2019d be in flooring. As you pointed out, the expansion in categories like cleaning, which is a great repeat business for us, it\u2019s a consumable. I think it also goes to the hard work and effort that our store operations and all of our store associates have done over the past couple years to restore the service in our stores, so I think we have a better experience for our stores. And Michael, we can\u2019t forget the growth of the interconnected opportunity that we have, and we\u2019re seeing the customer engage with the Home Depot across multiple channels. Almost 40% of all of our transactions on HomeDepot.com actually finish in one of our orange box stores, so there\u2019s a lot of change that\u2019s happening in the retail environment right now, and we feel good about the offerings that we\u2019re putting out to our customers and driving value, as well as the opportunity going forward to continue to do that.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Earlier in the call in response to a question, I said that the first quarter is planned to be our highest comping quarter. Looking at our results February to date, we are on our plan.\nMichael Lasser: Awesome. Thank you so much, and good luck with spring.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler: Thanks a lot. Good morning. I have a couple sales questions, and the first relates to online. If you could just help us out with the math of the contribution of the online business to comps, and then also qualitatively give us a sense if you\u2019ve been able to measure what proportion, if any, of the online business that you\u2019re doing is incremental to Home Depot from a customer perspective.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: The answer to your first question is dot-com contributed 100 basis points to our comp in Q4, 110 basis points for the year. In terms of incrementality--\nCraig Menear: Largely, we\u2019re seeing growth in category both in-store as well as online. We have seen a few categories during 2014, like patio, make a harder shift to the online space in large part because of the digital capabilities allows us to do things like select your own cushions, which would be extremely difficult to execute in store.\nMatthew Fassler: Got it. My second question, your comps in the big ticket category or for big ticket transactions have continued to surge. Presumably that relates both to categories like appliances but also to projects, so could you give us a sense as to whether you find projects as an asset class, if you all are kicking in, and what that typically means for the forward on sales, because those typically, I would imagine, last for some time.\nTed Decker: Yes, so certainly appliances in our installation categories, we had double digit comps in our services businesses. Those are helping the ticket, but as we do see more projects, and those are when we tend to see more of the lumber and building material product in the basket, those are increasing. We watch units per basket very carefully, and for years, as you can imagine, those were going down. We\u2019re now starting to see modest increases in our units per basket, and that does speak to project work.\nMatthew Fassler: And in your experience over time, and I know it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve been able to talk about an upturn in this metric, is that something that tends to endure for a while as projects gain momentum?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Matt, it\u2019s been such a long time since we\u2019ve had this. We\u2019d have to go back and look at it. I don\u2019t know how to answer that question.\nMatthew Fassler: Thanks a lot, guys. I really appreciate it.\nCraig Menear: All right, thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jaime Katz with Morningstar.\nJaime Katz: Good morning. Following up on some of the economic questions from earlier, I know you guys usually talk about lending standards and how credit availability has changed. Can you add some commentary on that this quarter?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I\u2019m happy to. It\u2019s still tight. As we think about the recovery and the steepness of the recovery, it could be accelerated if mortgage underwriting standards were to be loosened up. We\u2019ve looked at surveys of bankers, and there has been a small, small percentage of them who have said they are loosening up on underwriting standards, but it\u2019s still very tight.\nJaime Katz: Okay, and then as a follow-on, have you guys changed your longer term thoughts on the potential of either the Canadian or Mexico business, and just any sort of added information you have on either of those businesses would be helpful.\nCraig Menear: We\u2019re very pleased with both our business in Canada as well as Mexico, delivering great performance year after year after year, so we continue to be focused on driving the business not only here in the U.S. but throughout North America.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Our businesses are very profitable in those countries. In 2015, we will open six stores, five in Mexico, one in Canada. That\u2019s proof positive of how bullish we are on those businesses.\nJaime Katz: Excellent, thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Baker: Thanks. A couple of questions on the comps, just to clarify. Carol, what did you say about the comp progression? I heard it as expenses when you were talking about it, so could you just repeat what you said about the comp progression through the year, and then I\u2019ll have a follow-up to that.\nCarol Tom\u00e9 : Yeah, I started talking about the top line. What I said, if you look at the business by half, the comps would be very tight first half versus second half. Then if you break it apart by quarter, we believe that the first quarter would be our strongest comping quarter, the second quarter our lowest comping quarter, and the third and fourth quarter about the same.\nMike Baker: I understand - okay, thank you. Then I guess related to that, I\u2019m just curious how--I guess you talked about February a little bit, but how does weather impact you guys in February? I think there were ice storms down in North Carolina, and it\u2019s been crazy up here in Boston, so part of me thinks that that\u2019s a positive - people are buying a lot of snow removal and heating and the like, but are you losing out? Would you normally be seeing some early spring business in some of the southern areas in February? How do I think about that? How does that net out? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: It\u2019s interesting - as we sit here looking out the window, we have snow in Atlanta, a dusting as it were, but--. You know, the weather obviously is there in some form every year, which is why we kind of look at the business on halves when it comes to the seasonal businesses. When you have weather, clearly your exterior businesses--when the weather is tough, exterior businesses pull back, you\u2019re able to sell through the winter category goods. Then when the weather improves, you begin to see the outdoor businesses. So it\u2019s very early on in the beginning of the year, and we expect that weather over the half will play out as it does every year.\nTed Decker: Yeah, this is our third now brutal end to the winter, and in each of the prior two we had excellent recovery. It\u2019s still very early this year.\nMike Baker: Right, okay. Makes sense. If I could have one more follow-up, the $18 billion in buybacks over the next three years, it sounds like you don\u2019t need any incremental debt to get there, in your view.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, to accelerate it, we\u2019d like to--we would obviously raise some incremental debt.\nMike Baker: Sorry, could you repeat that?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I\u2019m sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear. If we were to accelerate it and get it done before 2017, for example if we did more this year than we\u2019ve guided, we would raise incremental debt.\nMike Baker: Understood. Okay, thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: Hi guys, thanks. Can you provide a bit more color on the pro business? Historically, you\u2019ve helped us understand kind of what the trends are with some of the bigger pros versus smaller pros, and then also, Carol or Craig, to the degree that you can, can you tell us what you\u2019re seeing in some of the tests on the credit extension to the pros?\nCraig Menear: So in the pro business overall, as Ted called out, when you look at businesses that we have that are heavily penetrated by the pro, we had very strong results. We see the pro coming back. Candidly, we\u2019ve lost a little bit of visibility with the breach and changeover of cards for the pro and our ability to track that as clearly as what we had prior to the breach, but all indications that we have, as Carol called out, indicate that we had a very strong quarter with the pro and we look to see that continue as we move into 2015.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And on the credit side, for our private label credit card the approval rates for our pro customer are 71.2% - that\u2019s actually higher than the approval rates for our consumer customers, because we\u2019re coming back with a second look. If a pro applies for credit and is denied, we do a second look, and the second look has actually helped us bump up that approval rate, so we\u2019re pleased with that. The average line is $6,900, so very pleased with our private label card and, to your question, Scot, particularly about extended terms. We do have a pilot underway in a number of stores with extended terms, user terms that you can\u2019t find any place, and our pros are responding very well to that, so stay tuned for more information on that topic.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff: Kayla, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our final question from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich: Great, thanks. I guess I\u2019m going to go with a couple follow-ups. One is on inflation and then on ecommerce. There was a bit of inflation in the quarter. I assume in the outlook, though, you don\u2019t assume any. Is that correct?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Greg, that\u2019s right. Our outlook is inflation-neutral.\nGreg Melich: Okay, and then a little deeper on ecommerce - thanks for the data there. It seems like you\u2019re about a $4 billion business now. Could you tell us how it\u2019s actually impacting the profitability and the margins, and I know you had one online fulfillment center who was up and running, and you were talking about doing another one. Have we reached the point where we\u2019re actually starting to leverage that business so that year-over-year it\u2019s no longer a drag on margin? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: I\u2019ll start with a comment, and then Kevin Hofmann is here, who runs our online business. I\u2019ll let him add to it. If you look at the overall business again, please, we grew a billion dollars in our online space. We see this largely as additive to the business overall, and we manage this on a portfolio basis. When you think about almost 40% of our transactions touching and interacting in the store, it\u2019s kind of hard to parse out the pure ecommerce, if you will. We look at the margin overall in the business as a blended margin. Having said that, there are categories that it\u2019s more profitable to drive online, and there\u2019s categories that are clearly the store is the best business model. We\u2019ll continue to look at that and we continue to do things like invest in our direct fulfillment centers to be able to drive efficiency in that business. Kevin, I don\u2019t know if you want to update on the fulfillment centers?\nKevin Hofmann: Yes, so we\u2019ve successfully ramped up our first two facilities, one in Georgia and one in California, and they are doing very, very nicely. We have a third facility under construction and look forward to fully leveraging those and stocking those and delivering great service to the customer. So really, really pleased with how fast it\u2019s come online.\nGreg Melich: So if I could follow up that, Carol, if you look at the 60 BPs of EBIT margin expansion this year, do you assume that this development in building the business and those facilities is a headwind or actually a tailwind at this point?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, we\u2019ve got to get the third one up and running, so that\u2019s a bit of a headwind. We\u2019re compensating for that headwind with cost out in other areas. We run our business from a productivity virtuous cycle, and we will continue to do that in 2015.\nGreg Melich: That\u2019s great. Good luck, guys.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to talking with you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Diane and good morning everyone. Well, I've spoken with many of you on past earnings calls, this is my first call as CEO and I'd like to start by thanking Frank for his leadership and guidance over the years. Our effort as a leadership team will be to continue to drive our strategic framework and to take on the opportunities that lie ahead for our business. Now let's turn to the quarter. Sales for the third quarter were $20.5 billion up 5.4% from last year. Comp sales were positive 5.2% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.15. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.8%. In the third quarter as we saw in the second quarter, we had broad-based growth across our geographies with all three of our U.S. divisions posting mid-single digit comps. Every region positively comped in the quarter as did 39 of our top 40 markets. We saw growth in ticket and transaction in the third quarter and we were particularly pleased with the strong transaction growth as each month in the quarter had positive comp transactions. As Ted will detail, all of our merchandising departments positively comped and we continue to see strength in the core of our store. Our service businesses had comps above the company average with strength in windows, countertops and water heaters. Both our consumer and Pro businesses grew during the quarter. The growth in our pro business continues to be anchored by our large spending Pro which grew at approximately 2x the company average. So as we look at the trends across our business broad-based geographical growth, strong comps and higher ticket installed projects growth with both our Pro and consumer and strength in the core of the store, we continue to see a recovering home-improvement market in the U.S. On the international front, our Canadian business posted comps above the company average and local currency for the quarter making it 12 quarters in a row of positive comps. Comps in local currency for our Mexican business were in line with our company average yielding their 44th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Sales from our online channel grew almost 40% in the quarter and this was particularly impressive as we anniversary growth of over 50% in the same quarter last year. We saw increased traffic to our sites, growth in online conversion and an increase in the number of orders being picked up in the store in the quarter. We continue to invest in interconnected retail. Across our online properties we improved navigation, enhanced search capabilities and expanded chat functionality during the quarter. And our supply chain team opened our Paris, California direct fulfillment Center, the second of three planned direct fulfillment centers. These automated facilities will support our online growth with the balance of cost efficiency and speed in shipping online orders to meet our customers' needs. Interconnected retail also requires us to rethink space allocation within our stores. Almost 40% of our online orders are picked up in the store using our Buy Online Pick Up In Store and Buy Online Ship to Store capabilities. This year we are installing dedicated storage bays in 550 stores to improve the customer experience. The U.S. housing recovery continues to track in line with our expectations with home price appreciation and housing turnover being the drivers of growth for our business. And we have also seen improvement in GDP growth. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and our diluted earnings per share guidance for the year. Before I close, I'd like to briefly comment on the data breach. First, we apologize to anyone impacted by this. From the start our guiding principle has been to put our customers first. Our customers who won't be responsible for any fraudulent charges incurred through the breach and we will continue to offer free credit monitoring and ID theft protection to any impacted customers. We will continue to invest and enhance security measures to protect our customers' information. Finally, I'd like to congratulate Marc Powers, a 28 year Home Depot veteran who was recently promoted to Executive Vice President of U.S. Stores. Marc has been instrumental in improving customer service, making him an ideal fit for the role. The power of the Home Depot begins with our company's strong culture and commitments to its values. I want to thank our associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers based on this quarter's results over 99% of our stores would qualify for Success Sharing our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. With that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig and good morning everyone. We were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. The strength in the core of the store, growth of our Pro customers', excellent execution and seasonal events and the continued implementation of our merchandising tools all contributed to these results. All merchandising departments posted positive comps. Millwork, tools, kitchen, indoor garden, lumber, lighting, bath and plumbing were above the company average. Flooring, hardware, building materials, decor, electrical, paint an outdoor garden were positive, but below the company average. The core of the store continue to perform and we saw comps above the company average and maintenance and repair products like water heaters, light bulbs, power tool accessories, hand tools, cleaning, pipe and fittings and wiring devices. There was also strength in simple decor with comps above the company average and plumbing fixtures, decorative lighting, vanities and hard surface flooring. Pro-heavy categories continue to grow and we saw comps above the company average in insulation concrete, pressure-treated wood, dimensional lumber, HVAC and gypsum. Our millwork categories also had another quarter of great performance led by comps above the company average in interior doors, exterior doors and windows. Our Labor Day fall cleanup and harvest events provided great values and were well-received by our customers resulting in solid comps and outdoor power, storage, decorative holiday and grills. Using our merchandising planning tools, we were able to add innovation and localization within our fastener and builders hardware categories. In fasteners, we recently completed a reset resulting in a more effective mix of our private label brand Everbilt with national brands. With this reset, we also introduced a larger assortment of innovative specialty fasteners. In cabinet hardware, we adjusted the assortment throughout the U.S. to better serve customers on a local level. As a result, these categories comped above the company average in the third quarter. Total comp transactions grew by 3.1% while comp ticket increased 2.1% for the quarter. Our average ticket increase was positively impacted to reflect approximately 10 basis points due to commodity price inflation from product such as lumber, transactions for tickets under $50 representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 1.9% for the third quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 5.9% in the third quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were water heaters, flooring and countertops. Now let me turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Our strategy of partnering the suppliers to bring innovation value to the market has never been stronger. This quarter we continued to deliver on the promise with the addition of 21 new Kohler SKUs to our bath and kitchen faucet lineup. These faucets will bring the latest in innovation and style and are exclusive to the Home Depot. For our Pro customers, we will be featuring an exclusive series of carbide tipped reciprocating blades from Diablo. These blades are designed for extreme metal cutting including high-strength alloys, cast-iron and stainless steel. This breakthrough technology provides up to 20x the cutting life of standard blades saving our Pros time and money. With the holidays nearing, we are once again offering an outstanding assortment of products in our gift centers. We will feature great deals on hand and power tools including amazing values from Milwaukee, Makita and DeWalt. In holiday d\u00e9cor, we continue to bring innovation in the latest offerings to our customers. We have become the leading destination for the category both in-store and through our extended assortment online. We are excited about our lineup of pre-lit trees and have added many new styles including one that can change between 56 different light functions and color options using remote control. Finally, I'd like to mention the outstanding special buys that we have planned for Black Friday and Cyber Week. We will have extreme values for the traditional DIYer and professional customers including some amazing offers on appliances. With all of these exciting products events and great in-store execution we look forward to driving excitement this holiday season. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Ted and hello everyone. In the third quarter sales were $20.5 billion a 5.4% increase from last year. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 5.2% for the quarter with positive comps up 5.3% in August, 4.8% in September and 5.4% in October versus last year a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total company comps by approximately $109 million or 60 basis points. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.8% for the quarter with positive comps of 5.8% in August, 5.2% in September and 6.2% in October. Our total company gross margin was 35% for the quarter an increase of 10 basis points from last year. Our gross margin expansion is explained by the following. In the U.S., we experienced 5 basis points of gross margin expansion due to three factors. First, enhanced productivity and lower fuel cost in our supply chain drove 7 basis points of expansion. Second, lower deferred financing cost, drove 4 basis points of gross margin expansion. And third, we had higher shrinks that one year ago, which drove 6 basis points of gross margin contraction. Our international businesses also contributed 5 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter due primarily to higher levels of co-op and rebate than one year ago. For fiscal 2014, we would expect to report gross margin expansion of approximately 5 basis points in line with what we reported for the first nine months of the year. In the third quarter as a percent of sales total operating expenses decreased by 56 basis points to 22.6%. Our third quarter expenses included $28 million of net expenses incurred as part of our data breach. We carry a $100 million insurance policy for breach-related expenses. The gross amount of breach-related expenses incurred in the quarter was approximately $43 million. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting our known and gross breach-related costs to be approximately $27 million and after insurance a fourth-quarter net breach expense of approximately $6 million. For fiscal 2014 given our projected known net breach-related expenses of $34 million, we now expect fiscal 2014 operating expenses to grow at approximately 27% of our sales growth rate. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $113 million down $75 million from last year. The year-over-year decline is due to the following. First, interest and investment income increased by $102 million reflecting $100 million gain on the sale of HD Supply common stock. During the quarter, we sold another block of HD Supply common stock. This brings the total pretax gain on sale of HD Supply common stock this year to $212 million. We now own approximately 8.2 million shares, or 4% of HD Supply's outstanding shares. Second, interest expense increased by $27 million from last year due to an increase in long-term debt outstanding and some interest payments on state tax settlements. Our income tax provision rate was 37% in the third quarter and we expect our income tax rate be approximately 37% for the year. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.15, an increase of 21.1% from last year. During the third quarter, we opened two new stores in Mexico for an ending store account of 2,266. At the end of the third quarter, sign square footage was 236 million. Total sales per square foot were $348, up 5.8% from last year. Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter inventory was $12 billion and inventory turns were 4.7x flat to last year. We ended the quarter with $41.5 billion in assets including $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Moving to our share repurchase program, in the third quarter, we received 4.5 million shares related to the true-up of an accelerated share repurchase or ASR program we initiated in the second quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter, we repurchased $2.24 billion or 24.2 million of our outstanding shares all on the open market. For the remainder of the year, we intent to repurchase approximately $1.26 billion of outstanding stock for total fiscal 2014 share repurchases of approximately $7 billion. Computed on the average of the beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters return on invested capital was 22.2%, 250 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Moving to our guidance, for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 our sales growth was in line with a plan we laid out at the beginning of the year. And as we look to the fourth quarter nothing has come to our attention the changes our point of view. So today we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance for the year of approximately 4.8% and comp sales growth of approximately 4.6%. This guidance features total company comps of approximately 5% in the fourth quarter consistent with our plan but as you heard from Ted we are ready for a strong Black Friday and holiday selling season. For earnings-per-share remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are reaffirming fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share guidance of $4.54 an increase of approximately 21%. This earnings-per-share guidance includes a $5.74 billion of share repurchases completed in the first three quarters of 2014 and our intent to repurchase approximately $1.26 billion in additional shares in the fourth quarter. Thank you for your participation in today's call and Audra, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.\nAram Rubinson-Wolfe Research: Thanks. I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question and welcome aboard, Craig we're glad to have you.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nAram Rubinson-Wolfe Research: I was hoping you could outline some of your priorities at least to start. I don't want to put you on the spot, but just kind of some broad brush philosophies and whether you think that will be kind of subtle changes that we'd expect whether it's SG&A, whether it's capital allocation, how should we think about your outlook on things like that?\nCraig Menear: I mean I would start with the comment that our strategic framework is really built from the customer back in terms of what they expect from the Home Depot. It's clearly been a strength that we have pivoted off of. It will evolve as the interconnected retail portion of our business evolves, but I wouldn't look for a dramatic departure from any of the strategies that we've had in place. We think that framework works.\nAram Rubinson-Wolfe Research: Okay, thank you, well said. And if I could just follow-up to ask maybe Carol or anybody about the performance of the categories that you're my kind of shrinking in-store to accommodate sales online I think maybe or to accommodate sales let's say so cabinets have shrunk to accommodate appliances and carpet has shrunk to accommodate hardwood. Can you talk about the performance of the categories that have actually been shrunk to accommodate other categories whether you are seeing growth there or whether you are seeing a contraction they are in line with the footage?\nTed Decker: This is Ted. Overall we're seeing growth certainly some of those categories are shifting sales to online, but overall we're happy with the performance of the portfolio.\nAram Rubinson-Wolfe Research: Okay. Thanks. And best of luck, guys.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Chris Horvers at JPMorgan.\nChris Horvers-JPMorgan: Thanks, good morning everybody.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nCarol Tome: Good morning.\nChris Horvers-JPMorgan: A couple of questions. So can you talk about whether you've seen or you saw any impact from the credit breach what did you hear from stores what was the pros saying in September/October, September trends did decelerate and then re-accelerate pretty nicely in October, so I was curious if you saw any of that was the breach and what you are hearing in the field around it?\nCraig Menear: Chris, really it's very difficult for us to be able to determine if there was any impact. We were very, very pleased with the fact that we had positive transaction growth in each month during the quarter and I think that represents strength for our customers, confidence in the Home Depot and we appreciate that.\nCarol Tome: And don't mean this to sound defensive, but if you look at a three-year stack September was our hardest comparison.\nChris Horvers-JPMorgan: Understood, right, okay. And no real like I guess your stores aren't communicating anything up to you that's conclusive in either direction?\nCraig Menear: No.\nChris Horvers-JPMorgan: Okay. And then as a follow-up, Carol, curious if you could talk about your thoughts in November. Of course, I know you said nothing has come to your attention but you've heard a lot of retailers speak to what pickup or at least as good as sort of the trend from 3Q, so I was curious how you would describe your view of November.\nCarol Tome: Happy to talk about our perspective on November in the fourth quarter. As you know it's always tricky to forecast where sales will go in the fourth quarter because we're heading into winter. And I don't know about where you are, Chris, but it's mighty cold here in Atlanta. That being said we're two weeks into November and I must say that I'm impressed with the sales that we've reported to date. So if there's a bias in or forecast I would say it's a biased to the upside.\nChris Horvers-JPMorgan: Thanks very much. We like the word impressed. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Thanks guys.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel-Oppenheimer: Hi, good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel-Oppenheimer: First off Craig congratulations on your new position.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel-Oppenheimer: Just a quick question on expense growth, I guess maybe this is more for Carol. And I know there's a lot of moving pieces here with the breach-related expenses, but if I look at expense growth in the third quarter, was there some other upward pressure there versus the prior quarters? And then if that be the case, how should we be thinking about that as we come into the fourth quarter and then even into next year?\nCarol Tome: Sure. So Brian as we've said at the end of the second quarter, we've had a great expense performance this year. And at the end of the second quarter, we said that we expected our expenses to grow at 23% of our sales growth. But we also said that there would be quarter-over-quarter differences in that expense growth factor because of year-over-year comparison. So we always anticipated that expenses in the third quarter would be higher than our guidance for the year and that's turned out to be true. So if I look at our expense performance pre-breach, we were right in line actually a little bit better than we thought. Of course, the breach has distorted this a bit. So now as we look at our expense growth factor guidance for the year, we are taking it up from what was 23% to now 27%. So it's just a year-over-year comparison that makes some of the quarters look different, but for the year we're very pleased with where we are.\nBrian Nagel-Oppenheimer: Got it. And then as we think about the breach, are there \u2013 whether other expenses related to the breach and how Home Depot had dealt with the breach that were not captured in those one-time callouts?\nCarol Tome: Well, I will tell you there was a handful of people who are working around the clock. And their cost has not been captured. Their payroll is their payroll. But I would think if we actually put an hourly rate on that maybe we should of captured a little bit more cost. But really we try to be as comprehensive as we could. It includes legal fees, it includes the cost of credit monitoring, it includes the cost of IT, so we try to be as inclusive as we could.\nBrian Nagel-Oppenheimer: Got it. Well, thank you and nice quarter.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: We will next to Gary Balter at Credit Suisse.\nGary Balter-Credit Suisse: Thank you. Welcome, Craig to your new position.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nGary Balter-Credit Suisse: Just a question on the fulfillment centers, you mentioned I think Craig you mentioned \u2013 I mean Ted mentioned that you opened the second fulfillment center at this point. Can you walk us through what you're seeing from the stores around the two fulfillment centers you have to date in terms \u2013 are you seeing a shift to more pro, are you doing job quantity deliveries to job sites et cetera? What's the impact of those fulfillment centers?\nCraig Menear: I would start here with the fulfillment centers being set up in large part are focused on being able to have speed of parcel delivery to our customers when we complete the full rollout of all three centers in 2015. We will actually be able to hit about 90% of the U.S. population in 48 hours or less with parcel shipment. That's the main focus of those centers overall. We're still in the early days of both of the centers that are open, but pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the order fulfillment and operations of those buildings.\nGary Balter-Credit Suisse: So does that take some pressure off of the stores? Like right now how is that being sent to the customers?\nCraig Menear: Well, obviously, partial shipment goes direct to the consumer from those facilities, but our customers \u2013 we also ship bulk product as well. Our customers are choosing to engage with our stores almost 40% of our orders through Home Depot.com in the quarter actually culminated in one of our Orange box stores.\nGary Balter-Credit Suisse: Okay. And then a follow-up on the pro, can you update us on, if you track this data or if you share this data, but last year you talked about the average Pro is doing $6000 and a big effort with to try to increase that number to become more relevant to the Pro as a first call rather than a second or third call.\nCraig Menear: So the Pro customer we have seen growth in the average in the Pro over the past roughly 12 months. That average has moved up to approximately $6600 from the previous total and it's an area that we continue to focus on.\nGary Balter-Credit Suisse: Thank you very much. \nOperator: We will go next to Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman-Morgan Stanley: Thanks for taking my question. To higher-level ones. First online growth, it's been solid for a pretty good amount of time and it does not seem to be cannibalizing store traffic or sales, which is pretty rare in retail these days. Do you have a sense of what your market share of just the online home improvement industry is? And then any update whether it's margin neutral the online business or better and how you look at it?\nCraig Menear: We really don't have a good way to try to get at a full market share for the online space. So that's one we really don't have a good handle on. And then we look at the business in total on a portfolio approach as it relates to it being commerce again customer 40% or so picking up in-store. We really look at it as a portfolio approach in terms of overall profitability of the business and that's really how we look at it.\nCarol Tome: And maybe another way to look at it is just the census data because we do run it as one business and if you look at our market share from the census data, we increased market share by 23 basis points now at 27.07%\nSimeon Gutman-Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then my follow-up is regarding merchandising and some of the scientific assorting. And Craig we used to hear from you when you are the head merchant about some of the enhancements that were being made and then the one still to come. But, I guess when I hear localized the sorting and some of the things that are happening, I would've thought some of those were tackled already. So I guess granted that merchandising will probably still evolve. Can you just give us or Ted now I guess a high level of what the merchandising initiatives on the table, what are some of the intriguing opportunities from here?\nTed Decker: Sure. I would say that we've made good progress on developing the tools \u2013 the tools can always be enhanced but foundational they are developed and they have been rolled out to the merchant community. As you know we review about a third of the business each year, so while we've had these tools in place for a couple of years now, we still haven't reviewed the entire store utilizing leveraging the new tools. And I would say that certainly the second time and the third time that a business is reviewed with a tool we're going to get better and better. So when you think about localization we start with our clustering tool where we are using our online sales data as well as our store sales data to identify localized demand then we sort the store using our new assortment planning tools to that local demand. And then a newer set of tools that we haven't talked that much about and I do see promise in the future is in space. So once you have your demand and your assortment, how do you best get the appropriate micro space facing rate of sale and we have tools for that that we're starting to use. And then in macro space when we think about businesses that are shifting online or more so than others areas that we're trying to grow to bring excitement into the store we will be looking at a macro perspective in the store utilizing tools of how best to find space for those categories.\nSimeon Gutman-Morgan Stanley: Would you say it's early days with this or I don't want to put a baseball analogy to it but just try to contextualize it.\nTed Decker: I would say early. I would say mid-on the development of tools early on our usage of them.\nSimeon Gutman-Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Seth Basham at Wedbush Securities.\nSeth Basham-Wedbush Securities: Good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nSeth Basham-Wedbush Securities: Can you give us an update on your by online deliver from store initiatives where you are piloting it, how the pilot is going when you expect to roll it out?\nCraig Menear: Mark Holifield is here, I will let him address it.\nMark Holifield: Hey, Seth, Mark Holifield here. Yes, by online deliver from store were in pilot at this point in two stores and the pilot is going well. It's a very small pilot at this point. Most important thing is that we get the customer service experience absolutely right and once we are confident in that we will begin the rollout.\nSeth Basham-Wedbush Securities: Okay. So the rollout is planned for later this year or is that a 2015 event?\nMark Holifield: I'd look for that in 2015.\nSeth Basham-Wedbush Securities: Great. And then as a follow-up on the services business you guys are seeing very strong growth in the installed services. Can you give us a sense as to what's driving that? Is something in the back end or is it just strong demand across the categories?\nCraig Menear: We've seen obviously as home value appreciation has happened customers are certainly more willing to invest in their homes. I think you also see services growing as a result of you have an aging population and I know for myself where I used to love to do things. I actually have Home Depot services do things now that I would have done previously. So I think it's a combination of that macro trend and the improvement in the home values. And then we've worked hard internally to enhance the customer experience and make sure that we are monitoring how we actually provide the experience to the customer. Mark, I don't know if you have any additional comments.\nMarc Powers: This is Marc Powers. I just took over services. So I can't claim all the progress, but I have been closely involved historically with this and driving the customer experience. So we do follow-up surveys with our customers to make sure we are improving the customer experience consistently and we see we're making strong progress in that. We also interact strongly as you might imagine with our service providers and give them feedback on their performance and hold them accountable to the standard of customer experience that we expect out of our brand.\nSeth Basham-Wedbush Securities: Got it. Thank you very much.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Peter Benedict at Robert W. Baird.\nPeter Benedict-Robert W. Baird: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. First one for Mark Holifield. Mark, it sells like transportation was a little bit favorable at least Carol called that out. Just wanted you to maybe take a minute here talk about some of the puts and takes in transportation right now, you got the port issue, you've got the driver shortage issues, you've also got fuel obviously that's helping. So maybe just give us a sense of where you stand and how you see transportation as you look out over the balance of the year.\nMark Holifield: Yes, thanks Peter. It's absolutely a very challenging environment with lots of disruption out there. So we were very pleased to see supply chain contribution to gross margin given that. The disruptions at the ports in general transportation delays have been pretty difficult the last few weeks but thanks to a lot of hard work our team has been able to land our Black Friday freight. We don't see any disruption to our supply chain for Black Friday. But we are concerned over the long-haul here the West Coast ports, the rail situation, the driver shortage, all look to create uncertainty in terms of transportation rates going forward. So that's definitely a concern pretty hard to predict given the fluidity of the situation that's out there.\nCarol Tome: I will say, Peter, we have put all that into our guidance this uncertainty; we factored some of that in. The other thing that I would say is that 7 basis points of margin expansion that we received in the supply chain only 2 was fuel related. So Mark and his team are driving great productivity within the four walls of our distribution centers. The last thing I would say is on inventory, we were pleased with our inventory performance. The turns flat year-on-year given the disruption in the supply chain. Actually we've added one date of lead-time and that actually if you back out that additional day our inventory turns would have been up year-on-year. So we were pleased given this challenging environment.\nPeter Benedict-Robert W. Baird: Good, that's great color. Thank you. And then Carol, I guess is the follow-up would be for you. Help us understand how you're thinking about the dividend payout ratio longer term. I mean are there any developments out there that would compel you to maybe raise that a bit at some point or do you think 50 is where you'd like to stay?\nCarol Tome: Well, we love paying out 50% of our earnings on a dividend which means at the end of year we will look back at what we earned and cut it in half that will be the new dividend. So it looks like we will have a nice increase coming at us in February. As we think about this longer-term, Craig and I will be talking about what that optional payout should be. And you can imagine in an environment of a company that's a maturing company strong cash flow giving excess cash back to the shareholders in the most efficient way is something we should try to do and a higher dividend payout may be on the agenda, but we will be talking about that.\nCraig Menear: Clearly, we'll talk about that and we'll talk about it with our Board and make those calls.\nPeter Benedict-Robert W. Baird: Okay, terrific. Thanks so much, guys I appreciate it.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane at Citi.\nKate McShane-Citi: Thank you for taking my question good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nKate McShane-Citi: My question was on the Pro sales that you mentioned that were very robust by comping 2x the company average during the quarter. Can you remind us how much the large Pro grew during Q2 and if what you saw in Q3 was a sequential acceleration and how do you think about your market share for this large Pro customer?\nCarol Tome: Kate, I think our comments were that the large spend Pro which makes up about 30% of our Pros; they grew 2x the company average. Our Pro customer in total grew about the company average. If you look at the large spend Pro that double-digit growth would have been the same in Q2.\nKate McShane-Citi: Okay, thank you. And then my second question was just on interconnected retail and it's great to hear all of the new initiatives for that. I just wonder from a cost standpoint, we are just seeing accelerated cost for this initiative going forward?\nCarol Tome: Well, we run our business as a portfolio as we've talked to you all along. So yes, there are costs. We're standing up new distribution facilities and we have costs associated with that, but we drive productivity and other facilities to cover those costs. So it's all in the portfolio that we run to drive towards that 13% operating margin target that we set forth last year to reach that by the end of 2015.\nKate McShane-Citi: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Dan Binder at Jefferies.\nDan Binder-Jefferies: Hi, good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nDan Binder-Jefferies: My question was related to the expenses in Q3. You mentioned that 99% of the stores qualified for the Success Sharing planning and I was curious if bonus accruals were in line or higher-than-expected in Q3 given the real results this far.\nCarol Tome: Right. So Dan we are accrue bonuses based on the number of financial metrics, for the stores and Success Sharing it's based on sales. As we reaffirmed this morning, our sales growth guidance is the same now as it was at the beginning of the year which means the accrual isn't any higher than it would have been, actually less in the last year because last year we were blowing away our sales plan. So bonus expense actually was a bit of a hilt in the third quarter.\nDan Binder-Jefferies: And then my second question was related to credit. You cited that is an issue for some of the Pros in the past, have you seen any improvement on that front?\nCarol Tome: As we look at our private label credit card, we see that within our Pro segment 71% of all Pros who were asking for a new account are being approved. The average line that's being approved is about $6,900. So we feel pretty good about the availability of credit for our Pros. Now, not all Pros ask for a private label card and so we understand that providing credit to this important customer is really important and we are looking at other ways in which we might get credit to them besides our private label card is there some other sort of financing vehicle that we should be providing so we're exploring that.\nDan Binder-Jefferies: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser at UBS.\nMichael Lasser-UBS: Good morning thanks a lot for taking my question. As you've seen, really strong results in the category such as appliances, flooring which are areas that you focused intently on in the last couple of years. What have you learned that you can now extend to other areas that maybe you haven't previously shared about your ability to take market share in new and upcoming ways?\nTed Decker: Well, one of the key things and maybe obvious as much as we talk about interconnected retail, but you never would've thought appliances would be as strong as it is as an online category. Even flooring one of the key products that we're moving into our new DF facilities is hard surface flooring so customers quite happy to order complete flooring jobs and direct delivery to the home. So I think that's a key learning that the interconnected -- the online experience can both be educational and inspirational, but also be used for commerce on big-ticket items like flooring and appliances.\nCraig Menear: I think the other comment I have is really important for us to be working closely with our manufacturers' to continue to drive the innovation in the product that delivers value to our customers. And I think there are opportunities around the store to continue to focus on that and we will. We put pretty strong emphasis in a few key categories that we put a stake in the ground LED technology, lithium technology we've seen great results in those businesses as a result of that focus with our key suppliers. And I think that something we have to continue to do.\nMichael Lasser-UBS: Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up question is, we see the results of some of your competitors who are struggling whether it's those that are specialized within the flooring category or those that are trafficking and some of the categories that you also traffic and yet are attached to \u2013 predominantly attached to malls. It's probably easy to assume that some of your strong performance of mid-single digit comps along with gross margin expansion is due to the results of those competitors. So what do you expect moving forward? Do you expect that there will be any change in the competitive environment and your strong performance is sure to attract some attention and may influence some competitive response are you preparing for that?\nCraig Menear: I think historically, candidly in the retail business, the competitive environment changes on an ongoing basis. And that's actually what's really fun about the retail business. And so we fully anticipate ongoing that across multiple different segments that we compete against that the market will react and moved and likewise so will we. And we remain focused on continuing to take share.\nMichael Lasser-UBS: Okay. Thank you very much and best of it luck to everyone in the new positions.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Scot Ciccarelli at RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli-RBC Capital Markets: Hi, guys. You talked about \u2013 earlier in the call you talked about some of the success that you've had with your Pro customer. And Carol I know you just mentioned credit extension in another question, but what other key initiatives are you guys implementing to drive share gains with the Pro customer number one and number two are you doing anything that's materially different today than you were maybe a year or two ago to drive those share gains?\nCraig Menear: I will let Marc.\nMarc Powers: Hey, this is Marc Powers. So we're focused strongly inside the store on building those relationships with our Pros and making sure that we are taking some of the friction if you will out of their transactions and dealing with us with Home Depot. You might have already heard about our program with Pro Xtra. Last quarter I think we called out that we had 1.7 million members of Pros who signed up for Pro Xtra to receive special buys of the week. Also different services that we are providing to them such as being able to return product in our stores without any receipts which takes a lot of friction out of their day in and day out transactions with us and now we're up to 2.5 million actually Pros who are participating in Pro Xtra. So we're very pleased inside the store with our focus with that Pro customer segment and also outside the store we're seeing some strong traction and building relationships with our outside sales force as well.\nScot Ciccarelli-RBC Capital Markets: And how big is that sales force at this point, Marc?\nMarc Powers: Right now, we're \u2013 I believe we're approximately 150 associates in our exterior sales force.\nCarol Tome: Those salespeople who are really attached to our high spend Pros pretty good dug on important \u2013 the average spend for a high spend Pro is on average close to $30,000 a year.\nScot Ciccarelli-RBC Capital Markets: Excellent. All right, thanks guys.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Dennis McGill at Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill-Zelman & Associates: Hi, good morning and thank you. First question just has to do with Canada, it looks like you posted pretty strong numbers there for the last four to six quarters and just curious whether you think that momentum is sustainable and how much of that would you attribute to market as opposed to market share?\nCraig Menear: I think first of all Bill and his team in Canada have done an outstanding job of driving the business in Canada and we look to see that continue that kind of performance. We think there's a lot of opportunities to continue to bring great value to our Canadian customers and drive for share gains in the market.\nDennis McGill-Zelman & Associates: Right. Do you feel like right now it's share gain any sense of how much of it is share versus market?\nCraig Menear: That's pretty tough to tell. I would say I don't know that the Canadian market ever got quite as difficult as the U.S. market, but certainly they had their bumps along the way as well, but it's pretty tough to tell the difference on those.\nCarol Tome: We feel so good about Canada though that we are opening a store in Canada this year. We haven't opened a store in Canada for a number of years.\nDennis McGill-Zelman & Associates: Okay. And then Carol can you just review appliance performance in the quarter, however, if you want to phrase it relative to comps are just absolute?\nCarol Tome: Sure. Appliances grew the company average for the quarter. For the year appliances that contributed 20 basis points of our comp growth.\nDennis McGill-Zelman & Associates: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew Fassler at Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler-Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot and good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nMatthew Fassler-Goldman Sachs: My question is really focused on inventory. Carol, the inventory was up a bit more than in the past. You talked about adding I guess a day to back stock or having some plan to increase, can you just kind of contextualize that for us? Talk to us about how long you would expect that to persist?\nCarol Tome: Right. Well, as Mark described the challenges within the supply chain disruption are real. They are real for all retailers. And so this additional day contributed probably $120 million to $140 million of inventory. We also had some air movement inventory that we are carrying over a small amount less than $100 million, but because of the cool summer we didn't sell through all of our air movements. We are carrying that over and we will sell it next year, but there are no markdown risk. But as a result of these factors, we aren't going to get us much productivity out of inventory this year as we had planned. But we feel great about our inventory position and as we look towards 2015, we're planning for inventory improvement. And Mark do want to give anymore color to that?\nMark Holifield: I think you said it pretty well, Carol. I think the most important thing about our inventory is that customer service begins with us being in stock and we are always going to pursue that first and make sure that our inventory productivity comes right after that.\nMatthew Fassler-Goldman Sachs: Thank you so much, guys.\nOperator: We will go next to Mike Baker at Deutsche Bank.\nMike Baker-Deutsche Bank: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask two questions one on the appliances as you said in line with company average, but where are you on adding the jumbo resets and those types of things? Do you have more of those then you did a year ago and where is that going? And then my second unrelated question if I could, is really just thinking about next year and I understand from a macro standpoint that you guys think a lot of the top line is driven by home price appreciation rather than existing home sales and I agree with that, but existing home sales have been down 11 months in a row. How long can you continue to comp at 4.5 plus with declining existing home sales? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: Well, I will answer the last question and then Ted maybe you answer the first question. If we think about our 2014 growth it starts with GDP. The forecast for this year is 2.2%. We had to that about 200 basis points of growth coming out of home price appreciation in housing turnover. That gets us to 4.4 and then there's about another 4/10 of growth coming from areas like appliances. That gets us to the 4.6% comp that we guided for the year. As we look to 2015 then we would look at GDP. GDP economists tend to want to be at 3%, so that's sort of looking like right now in the 3% area. We tend to believe we will get help from housing because it's not turnover while down is still up as a percent of units 4% of units are turning, so if we will get help from turnover, we will get help from home price appreciation not as robust as it was last year, but it will continue to recover because it has not fully recovered. And then lastly, we are very encouraged by the recent news that's coming out of the FHFA as well as a number of regulators who are really trying to address mortgage financing reform. While this has yet to turn into additional liquidity in the mortgage underwriting market, the news has been very good. And we believe that could be a real bolster to our industry. If you look at homes that were sold or financed through cash that dropped to 24% in September, which means more people need loans, they need mortgages and so mortgage financing reform is really important for our industry and very encouraged with the recent news. Now Ted on jumbo?\nTed Decker: Yes. On appliances so yes we comped in line with the company average but third-party reporting would suggest we took some decent share in the quarter, so we are pleased with that performance. We have over 1000 showrooms now that we have expanded the footprint. We started this over two years ago about a quarter of those, 1000 are the bigger showroom that we call jumbo and that's where we essentially doubled the space of the appliance showroom and the balance of 750 odd are a Bigfoot where we only go up about 30%. So we've done about 1000. We may we will continue to look at the performance and we won't certainly do every last door with an expanded showroom but we probably have a few more that we can take a look at.\nMike Baker-Deutsche Bank: Okay, thanks for the color. Very helpful. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We will go next to Greg Melich at Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich-Evercore ISI: Hi. Thanks. I had a couple of follow-ups. If you look at the inventory Carol that additional day, did that change the $800 million working capital benefit that you were expecting for this year? And then I wanted to follow-up on the Pro side.\nCarol Tome: Yes, we are not expecting $800 million of working capital benefit. I would knock that off by a couple hundred million.\nGreg Melich-Evercore ISI: Okay, great. And then on the Pro side, you mentioned some of the things you are doing in credit. Could you just remind us how many of your Pros have signed up for your traditional private label card and how the pilot is going with the extended credit program?\nCarol Tome: That's a very great question but for competitive reasons not going to share that number with you.\nGreg Melich-Evercore ISI: All right, can I do it a different way.\nCarol Tome: You can try.\nGreg Melich-Evercore ISI: If you look at your large Pros and look at the ones that are spending at $6600 right now what share of wallet do you think you have with your typical Pro?\nCraig Menear: That's a pretty difficult number. We talk about it a lot but it's a really difficult number to quantify. We know there is upside opportunity. Let's put it that way.\nGreg Melich-Evercore ISI: I tried, Craig. Good luck everyone.\nCarol Tome: We've shared this data in the past we had a 5% increase in the average ticket for Pros or three more transaction that is a $1.2 billion opportunity so maybe that helps size it.\nGreg Melich-Evercore ISI: It does. And just on the pilot if it does work when would you expect to roll that further on the credit offering?\nCarol Tome: We will talk to you about that when we are ready to talk to you about it.\nGreg Melich-Evercore ISI: All right thanks. Have a great holiday.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Thanks.\nOperator: And we will move next to Eric Bosshard at Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard-Cleveland Research Company: Good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nEric Bosshard-Cleveland Research Company: Two things. First of all in terms of the categories below plan or should not below plan but below average anything that you would draw from those are any insights as you look at the ones that are below average that you would conclude from that?\nCarol Tome: I will give you one data point perhaps if I could and then Ted can give you more color. If you look at the selling departments that Ted talked about nine of 16 were 100 basis points of the average comp, so it was very narrowly bound.\nTed Decker: Yes. I wouldn't say there's a particular theme probably the category that is suffering from the mild weather is roofing so that would be a category we're happy with the business, but there have been no storms, there hasn't been a lot of inclement weather so the demand is that is lower and in life goods again the drought in the West Coast and the very mild summer in the north so you didn't get a lot of burnout of lawns and reseeding et cetera. Those really are the only things.\nEric Bosshard-Cleveland Research Company: Okay. And then secondly, you commented or someone made a comment about appliances and promotions during the month of November around Black Friday or Cyber Week. From a promotional standpoint where are you in that category or across the store. I can see what your gross margin expectations are, but anything different or material going on in terms of your promotional intensity?\nTed Decker: No, the promotions are very similar to last year. We ran what we're calling a pre-Black Friday appliance event for largely the month of November and we're like-for-like to last year. \nEric Bosshard-Cleveland Research Company: Perfect. Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff: Audra, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And we will take that question from Laura Champine at Canaccord.\nLaura Champine-Canaccord: Good morning. Carol when you last spoke to the guidance level at 4.54 for the year. Were you already contemplating a $0.05 benefit from selling HD Supply shares and if not why not raise the guidance by $0.05 other than maybe some wiggle room?\nCarol Tome: Yes, Laura, that was contemplated in the guidance that we've given. Now we've issued a lot of press releases recently but we've had the 4.54 in for a while and that included the gain on sale of HD Supply.\nLaura Champine-Canaccord: Got it. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: You are welcome. End of Q&A\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking with you at the end of the fourth quarter in February.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you would like to ask a question during today\u2019s call, please press the star key followed by the digit one on your touchtone phone. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you, Audra, and good morning to everyone. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of the Home Depot; Craig Menear, President, U.S. Retail; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analysts\u2019 questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors, and as a reminder we would appreciate it if participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up, please. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call the Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387770-384-2387. Now before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentation may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. A reconciliation of these measurements is provided on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $23.8 billion, up 5.7% from last year. Comp sales were positive 5.8% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.52. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 6.4%. We saw broad-based growth in the quarter across all of our geographies. All three of our U.S. divisions posted mid-single digit comps with the variance of performance within 100 basis points of each other. We\u2019re pleased with these results since we were anniversarying double-digit comps in the second quarter of last year. Every region positively comped, as did 38 of our top 40 markets. Our Mexican business positively comped for the quarter, making it 43 quarters in a row of positive comps, and our Canadian business continues to perform well with positive comps for the 11th consecutive quarter. Our dot-com business had sales growth of over 38%. This was a slight deceleration from the first quarter but it was well ahead of our plan. This quarter, our sales comparison included the full roll-out of buy-online, ship to store which we launched last year. While our year got off to a slow start because of the late spring, we ended the first half with sales in line with our original expectations. We believe the housing market remains a modest tailwind for our business. We had growth in transactions and ticket for both the quarter and the half. Both our consumer and pro businesses grew. Our installation services business, which is high ticket and tends to be on the discretionary end of spending, had a strong quarter, and as Craig will detail, we saw an acceleration of big ticket transactions. These results support the view of a continuing recovery in the U.S. home improvement market. Consensus GDP forecasts call for modest growth for the year, and though the housing data is mixed, we believe home price appreciation is an important positive for our business. Price appreciation isn\u2019t setting the pace of last year, but it\u2019s still going in a positive direction consistent with our expectations at the start of the year. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and increasing our earnings per share guidance for the year to reflect our outperformance this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication. A successful spring season for us requires flexibility in a difficult environment, and our associates met the challenge. This half, over 97% of our stores qualified for success sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. We\u2019re proud of this result and hope to do even better in the second half. With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thanks Frank, and good morning everyone. We were pleased with our results in the second quarter and saw continued strength in the core of the store in maintenance and repair categories. Our online business continued to show strong growth and our pro and service businesses had another quarter of solid performance. We also experienced a rebound in our seasonal businesses as spring broke across the country. I would like to thank our store associates as well as our inventory planning, replenishment and supply chain teams who responded to this surge in seasonal sales. Because of them, we were able to deliver a great quarter and we had some of our highest customer service scores in history for the second quarter. This is particularly notable given the fact that we had a record number of customer transactions. From a geographic perspective, all three U.S. divisions had positive comps and beat their sales plan. All departments had positive comps for the quarter. The departments that outperformed the company\u2019s average comp were tools, millwork, outdoor garden electrical, and kitchens. Baths, d\u00e9cor, plumbing, hardware, paint, building materials, indoor garden, flooring, lighting, and lumber were at or below the company average, all at mid-single digit comps. The core of the store continued to perform well as we saw strength in maintenance and repair categories across the country. Appliance parts, HVAC, hand tools, power tool accessories, water heaters and light bulbs all had double-digit comps. Pro heavy categories like windows, concrete, insulation, pressure treated wood, studs, fasteners, pipe and fitting, and gypsum had comps above the company average. Seasonal outdoor categories regained strength in the quarter. We lost some sales in air movement categories due to the cooler summer and in live goods in drought-affected areas. However, sales in exterior stains, water sealers, grills, seed, soils, mulch, and live goods in non-drought affected areas more than made up for the loss. In simple d\u00e9cor, vanities, decorative lighting, fixtures and hard surface flooring led by laminate, tile and hardwood all had comps above the company average. Appliances also had another quarter of outperformance, posting double-digit comps. Total company transactions grew by 4.1% for the quarter while comp ticket increased 1.7%. Our average ticket increase was negatively impacted by commodity price deflation mainly from lumber and copper. The total impact to ticket growth from commodity price deflation was approximately negative 10 basis points. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.1% for the second quarter. Transactions per tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 8.4% in the second quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were appliances, windows, water heaters, wood and laminate flooring. Our pro business was strong across the country. Total pro sales grew at approximately the company average, but sales from our high spend pro customers, which we define as those who spend more than $10,000 a year with us, grew above the company average for the tenth quarter in a row. Our services business also had another great quarter, posting comps over twice the company average. In services, solar, window, HVAC and counter top installations were the main sales drivers during the quarter. We continue to drive efficiency through multiple initiatives. While in the early days, our new merchandising tools are starting to deliver benefits. For example, we can use clustering to better assort stores with similar attributes. One category where we have seen this success is in water heaters that were assorted based on local preferences, regulations and demographics, and as previously mentioned this category had double-digit comps for the quarter. We have also changed the way we communicate with our customers and had shifted our approach to support a more targeted, personalized messaging to become more relevant to the customer. As a result, costs attributable to traditional print advertising have been reduced by over 60% since 2010 and have been shifted to a more efficient digital delivery method. Now let me turn our attention to the merchandising and operational activities in the third quarter. We continue to drive leadership in LED technology and are excited about the launch of our new lightbulb reset that will expand our presence and holding capacity in the category. This reset will add 25 new SKUs to our assortment and provide for a better, more intuitive shopping experience for the customer. We\u2019re also introducing new products for the connected home, including garage door openers, thermostats, water heaters, and light bulbs. In addition to these new products, we have an incredible line-up of great values and special buys for our Labor Day and fall clean-up events. Finally, we continue to enhance the customer service experience in our stores and provide our associates the tools necessary to do so. In the second half of 2014, we are introducing the next generation of our First Phone, which is an associate and customer service tool. It will allow for internet access to assist with questions and online orders and will be equipped to complete the check-out process in aisle for our customers. These exciting products, events and tools will allow our associates to be ready for success in the third quarter. Before I turn the call over to Carol, I would like to congratulate Ted Decker, who was recently promoted to Executive Vice President of Merchandising. Ted brings a wealth of knowledge and Home Depot experience to this role. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Craig, and hello everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $23.8 billion, a 5.7% increase from last year. Our total company comps, or same store sales, were positive 5.8% for the quarter with positive comps of 6% in May, 4.4% in June, and 6.8% in July. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total company comps by approximately 50 basis points. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 6.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 6.6% in May, 5% in June, and 7.3% in July. We were particularly pleased with our U.S. comp performance given that last year, we posted an 11.4% positive comp in the second quarter. Our total company gross margin was 34.3% for the quarter, a decline of 1 basis point from last year. We saw a considerable amount of movement in our gross margin during the quarter as explained by the following factors. First, we experienced 16 basis points of gross margin expansion due primarily to higher levels of co-op and rebate and a modest positive impact from sales mix changes. This gross margin expansion was offset by 11 basis points of contraction due to higher shrink than one year ago, and by six basis points of deleverage coming from our supply chain as we, like many companies, faced higher transportation costs. For the first six months of the year our gross margin was essentially flat from the prior year, and for fiscal 2014 we expect our gross margin rate to be up a few basis points from what we reported in fiscal 2013. In the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 109 basis points to 19.8%. While our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth, we also experienced lower expenses year-over-year in several areas, including workers\u2019 compensation. Further, management bonus expense was $66 million less than last year given relative year-over-year performance. Based on our year-to-date experience and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are now projecting our fiscal 2014 expenses to be lower than what we thought at the beginning of the year. As a result, we are projecting our fiscal 2014 expenses to grow at approximately 23% of our sales growth rate. We would expect our expense growth ratio to be higher than our guidance in the third quarter and closer to our guidance in the fourth quarter given year-over-year comparisons. Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $191 million, a $19 million or 11% increase from last year. The year-over-year change reflects two items. First, interest expense increased by $34 million due primarily to interest associated with long-term debt. Year-over-year, we have increased our outstanding debt by $4 billion, including $2 billion of long-term debt issued in June of this year. Second, interest and investment income increased by $15 million in the quarter, reflecting an additional gain on sale of HD Supply common stock. This brings the total pretax gain on sale of HD Supply common stock to $112 million or approximately $0.05 of earnings per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2014, of which $0.04 was recognized in the first quarter and $0.01 was recognized in the second quarter. We now own approximately 11.8 million shares of 6% of HD Supply outstanding shares. Our income tax provision rate was 37.1% in the second quarter and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year. Net earnings for the second quarter were $2.1 billion, the highest quarterly net earnings in our company\u2019s history. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.52, an increase of 22.6% from last year. During the second quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico for an ending store count of 2,264. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 236 million and total sales per square foot were $404, up 5.5% from last year. Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter inventory was $11.7 billion and inventory turns were 4.9 times, flat to last year. We ended the quarter with $43.5 billion in assets, including $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Moving to our share repurchase program, in the second quarter we repurchased $2.25 billion or 23.1 million of our outstanding shares. This included 6.2 million shares repurchased in the open market and 16.9 million shares repurchased through an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR program. For the shares repurchased under the second quarter ASR program, this is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon completion of the ASR in the third quarter. For the remainder of the year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash and the proceeds from $2 billion of long-term debt issued in June for total fiscal 2014 share repurchases of $7 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 21.9%, 280 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Moving to our guidance, there are mixed signals in the housing data but our planning assumptions remain intact. As we look to the back half of the year, we believe we will continue to report solid sales gains and the sales plan we laid out at the beginning of the year is well within sight. Today, we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance for the year of approximately 4.8% and comp sales growth of approximately 4.6%. We expect a rate of comp growth for the back half of the year to be about 80 basis points higher than the rate of comp growth we experienced in the first half of the year. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are lifting fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share growth guidance by $0.10 and now expect fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 20.2% to $4.52. Our updated earnings per share guidance reflects our second quarter performance as well as the impact of raising our 2014 share repurchase target from had been $5 billion to now $7 billion. So we thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call, and Audra, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Aram Rubinson at Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi, this is (Chris Vodiclari) [ph] on for Aram. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a question about if you could tell us about your decision-making process that you\u2019re using to deploy and optimize space in your stores. Specifically we\u2019re wondering, we\u2019ve seen you reset patio, flooring, cabinets. What are the other glaring opportunities? What figures internally tell you that space allocation is making a difference? And lastly, if you were to change the allocation overnight, what do you think the ultimate potential could be in terms of sales per square foot, or anything else you could tell us? Thank you.\nCraig Menear: So Chris, from a space allocation standpoint, we obviously use both our financial systems as well as our plan-o-gram software systems to be able to make decisions on the productivity of space. The investments we\u2019ve made in our merchandising tools are there to allow for our merchants to make assortment decisions that improve the productivity of obviously the space that we dedicate to our assortments. You have seen us make trade-offs, as you pointed out, in terms of allocation shifts within patio in this case as we\u2019ve seen customers gravitate to the online space and the ability to customize their own product through the offerings that we have digitally that would be much more difficult to execute in a store environment, or in spaces like kitchens where the customer\u2019s shopping pattern has changed in terms of how they begin to shop for kitchens, and we could take some space out of kitchens, for example, and either apply that to an expansion of our assortment in appliances, or for that matter our hard surface flooring. So those are the type of trade-offs that we\u2019ll make on a consistent basis and look for opportunities to continue to drive productivity overall in our store, but for our sales in total.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And to your question as to how high is up, well, that\u2019s for us to figure out; but if we just look at appliances, for example, we have our expanded assortment in over 800 of our stores. We\u2019re rolling to another 183 stores, and appliances contributed 50 basis points of our comp growth in the second quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Dan Binder at Jefferies.\nDan Binder \u2013 Jefferies: Hi, good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter. My question was - I had two questions, one around just the momentum you\u2019re seeing at the end of the quarter. Anything that you would attribute to that, any promotional events, and has that continued into Q3?\nCraig Menear: So when we look at the quarter and through the months, very, very pleased, Dan, with the breadth of growth, if you will, across the store. Probably one of the tightest quarters in terms of when we look at all of our departments, the lowest comping department was north of 4% and the spread was pretty narrow, so we\u2019re very, very pleased with the productivity across all of our merchandising departments and also across all of our geographies.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And as we look into our performance for August, you may recall that last year our comp in August was 8.7%, so we\u2019re up against our hardest comparison, and we are very pleased with our sales performance.\nDan Binder \u2013 Jefferies: Great. My second question, if I could, was just around the SG&A. The lower incentive comp was detailed. I was wondering if you\u2019d give us any color around the worker\u2019s comp impact to the quarter.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure, I\u2019d be happy to. We\u2019ve really worked - Marvin and team has done a marvelous job of working on really making our stores a place where we have fewer injuries, et cetera, so our workers\u2019 compensation expense was $42 million, down year-on-year.\nDan Binder \u2013 Jefferies: Great, thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley.\nJoshua Siber \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Good morning, this is Joshua Siber on for Simeon. Congratulations on a great quarter. So outside of the lower workers\u2019 comp, you guys posted nearly flat SG&A dollar growth versus nearly 6% sales growth. Just outside of the workers\u2019 comp, do you guys attribute that expense control to anything else?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: There were a few other items I would call out \u2013 a legal settlement that we had last year of $23 million that didn\u2019t repeat this year. But broadly speaking, we have a productivity cycle that drives our economic engine, and we have a laser focus on just making sure that we\u2019ve got outstanding expense control. You can see that in the results.\nJoshua Siber \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Okay, if you don\u2019t mind if I sneak one more in, just curious how have customers responded to a dedicated space for online orders? Have you guys seen a pick-up in the pro business because of this?\nCraig Menear: Roughly about a third of our online transactions culminate in a store, and that is split across both consumer and pro.\nJoshua Siber \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Kate McShane at Citi Research.\nKate McShane \u2013 Citi: Thanks, good morning. For Q2, we assume that some of the comp benefit was some storm-related damage sales. Do you expect to still see some impact from this in Q3?\nCraig Menear: The overall storm comp from a year ago as you\u2019re moving into Q3 is very, very small. We\u2019ve pretty much cycled through it as we\u2019ve come off of Q2.\nFrank Blake: Are you referring, Kate, to the damage from the winter that we had?\nKate McShane \u2013 Citi: Yes, damage from the winter.\nFrank Blake: It\u2019s hard, to be honest, to tease that out in the numbers. I mean, what you saw was a very strong recovery of our outdoor garden business, but we\u2019re not able to pinpoint what percent of that came from storm damage.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And to Craig\u2019s comment about the storms that we\u2019re anniversarying from Superstorm Sandy, this might be helpful to you. If you look at our six-month comp in the United States, it\u2019s a 5% comp. We had about 50 basis points of pressure in that comp coming from the Superstorm Sandy overlap, and to Craig\u2019s point, we will be through that beginning in Q3.\nKate McShane \u2013 Citi: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Good morning. Congratulations on another very nice quarter. Question I had \u2013 you called out big ticket as a driver here, and I think in response to one of the other questions, you mentioned appliances; but the question I have is maybe give us a little more color around either the ongoing strength you\u2019re seeing in the appliance category, or if you\u2019re seeing big ticket of another nature start to inflect higher here at this point in the cycle.\nCraig Menear: We were very pleased, Brian, with our performance in appliances, double-digit comp growth, as Carol mentioned, 50 basis points of overall comp contribution. That\u2019s a result of obviously the expanded assortments and the expanded showroom. We also believe we\u2019re delivering great value in our events that we put into play there, but also in big ticket we\u2019ve seen a nice recovery in the millwork business as customers clearly feel better about investing in their homes. We\u2019ve had an outstanding product in terms of our expansion and use of tools to put our new water heater program in place, as well as growth within our flooring business led by wood and laminate with the investments that we\u2019ve made into our hard set program there. Roughly, we began the year with about 225 stores with an expanded assortment; by the end of this year, we\u2019ll have about 600 with an expanded presence there. So it\u2019s more than just appliances that we\u2019re seeing, and as our large pro continues to recover, our pro is driving a larger ticket than the consumer basket on a consistent basis.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We might also just call out services because they had such a terrific quarter. They comped twice the company average, and the average ticket within our services business is $1,500.\nBrian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Very helpful. Then just a quick follow-up \u2013 market share, any color you can give us there on the heels of this showing in sales?\nFrank Blake: Well, our area, Brian, is really hard. I mean, we look at third party reports on market share, government reports on market share, what our vendors say about market share, and they would say it\u2019s going in the right direction.\nBrian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Thank you. Congrats again.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Horvers at JP Morgan.\nMark Becks \u2013 JP Morgan: Hi, this is actually Mark Becks on for Chris. Congrats on the great quarter. First question \u2013 just trying to get some\u2014we previously were talking about the potential bathtub effect and impact from weather and seasonal versus what\u2019s going on in the core of the store. Is it possible to put a number or a comp benefit that you think you captured just in terms of share shift and volume from Q1 to Q2, and then if you could give a little bit more detail on the core trends of the business. Thanks.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure. This is imperfect, but directionally correct \u2013 so in the United States, we reported a comp of 6.4% in the second quarter. We know we had 20 basis points of pressure anniversarying Superstorm Sandy, and then we think we got about a 150 basis points of benefit from the seasonal business, so that would suggest then the run rate for the business is about 5%.\nMark Becks \u2013 JP Morgan: Excellent. Then just trying to tease out expectations for Q3 and Q4 a little bit more. Previously you\u2019ve articulated comps being in a pretty narrow range, with Q4 comps slightly ahead of Q2; but given the large outperformance in the second quarter, maybe any updated thoughts?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure. The range will still be very narrow between Q3 and Q4. Q4 should be a higher comp quarter than Q3 but slightly under what we reported for Q2.\nMark Becks \u2013 JP Morgan: Great. One other question \u2013 the com in the EDI just rolled out last quarter. I was wondering if you can give us an update and some of the early results and progress that you\u2019re seeing there.\nCraig Menear: We\u2019re very early on in the rollout of the program, but it is going well. We\u2019re excited about this technology enhancement bringing enhanced visibility for our customers and our associates to special order programs, consumers being able to get that update in terms of the status of their order based on how they want to receive it, whether that be text or email. So it will drive an efficiency in communication and it will drive greater visibility also for our merchants in terms of overall performance on special orders, so very pleased with the current status of how that\u2019s rolling out. Early days, still.\nMark Becks \u2013 JP Morgan : Excellent, thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scot Cicarelli at Royal Bank of Canada.\nScot Cicarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Hey guys. Understanding that certain expenses, Carol \u2013 what you kind of pointed out, shrink and workers\u2019 comp, et cetera, will bounce around, is there a structural limit to your EBIT margins? Maybe a better way to say it is, is there a point where your historical 20 BPs of EBIT margin expansion per point of comp starts to break down?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well Scot, as you\u2019ve seen, we continue to outperform our expectations on expense productivity. At the beginning of the year, we said our expenses would grow at 33% of our sales growth rate. We\u2019re now updating the guidance to 23% of our sales growth rate, and that\u2019s really because of what we have seen in terms of lower casualty reserves coming off of these great programs in workers\u2019 comp. As we would look to 2015 and beyond, it\u2019s our point of view today that expenses would grow more in that 33% of sales growth rate. It doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t continue to focus on productivity because we will; but I would think for modeling purposes, that\u2019s the number that I would use.\nScot Cicarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Got you. Then Carol, you talked about some mixed signals in the housing market, and I know we\u2019ve seen existing home sales a little bit softer than, I guess, what a lot of us would have expected. I guess maybe the question is what parts of the market are you kind of most bullish about, and then what parts are you maybe most concerned about this at this stage? Thanks.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, as we look at the housing indicators, there are three that we pay attention to most closely. That would be turnover, home price appreciation, and household formation. Turnover is slower than what some people had hoped for but in line with our expectations, which is about 4% of units. Home price appreciation is slower than some people had hoped but in line with our expectations. For the year, we project home prices to be up around 5 or 6%, and that\u2019s how they are trending. Household formation at 500,000 households, it\u2019s certainly below what all of us would like to see. We used that number when we built our plan, but clearly we\u2019d like to see that improve because there\u2019s something like a third of the people who are aged 18 to 36 living at home with their parents. Something\u2019s got to move, so to your question, what are you most concerned about, well, it\u2019s mortgage financing availability. There has been some modest movement \u2013 there was a survey of senior loan officers, 70% of them said that underwriting standards haven\u2019t changed. Well, that\u2019s better than last quarter were it was about 74% of them said that underwriting standards hadn\u2019t changed, but something\u2019s got to move on mortgage financing reform, so for us, we continue to pay real close attention to that.\nScot Cicarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Got you. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to David Schick at Stifel.\nDavid Schick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good morning, and congrats on a very impressive quarter. Two things \u2013 first, you mentioned that you changed the communication, or you\u2019ve been changing communication with customers, making it more personalized. Any color you can give on results you\u2019re seeing real time from that, whether it\u2019s a program that you\u2019ve turned on, a specific program that you\u2019ve turned on, or a part of the store, so any of the efficacy of that. And then second, sort of related, you\u2019ve mentioned the larger pro customers growing faster than pro overall, which I think you said pro overall was in line with the average. Is the large pro growth just due to the difference in the health of those customers, or is it something you\u2019re doing specifically in targeting the larger pros, some work you\u2019re doing with them? Thank you.\nCraig Menear: I\u2019ll take the digital marketing and then ask Marvin to talk about the pro. On the digital marketing, this has been something that we have been transitioning for a number of years now and trying to drive to greater efficiency. I think specifically, you have to look at the overall results of the business, and we believe that this shift in how we\u2019ve approached communicating with the customer is a piece of what\u2019s been driving our results over the past couple years. So I don\u2019t think\u2014we don\u2019t focus on it necessarily category specific. We have programs across the store that we utilize the digital approach with to really communicate with our customers virtually in every category.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: This is an interesting data point \u2013 print will be less than 10% of our total advertising spend this year while digital is 36% and trending higher. We like the return on investment that we see.\nMarvin Ellison: David, regarding the pro, we\u2019ve been on this journey for quite a while, and when we look at the larger pro, Craig mentioned that their performance outpaced the total company, and we think it\u2019s a couple of things. Number one, as Carol mentioned, just access to capital, and we think that these individuals, because they have larger businesses, just have a greater means to borrow and to grow their business. We also believe that the emphasis we\u2019ve placed on an outside selling force the last couple of years, and we have approximately 200-plus individuals that work outside of the store and their primary responsibility is to go out and make sales calls on job sites, business locations, and really sell the Home Depot as a value proposition to these larger customers, we think that that\u2019s gaining traction. Also, we think a lot of these smaller pros in the depths of the housing recession really exited the business and started to work for some of the larger pros, so we see some of our smaller pros as subcontractors, so to speak, that\u2019s supporting the larger pro business. So we think it\u2019s a combination of just a broader economy, but also some of the efforts we\u2019ve placed on attracting these customers and kind of providing them with a better understanding of the value proposition of the Home Depot.\nDavid Schick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Fassler at Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot. Good morning and congratulations on a terrific quarter. My primary question relates to the role of credit in the store and how that ties into big ticket. What can you judge about the way the consumer is borrowing and paying for goods based on the tender, the days of the store, and what kind of response you\u2019re seeing from your third party provider on the private label credit side?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yeah, we\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing within our private label portfolio. The penetration increased by 57 basis points to 23.2% of total sales on our private label card, and as you would imagine, Matt, because we use our card as a financing tool and not a discounting tool, we see sales on that card for the larger ticket purchases. The portfolio itself is very healthy, and that\u2019s good news too, so on the approval rates, we\u2019ve seen our consumer approval rates up 182 basis points year-on-year with an average line of about $5,800, and on the pro side the approval rates are up about 140 basis points. Now almost 72% of all pros who are applying for credit are getting approved with an average line of around $6,900.\nMatthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Could you remind us, Carol, on sort of the direction of some of those numbers, the penetration, the approval rates (indiscernible) are those moving up and to the right continuously, and did you see any kind of a step change here in the second quarter?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: They\u2019re moving up continuously. It\u2019s a slow, steady move, if you will. No step change.\nMatthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Got it. Just a very quick follow-up. I know weather has come up a couple of times. If we take a step back from sort of the seasonal spillover and the 150 basis points that you mentioned, looking at a couple companies, retailers that are the most weather sensitive, some of them were of the view that the weight of weather on the business extended beyond some of the core seasonal categories and lasted a bit deeper into the season, i.e. perhaps into your second quarter period, and only would have really fully abated kind of in the June-July time frame. Do you guys share that point of view, or do you feel like the impact of weather was more limited and more directed to some of the categories that you specified?\nFrank Blake: We didn\u2019t see it, Matt. I mean, you can see with our numbers, we really didn\u2019t see that.\nMatthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Peter Benedict at Robert Baird.\nPeter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. My question is really around your efforts to drive increased pro royalty with Pro Extra and some of the CRM stuff you\u2019re doing. Can you help us maybe frame the opportunity you see on that front? I think in the past, you guys have spoken to your average pro doing around $6,000 in spend a year. Help us understand what percentage of their wallet you think that is, and where do you think you can take that reasonably over time?\nMarvin Ellison: Peter, this is Marvin. On the percent of wallet, that\u2019s a tough one. That\u2019s a tough data point to kind of vet out, but what we can tell you is that we\u2019re excited about Pro Extra. We have approximately 1.7 million members signed up. We increased that by over 200,000 this quarter, and that\u2019s been two consecutive quarters we\u2019ve signed up in excess of 200,000 new members. As a reminder, this is just a unique play for us to create a program where customers can sign up and leverage the buying scale of the Home Depot to take on some opportunities in their business that they can\u2019t afford, things like satellite roofing for a small roofer. If you\u2019re small and independent, that\u2019s a real expense that you can\u2019t take on. We can allow them to kind of piggyback us. We\u2019ve also rolled out recently things like credit protection against any type of fraud. We get a discounted background check, so you name it, we have quite a few things. Even this week, if you want to sign up, we have a great offer \u2013 25% off special order inside cabinets and countertops for pros in this program that\u2019s going on this week. So we have unique offers exclusively for these pros so that they can take advantage of some of the great benefits of shopping at the Home Depot. Very, very early days in this program. We\u2019re working with Matt Carey\u2019s IT team to make this a more robust program, and we\u2019re excited about the possibilities.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Peter, this is just math, but if we had either a 5% increase in our ticket or three more transactions per pro per year, it\u2019s a $1.2 billion opportunity.\nPeter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird: That\u2019s terrific. Thanks Carol, and thank you, Marvin, for that. Carol, just to follow up on one thing you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the transportation costs being a headwind. We\u2019ve heard that from some other folks. Can you maybe drill down a little bit more detail why are transportation costs up for you guys?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Let\u2019s have Mark Holifield address that.\nMark Holifield: Yeah, hey Peter, Mark Holifield. We were pleased with the responsiveness of the supply chain overall during the quarter. It was pretty challenging with the rebound in seasonal weather, but unfortunately we did have to spend more to move our freight. The primary drivers of that really are what\u2019s happening on the rails with declining service there year-over-year, so the new drivers of service regulations causing some driver shortage issues, and then we saw freight market imbalances brought on by diversion of cargoes from the west coast.\nPeter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Greg Melich at ISI Group.\nGreg Melich \u2013 ISI Group: Thanks. You mentioned the dot-com growth is still very strong. Could you tell us what percentage of sales it made up in the quarter, and do you think that growth that you\u2019re getting there, is it all additive or is some of it cannibalistic from traffic you would have added anyway to the stores?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, dot-com sales made up 4.2% of our total sales at the end of the second quarter \u2013 that\u2019s up 100 basis points from a penetration perspective year-on-year. Hard to actually measure incrementality, but I would say buy online, ship to store is 100% incremental, and that in the second quarter was $144 million.\nGreg Melich \u2013 ISI Group: Great. Then to follow up, you mentioned, Carol, I think in gross margin drivers there were\u2014you hit some breakpoints and got vendor rebates. Would you expect to continue to have that level of benefit in the second half, and then also what specifically caused the drag on shrink?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure. So to the impact of higher co-op and rebate in the second quarter, that was really a timing matter. If we look at where our purchases were in the first quarter versus the second quarter, it\u2019s just a timing matter. Let me give you a better data point \u2013 if you look at the impact of co-op and rebate for the first half, it was a 3 basis point benefit. Now in terms of shrink, you may recall last year we had 10 basis points of benefit from shrink in the second quarter, and that reversed itself this quarter. There are three drivers of shrink \u2013 theft, operational processes, and system inaccuracies. As you know, we\u2019ve put a lot of change into our stores, a lot of new processes and systems \u2013 buy online, ship to shore, buy online, pick-up in store, buy online, return to store, and the list goes on. It\u2019s not uncommon when you have change inside of the stores to see both shrink and swell, and that\u2019s what we are experiencing. We\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s working on this and this will be an issue that goes away over time; we\u2019ve just got to work through it.\nMarvin Ellison: Greg, this is Marvin. We\u2019re very confident in the processes and programs we have in place. We have one of the best analytical focuses on shrink reduction that I\u2019ve seen of any retailer, and it\u2019s a cross-functional effort with the merchants, with the internal audit group, with IT and operations. So to Carol\u2019s point, there\u2019s a lot of ins and outs. We\u2019ve had unprecedented process changes and systems changes the last three years, but we\u2019ve very confident and comfortable with our focus and we believe that we\u2019ll continue to get that number down.\nGreg Melich \u2013 ISI Group: That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser at UBS.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the connection between the outdoor categories in the second and third quarter. Is there any possibility that given the extended season where it was cool in July and you reported a really strong comp during that month, that that could draw away some potential sales from the fall because consumers may have been able to do projects like exterior paint in the summer where they might have been waiting for the fall, or alternatively they maintain their lawn and garden much further into the season this year, so they may have a little less clean-up than they might have in the past?\nCraig Menear: We really don\u2019t see it that way, Michael. If you think about kind of typical projects that customers do spring and then in the fall, they\u2019re very different. In the spring, you\u2019re actually getting your beds and stuff ready to plant for the spring season. That then transitions to a whole new planting cycle in the fall, and the absolute best time to plant any kind of shrubs and trees and so on is in the fall time frame so that you\u2019re moving away from the heat. I don\u2019t think that changes. Fall clean-up is a big element that drives in the fall time frame as well. That\u2019s obviously going to happen. I do think we benefited from the fact that it did not move from winter to 95 degree heat straight out of the block. That helped us in terms of people maintaining their yards through the summertime, but don\u2019t see that as a drag in what customers typically do in the fall.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Okay. My second question is on some of the merchandising activities that you did with the clustering and the tools, and you cited the example of water heaters, if you could size the percentage of your sales that have now been touched by the increased analytics, or more sophisticated analytics that you\u2019re using to give us a sense of what the future opportunity might be.\nCraig Menear: We\u2019re very early on. We\u2019ve just begun on the new tool enhancements to begin to review categories in this process. We typically review roughly a third of our categories per year, so you\u2019re here in the early innings of a three-year cycle first go round, and then we\u2019ll learn from that process as well.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: And on water heaters, do you think\u2014do you ascribe a big portion of the comp outperformance to some of the activities that were done?\nCraig Menear: Definitely. We definitely did a much better job of utilizing our clustering capability and identifying the opportunities where we could put a more productive assortment into specific stores.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Okay. Thank you very much and good luck with the rest of the year.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Dennis McGill at Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates: Good morning and congratulations. As you look at the comp in June, domestically at least, the comp in June versus July, that acceleration, was that also across the store, kind of consistent with the message for the quarter where there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of variance across categories?\nCraig Menear: Yeah, it\u2019s pretty consistent.\nDennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates: Okay. And then Carol, with respect to appliances, the strong growth this quarter, if I\u2019m not mistaken the year-ago appliance growth was maybe the best of the year, very robust. Just curious what you\u2019re looking for in the back half of the year as far as benefits from comp or the ability for comps to maintain this double-digit pace.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Our expectations for appliances in the back half of the year are contained in the guidance we just shared with you.\nDennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates: Okay, well since I didn\u2019t get that one, I\u2019ll ask another one! On the outdoor garden, any specific numbers that you can put behind that as far as how far above average it was?\nCraig Menear: Yeah, it ran\u2014\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It was more than 100 basis points.\nCraig Menear: Yeah, more than 100 basis points.\nDennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates: Okay, thanks again.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jaime Katz at Morningstar Equity Research.\nJaime Katz \u2013 Morningstar: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019m curious about your outlook for capital allocation strategy. Is there still some free cash flow to be spent longer term, and I\u2019m wondering if you guys think about either raising the dividend or paying down some of the higher rate debt; and after that, maybe a little bit more color on Mexico and Canada, please.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. From a capital allocation philosophical perspective, the first use of cash is to invest it back in the business, and this year we have a capital plan, that $1.5 billion, and we\u2019re committed to that plan. Interestingly, we are tilting our investments more toward interconnected retail and technology as we continue to try to meet the needs of a changing customer. The next use of capital is for our dividend. We have a 50% payout target, which means at the end of every year we will look back to see what we earned, we will cut it in half, and that will be the new dividend. If we were ever to have an earnings disruption, it wouldn\u2019t be our plan to cut the dividend, we would just earn back into that 50%. Longer term, is 50% the right target? Perhaps it should be higher, but right now we\u2019re at a 50% target, and then we use excess cash to buy back our shares. We\u2019ll use debt capital to buy back our shares if we think it\u2019s value-creating. As you saw, we raised $2 billion in June of this year. The after-tax cost of that debt was 2%. The yield on our stock was 2.3%, so we thought that was a great trade and we will continue to look for opportunities like that.\nFrank Blake: And Jaime, on your question on Canada and Mexico, as I indicated, we\u2019re very pleased with the results in both countries. Canada benefited from the same weather and seasonal rebounding that the U.S. business did and had very strong comps. Mexico is doing very well and has been doing very well for many, many years. The only interesting curiosity on the results in the quarter is that they were impacted by the World Cup. We could actually see the divot in sales when Mexico was playing in World Cup matches, but they still performed very well.\nJaime Katz \u2013 Morningstar: Excellent, thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Mike Baker at Deutsche Bank.\nMike Baker \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Hi. Just one or two follow-ups. On the appliances, you said the jumbo set is in 800 stores, is going to be in another 183 by year-end. Can you just sort of remind us where it was a year ago, where it began the year, those types of measurements so we can sort of get a sense as to the year-over-year change in the number of stores that that\u2019s being put into?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well Michael, first when I said the expanded assortment of appliances, we have jumbo, we have jumbo-lites, we have bigfoots. We have various themes of the merchandising display within our stores, so I just wanted to make that clarification. A year ago, we were probably 250 stores less than where we are today.\nMike Baker \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Okay, so that type of\u2014where did you end the year, or start this year?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: About 250 stores. We can get back to you with the exact store count \u2013 sorry, we don\u2019t have it with us.\nMike Baker \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Okay, fair enough. One more then, if I could. SG&A in the back half \u2013 I mean, will incentive comps continue to be a benefit to you, and are there any things like that legal settlement that we should know about that occurred in the back half of last year that wasn\u2019t necessarily called out on the call last year?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: No, I think what I said in my prepared remarks is that our total expenses we now forecast will be under our plan year-on-year, and that\u2019s because of really, for the most part, lower casualty reserves.\nMike Baker \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Right, okay. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Keith Hughes at SunTrust.\nKeith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust: Thank you. Switching back to the services business, which has done so well in the quarter, can you give us a feel for how big of a business that is now, and specifically which services are doing well of late?\nCraig Menear: So roughly about 4% of our total sales comes from our services businesses today, and we saw real strength across HVAC, windows, water heaters, so a lot around both maintenance and repair as well as the millwork space.\nKeith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust: Okay, thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff: Audra, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take that question from Eric Bosshard at Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research: Thanks. You commented that the first half in total, 1Q plus 2Q, was similar to what you had thought it might be coming into the year, but it seems like July and August are probably better or perhaps materially better than you might have thought coming into the year. It doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s weather or seasonal, but could you just give us again the insights into what\u2019s driving the business in July and August despite the macro housing indicators not being as great as one might have hoped?\nCraig Menear: Eric, it\u2019s really strength across the store. As I mentioned, we have seen pretty tight performance with the lowest department being north of a 4 comp. We\u2019ve seen strength across maintenance and repair, we\u2019ve seen strength across d\u00e9cor businesses, and clearly we had the rebound in our seasonal businesses as well. When you\u2019ve got pro reengaged, they shop across our store, and it\u2019s great to see customers investing in their homes and it\u2019s great to see them doing projects, as Carol mentioned, in our services business. That\u2019s a big ticket spend \u2013 it\u2019s $1,500 plus on average. So we\u2019re very, very pleased with kind of the breadth, if you will, of the performance both from a category standpoint as well as a geographic standpoint.\nEric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research: When you look at that and think about planning the back half of the year, either in terms of inventory or promotion of mix, or even expanding categories, any influence on how you\u2019re managing the business in light of what you\u2019re seeing?\nCraig Menear: Honestly, the plans for the back half of the year have been put in place months ago. We always would tweak and make adjustments, but the heart of what we\u2019ve got planned was committed many moons ago.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Our holiday buy was made last year.\nCraig Menear: Because we have to make those buys well in advance.\nEric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research: Great, thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to joining you on our next quarterly earnings call.\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

(Operator Instructions) Beginning today\u2019s discussion is Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you, Levi, and good morning to everyone. Joining us on our call today are Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot; Craig Menear, President, U.S. Retail; and Carol Tome, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analysts' questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, we'd appreciate if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387(770) 384-2387. Now before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks (technical difficulty) differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.\nFrank Blake: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $19.7 billion, up 2.9% from last year. Comp sales were positive 2.6% and our diluted earnings per share were $1. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 3.3%. Our sales for the quarter were below our expectations. In 2013, we experienced a delayed spring in the U.S. and Canada and we expected more normal weather for this spring. Instead, much of the U.S. and Canada had an even colder spring and this had a significant impact on our sales. In previous years, we've talked about the bathtub effect that weather can have on our spring seasonal business, where weak sales in the first quarter are counterbalanced by strength in the seasonal business in the second quarter. We expect the same effect to be true this year. As we look at the performance of our business in the first quarter, the strength in the areas of the country where more normal weather existed supports this outlook. In the U.S., as Craig will discuss, our northern division, our largest division negatively comped, driven by weakness in seasonal and outdoor categories, but in our southern and western divisions we not only positive comped, but we actually did better than we expected. There has been a fair amount of discussion about the fact that many indicators in the housing market have softened over the last several months leading to the question of whether this indicates that the housing recovery has run out of steam. As we parsed the data from our own business, that is not what we see. The core categories in the store remain strong; pro-sales continue to grow. Our services business grew high single-digits in the quarter and we had another quarter of big ticket growth. And our fundamental view on the recovery and the home improvement market has not changed. We didn\u2019t expect the recovery in 2014 to be as dramatic as last year's, but we continue to believe that home price appreciation, affordability and an aging housing stock in need of investment will continue to drive growth. On the international side, our Canadian business posted a positive comp in local currency for the quarter. In Mexico, our team posted their 42nd consecutive quarter of positive comps. They also inaugurated an online e-commerce site piloting it now in limited geographies, but eventually planning for coverage across the country. The power of interconnected retail and the opportunities it creates for us are now becoming apparent throughout North America, Canada, Mexico as well as the U.S. And we are pleased that as we invest in this area, we are seeing a positive response from our customers as indicated by improving customer satisfaction surveys and by our sales results. Our dotcom business had sales growth of almost 40% for the quarter. We are consistently seeing over 3 million visits per day and our conversion rate continues to increase. Also our dotcom presence was a contributing factor to our transaction growth. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and increasing our earnings per share guidance for the year to reflect the benefit associated with the sale of a portion of our equity position in HD supply. Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication with a special thank you to all of our associates, who have helped communities in need throughout the country as they deal with floods, tornados, and fires. Based on this quarter's results, over 90% of our stores would be eligible for success sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. We are proud of this result, and look forward to improve on it in the second quarter. With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. The extreme winter weather we experienced across much of the Midwest and northern parts of the country had a negative effect in our sales. However, in areas not affected by the weather, we are pleased with our performance in the first quarter as we saw continued strength across the store. From a geographic perspective, 15 of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps. The regions with negative comps were heavily impacted by weather and included New England and the Mid Atlantic. New York and New Jersey were also negative due to weather. Further, these two regions were up against tough comparisons given last year's strong repair sales from hurricane Sandy, which contributed about 145 million to sales in the first quarter of 2013. In the western and southern divisions we had solid positive comp performance, almost twice the U.S. average. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were tools, electrical, plumbing, kitchens, bath, hardware, decor, building materials, millwork and lighting. Flooring, indoor garden and paint were positive, but below the company average, while outdoor garden and lumber were negative. The core of the store continued to perform well as we saw strength in maintenance and repair categories across the country including the northern division. HVAC, light bulbs, insulation, cleaning, pipe and fittings, hand tools, safety and security, water heaters, fasteners, caulk and air circulation all had comps above the company average. Outdoor project categories were pressured from the weather and we saw comp sales below the company average in roofing, chemicals, lawnmowers, soils and mulches, and live goods. As we saw last year, the majority of these projects were likely to be deferred to the second quarter. On the other hand, our customers continue to complete projects inside the home. In simple decor, bath, lighting and hard surface flooring had strong sales that were driven by tile, laminate, setting materials, closets and bath fixtures. Total comp transactions grew by 2.1% for the quarter, while average ticket increased 0.6%. Our average ticket increase was negatively impacted by commodity price deflation mainly from lumber and copper. The total impact to ticket growth from commodity price deflation was approximately negative 30 basis points. Despite the softness in outdoor garden, transactions for tickets under $50 representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 1.6% for the first quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 2.5% in the first quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were HVAC, pro-sales and appliances. Our pro-customer continues to recover, and we saw broad based strength in areas that were not affected by weather. Total pro-sales grew at the company average, but sales from our larger pro-customers, which we define as those who spend more than $10,000 a year with us grew more than twice the company average. Our Pro Xtra loyalty program continues to gain traction, and we now signed up over 1.5 million pros. The goal of the program is to make our pro-customers jobs easier, and it provides them targeted offers, e-receipts and discounted business services. Our tool rental and service businesses also performed well during the quarter posting comps well above the company average. In services, bath, HVAC and window installations were the main drivers of sales during the quarter. We continue to invest in our stores from both our customers and our associates, and we are pleased that we are live in our first store with the new customer order management system or COM. This system is designed for greater visibility and execution of special orders by our associates and a frictionless experience for our customers. We are planning for the system to be rolled out all U.S. stores by the end of the year. Now let me turn our attention to merchandising activities in the second quarter. We have an incredible lineup with great values and special buys for our Memorial Day, Father's Day and 4th of July events. We continue to bring new and innovative products to market. For example, expanding our offering of LED light bulbs from CREE with an additional 10 SKUs including the 100-watt equivalent and three-way bulbs. New in lawncare from Toro is the first ever gas powered mower that can be folded and stored upright in your garage using 70% less space with virtually no fear of oil or gas leaks. For our professional customers, we are introducing a brand new Glidden propane program at an outstanding value. The lineup offers four different types of paint with both the features and price that our pros are looking for. I'm also pleased to announce that we are adding KitchenAid to our appliance assortment, and it will be available in select stores and online by the end of the second quarter. These events along with the continued productivity gains in our superior execution in the stores will generate a lot of excitement in the second quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Craig, and hello everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $19.7 billion, a 2.9% increase from last year. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 2.6% for the quarter with positive comps up 2.2% in February, 3.8% in March and 2% in April. Versus last year a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total company comps by approximately 70 basis points. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 3.3% for the quarter with positive comps of 2.8% in February, 4.6% in March and 2.8% in April. March and April comps were impacted by the timing of Easter. On a like-for-like basis, April comps would have been 200 basis points higher. Our total company gross margin was 35% for the quarter, an increase of five basis points from last year. Our gross margin expansion was driven primarily by a lower penetration of lower margin categories like lumber and outdoor garden. One other comment on gross margins, the harsh winter weather placed a number of challenges on our supply chain. The team did a great job of managing these challenges, and at the same time continue to build out our direct fulfillment capability. While some companies experienced deleverage from their supply chain cost in the first quarter, we did not. For fiscal 2014, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2013. In the first quarter operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 57 basis points to 23.4%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth as well as a reduction in certain other expense items like management bonuses. For the year we are expecting our expenses to grow at approximately 33% of our sales growth rate. Moving to interest and investment income, at the end of fiscal 2013 we owned 16.25 million shares of HD Supply common stock or about 8% of outstanding shares. Our initial investment was worth $325 million, but we impaired and wrote off the carrying value several years ago. In April, HD Supply completed a secondary offering and we participated by exercising our piggyback rights. As a result, in the first quarter we recognized a gain on sale of $97 million, which is reflected in interest and investment income. The net after tax gain was $61 million off $0.12 of diluted earnings per share. Following the sale, our equity state in HD supply is now approximately 12.4 million shares or 6.3% of outstanding shares. Our income tax provision rate was 36.9% in the first quarter and we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37% for the year. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1, an increase of 20.5% from last year. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter included a $0.04 benefit from the gain on sale of HD supply share. During the first quarter we did not open any new stores. We ended the quarter with 2,263 stores and selling square footage of 236 million. Total sales per square foot for the first were $334, up 1.8% from last year. Now, turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter inventory was $12.3 billion, up approximately $518 million from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.4 times, flat to last year. We ended the quarter with $42.6 billion in asset including $2.5 billion in cash. In the first quarter we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 15.8 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the year we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash bringing total 2014 share repurchases to $5 billion. Computed on the average of the beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing fourth quarter, return on invested capital was 21.2%, 350 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2013. When we wrote our 2014 sales plan it was based on U.S. GDP growth forecast of approximately 3% at about 200 basis points of growth coming from continued recovery in housing market. It also assumes that we would have a normal venture and that commodity prices would remain fairly stable. So, what\u2019s changed? Well, we didn\u2019t have a normal winter, but as Craig detailed and we believe that most of the sales lost to slow on the ground in the first quarter will be realized in the second quarter. While U.S. GDP growth in the first quarter was weak incentives forecast for the year are still in the 3% area. Positive statistics are not as robust as they were last, but they are materially different than the assumptions we used to build our plan. Finally, while we experienced commodity price deflation in the first quarter commodity prices appear to be stabilizing. As we look at our U.S. comp performance in the first quarter, we estimate that the harsh winter weather negatively impacted our comp sales by about 100 basis points. And that commodity deflation negatively impacted our comp sales by about 30 basis points. Additionally, as Craig mentioned, in the first quarter we had $145 million of sales pressure coming from Superstorm Sandy sales last year. Considering these factors, the run rate for our U.S. business in the first quarter was inline with our expectations. Further, May sales are robust. So today we are reaffirming the sales guidance relayed out our fourth quarter earnings call and we expect fiscal 2014 sales to increase by approximately 4.8% with positive comps of approximately 4.6%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are lifting fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share growth guidance to reflect the gain on sale of HD supply stock, and now expect diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 17.6% to $4.42. We thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call, and Levi, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And we will go to our first question from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Carol, I think you've got some people excited with that word robust.\nCarol Tome: Good morning, Dennis.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Good morning. I guess the financial question is just maybe elaborating on that if you can, especially I'm sure the question will be asked against the tough comps from last year, which I think were among the strongest of the entire year, and how you think about maybe where you are seeing that category wise?\nCarol Tome: Well, you are right. We are up against very tough comps, and our comp in May last year was double-digit, but we are very pleased with our results thus far and maybe Craig you want to give a little color.\nCraig Menear: Yeah. We continue to see strength across the store as we did in the quarter, and as the weather improves we are seeing an improvement obviously in our seasonal businesses and exterior categories.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Okay. And then secondarily on the inventory side, I think with that being up, maybe this ties into the trend, but how would you describe what you would expect for inventory turns and inventory through the year and maybe just address anywhere where there is elevated inventory relative to expectations and how that might impact margin as we move forward?\nCarol Tome: Inventory is up year-on-year a little over $500 million. That\u2019s really a reflection of the sales environment in Q1, we are starting to see the inventory come down and align with the robust sales that we are seeing in May. We\u2019d expect to have inventory turn year-over-year improvement by the end of the year.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Hi, good morning.\nCarol Tome: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: I too wanted to quickly address the recent sales commentary. So obviously, robust is a strong word here and the markets reacted favorably to that. But as you look at, as the weather is turning here and maybe more of a qualitative type question, but as the weather is turning, how would you characterize the products that consumers are buying now? Are you seeing clear evidence that there is a lot of repair type items they are buying and that maybe the typical spring type products are still to come or is there just -- now it's a catch-up to spring?\nCraig Menear : Yeah, we are seeing obviously the spring categories begin to take off. We know that landscape products need to be replaced. We are seeing sales improve in those areas. We know that in the harsh winter areas, for example, concrete cracked. So we are seeing sales in categories like concrete as a result of the repairs needed; and same thing in gutters.\nBrian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Okay. And then a follow-up question and a comment or a question on, Frank, your opening comments about the overall housing environment; there's a lot being talked or written about now just about the slower housing turn and maybe some of the reasons behind that are supply-driven. But do you see -- as you look at the Home Depot business, do you think a slower housing turn right now is a significant drag upon the business or are other factors more than making up for that?\nFrank Blake: Brian, we believe as we set out before that home price appreciation is one of the important drivers of our business that as homeowners get more comfortable that the spend on their houses that they will be able to recoup that investment. That\u2019s a big tailwind for us, and we've seen continued home price appreciation even during some softening of other housing indicators. That\u2019s not to say that the other indicators aren\u2019t important to us, housing turnover, existing housing turnover obviously does drive sales for us, but it\u2019s always worth remembering that that\u2019s a relatively small percentage of the overall homeowners. It\u2019s around -- between 4% to 6% depending on the year.\nCarol Tome: And to put it in perspective, housing turnover at [4%] [ph] of unit today, and that\u2019s what we used when we built our plan.\nBrian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Okay. Cool, thank you very much.\nFrank Blake: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Horvers - JPMorgan: Thanks, good morning. So I will try to sharpen the robust pencil point as well. So as you think about May is sort of the bounce in the landscape business, the comparison in April and May are pretty similar overall last year. So, does that acceleration mean more than sequential, i.e., is it accelerating on the outdoor business accelerating on a year-over-year basis, May relative to April?\nCarol Tome: It does. When I answer your question positively, I am referring to the adjusted April, which was a little over 4%. So May is higher than the adjusted April.\nChris Horvers - JPMorgan: Perfect. And then, as you think about sort of the underlying tenure of the business, the pro was inline overall obviously stronger in the West. Do you think that the weather did have an impact on the pro business during the quarter in the northern divisions and is that sort of seeing the similar bounce as you look at May?\nFrank Blake: Yeah. Chris, you could see that in our numbers that there is a difference with the pro in the south and west versus the north, I don\u2019t know, Marvin, you might want to comment on that.\nMarvin Ellison: Yeah. Chris, I think that\u2019s exactly right. Craig mentioned that our large pro, which we defined as spending an excess of 10,000 plus per year was very strong in the quarter. We actually saw some strength in the northern division specifically the mid western central part of that region. So we are excited about the pro business. You know we put a lot of emphasis on service in the store. We have outside sales reps that are managing those larger accounts. And we are seeing a lot of positive growth and we are excited about initiatives like Pro Xtra, which is our loyalty program which we have 1.5 million pro signed up. So we are excited that we have a lot of work to do, but we have good momentum going.\nChris Horvers - JPMorgan: And then a final question in terms of the commentary around the deflation in the quarter, do you think that -- do you expect that to flatten out for the rest of the year or what does the shape of that curve look like going forward?\nCarol Tome: Well, the good news is that lumber has actually anniversaried and it\u2019s now ahead of last year. Structural panel is down, but it\u2019s heading in the right direction. Copper yesterday was up, so it\u2019s our point of view that it will normalize and flatten out.\nChris Horvers - JPMorgan: Perfect. Thanks very much.\nCarol Tome: Welcome.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot, and good morning.\nFrank Blake: Good morning.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: My first question relates to the sequential sales trends in the South and West in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. Presumably those are regions that weren't really impacted by the inclement weather. You should tell us if there was some impact perhaps from the drought out on the West Coast. How did the comp trend in Q1 compare to what you had seen in Q4 in the second half of last year?\nFrank Blake: I got to pull up from memory where we were. What I would tell you Matt is that as I said in the commentary that both the south and the west were ahead of what we had planned for on the sequential comp basis.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Got it, and then my second \u2026\nFrank Blake: I would also note that that was even with some weakness in the garden areas because of we -- well, and also in Texas we had slower spring. So that was true even with that. So a slight -- it went down slightly from Q4, but again ahead of our expectation.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Got it. And then my second question I think is for Craig. Flooring as a category that you cited is tracking I believe a bit below positive, but a bit below the chain average. And that is a business that I guess is indoor-driven and I wouldn't be sure if there was a weather impact. So can you talk about what is going on in that category please?\nCraig Menear: Yes. What we saw was softness in the soft side of flooring. It\u2019s really difficult to lay carpet when you have snow in the driveway, because generally as they come in and do those projects that carpet gets laid out and cut in the customer\u2019s driveway. So we saw it there, but we were very pleased with the hard surface flooring sales.\nMatthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Good morning and thank you for answering my question and taking my question. You talked about the dotcom being up 40% year over year. I don't remember if you gave us our comp store sales impact, Carol, if you might do that?\nCarol Tome: Yeah. We are happy to give you just a little bit more color on dotcom sales. The sales growth for dotcom year-on-year was $232 million, now making up 4.2% of our total penetration. And for the U.S. the comp contribution is a little over 100 basis points.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay. And was there much difference regionally? Could you see any weather impact on that?\nFrank Blake: So we have Kevin Hoffman here, and Kevin is president of our online business. Kevin, if you want to respond to that.\nKevin Hoffman: Yeah. Thanks, Budd; very, very little difference regionally. Of course we saw in the south and west a bigger pick up of seasonally related categories and certainly in the north people weren\u2019t buying a lot of patio sets and lawn movers, but not as big of regional differences you would see in the physical stores.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay. And my second question really goes to gross margin. I think your guidance for the year is flat gross margin; I think you restated that this morning. You had up 5 basis points, but you had some challenges in the first quarter that you referred to from the weather. So maybe that gross margin is going to be a little bit better than you originally thought?\nCarol Tome: Well, Budd, we planned our gross margins to be down in the first quarter, because we thought we would have a higher penetration of lumber and garden than we experienced. So we were pleased with the performance of course, but it was really a function of sales. So as you think about the second quarter then, as we recover in those categories, you should plan on the gross margin in the second quarter to be down year-on-year. With the full year, we expect the margin to be flat.\nBudd Bugatch - Raymond James: Okay, as always, Carol, thank you very much for that color. Good luck on the quarter and the rest of the year.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nFrank Blake: Thanks, Budd.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from David Schick with Stifel.\nDavid Schick \u2013 Stifel: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question as well. The question is on the SG&A side; really impressive controls with the business being slower. Just if you could take us through the mechanisms that were at work there and how we should think about those at work over the balance of the year?\nCarol Tome: Well, thank you. A few things about due to the expense performance in the first quarter, we called out lower expense items and one big one with the management bonus. A year ago we were accruing bonuses with a beat to plan or now accruing that we will make plan and that goes us about $27 million. So that was one of the ways that we drove expense leverage as a function of, last year we were beating. This year we think we will make our plan. We did, and Marvin did an excellent job, and Craig managing payroll and the stores in a very difficult environment as you can appreciate. We did leverage hourly payroll as we expect that in the stores. We looked at expense items and where we could push some expense into the second quarter, we did for example advertising was under our plan because we thought why advertise into a snow storm. So we pushed some of that spending into the second quarter. For the full year we expect our expenses to grow at about 33% of our sales growth rate. As you are building your model expect the first quarter and the fourth quarter to be under our guidance, and the second and third quarter to be over our guidance. This is a function of year-over-year items and for the full year growth of 33% of sales growth.\nDavid Schick \u2013 Stifel: Thank you.\nCarol Tome: You are welcome.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.\nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the call. Two things; hoping first you can add some clarity on how we should interpret spring Black Friday promotions. I know in the past the industry has kind of moved more to everyday low price. What is the internal debate about whether or not we are moving away from that at the margin and how should we think about that?\nFrank Blake: As it relates to spring black Friday or any of our key promotional activities heavily centered around special buys; that\u2019s kind of been a strategy that our company has had from its inception to grow work deals with our suppliers, drive productivity in their factories. We use savings. We pass that savings along to the customer. So, now -- although big change.\nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: Okay, so that is not kind of a slippery slope that we are starting to climb onto?\nFrank Blake: No.\nCarol Tome: No.\nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: And if you could talk a little bit about space allocation in the stores now that you are realizing online can be a great place. I know your patio furniture is one area where you guys have pushed kind of the showroom type of philosophy. What other areas of the store are you kind of deploying the showroom philosophy? Where are you surprised that customers are taking product with and where can you steer them towards that more showroom mentality and how much space might that ultimately be able to free up in your store?\nFrank Blake: Actually I would start with -- we\u2019ve added space to our appliance business. That was a result of a change in how the customer begins the purchase process in kitchens with a leveraging digital technology that you research upfront. So in many of the spaces where we expanded on our clients showroom, we actually took that from our kitchen showroom business. As you referenced in patio we see strong sales transitioning to the customers looking for choice online. So we obviously are using that to expand as well. We also are working pilots in lighting to have a similar type effect where we can show product a broader breadth of assortment in lighting and sell through the digital channel.\nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: And just the last thing, is there a way to use technology like big LED screens or something like that instead of these large vignettes, whether it is for kitchens and lighting and things like that, to save space and maybe just use kind of an interactive display and then I will leave you be?\nFrank Blake: What I would say there is we have put an appliance kiosk or larger screen into our stores. What we have found is that it is a great selling tool for our associates and for the customers to be able to do comparisons on product. Our experience has been that there are now lot of engagement with the customer by themselves, more of an assisted sale.\nCarol Tome: In total 450 additional stores, this year will have some sort of an appliance change made to them either more square footage or another kiosk. So, yes, the technology is a way that we can help drive sales.\nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: Thank you, guys.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Greg Melich with ISI Group. Please go ahead.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the appliance point, then I had another question. Given the added stores that you have on appliances, I know that the jumbo set helped last year. Can you help us with how much it helped comp or ticket this year?\nCarol Tome: For the total company it contributed about 10 basis points of comp growth.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Okay, a lot less. Okay, great. And then I think the second question was more of a technical one, Carol. If the fourth quarter has an extra week, how come the SG&A doesn't grow as much in that quarter?\nCarol Tome: It\u2019s just year-over-year expense items.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: So, it's just start of the year or the end of the year stuff coming together. It\u2019s just you expect less in the fourth quarter?\nCarol Tome: Exactly.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Okay. I do want to ask Craig one thing. You mentioned COMS, this customer order management system you are finally rolling out. Could you just explain that from a customer perspective what is different about that when I come in and what your early results have shown?\nCraig Menear: Well, we\u2019ve just begun the pilot in the first store. But what we are trying to do is give greater visibility to the consumer and our associates to special orders throughout the process. So when they actually place an order to understand the status of that order, where it is in the process of manufacturing. And then obviously arrival to our stores and we want to be able to give that visibility to our associates in the store, so they can better answer questions as well for our consumers during that process. And it\u2019s a coordinating effort that drives back into our manufacturers, our suppliers to be able to coordinate all the way through the supply chain.\nCarol Tome: And if I can pile on, each store is like a brand. And we had these customer orders essential to the store. So if you shopped in a store in Manhattan and then we are visiting a store in Chicago, I couldn\u2019t see your order in Chicago. But now because we have a common order management you will be able to see the order wherever you shopped. So that\u2019s good for the customer and good for the associates.\nMarvin Ellison: Yeah. Greg, this is Marvin. In the past your greatest visibility was a phone call to an associate in the store for a status update and we want to give the information to the customer at their convenience, mobile device, PC, text, a lot of customer to choose how they want to receive that information.\nMatt Carey: And Greg, this is Matt Carey. I would also add that believe it or not a lot of these orders used to be faxed to the vendors and obviously a lot of opportunity for error. So we have eliminated those faxes, put it on EDI and really kind of started to streamline how those orders look.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: And if I could ask, how many of your vendors are actually able to handle this and work with you on it right now? Is it a majority?\nFrank Blake: It is all of our large suppliers have that capability, and we are working with some of our smaller suppliers to bring them up.\nCarol Tome: Yeah. The classifiers don\u2019t have it directly; they will go through a band. It will be EDI a hundred percent when we are done.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: That\u2019s great. Good luck.\nFrank Blake: Thank you\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strasser - Janney Capital Markets: Thank you very much. I had two questions. The first one, in the first quarter, you saw the big ticket decelerate. I mean obviously I'm sure some of it had to do with weather. Can you quantify how much of that deceleration came from weather and then as things kind of rebounded again in May if you saw that number bounce -- a bigger ticket bounce along with the rest of the business back into sort of the range of the 5% plus that you had been seeing the last couple of quarters?\nFrank Blake: David, it\u2019s a little difficult to quantify the weather impact, but what I can tell you is categories like roofing, categories like riders, which are significant drivers to the larger ticket were clearly softer in the first quarter. We can assume that that\u2019s weather-related.\nDavid Strasser - Janney Capital Markets: Do you think that the numbers are holding up relatively -- like if there was any sort of sense of normalization -- as you looked at May I guess, did those bigger ticket things bounce back as rapidly as the live stuff in the rest of lawn and garden?\nCarol Tome: We haven\u2019t parsed the data in that kind of detail, but we will now. We will talk to you about it at the end of the quarter.\nDavid Strasser - Janney Capital Markets: All right. Thanks. One other -- a follow-up question, as you look at May and the robust sales that you saw, how do you guys adjust the infrastructure of the business to be able to add to that. The difficulties of bad weather, good weather, bad weather, good weather, how do you adjust that delivery system and your systems and your ability to deliver to the customer with inventory in-stocks and deliveries and everything in such a sort of volatile environment I guess?\nFrank Blake: David, just two comments on that, you hit two big points of variability in our business, our labor force and our supply chain and then also our vendor responsiveness and what you saw in the first quarter of this year as well as the first quarter and second quarter last year was the ability of our teams to be very flexible in terms of responding both to lower demand and significantly increase demand and we have more Mark Holifield here who leads our supply chain effort. Mark, you might want to comment on the supply chain side of that Marvin on the payroll side of it.\nMark Holifield: Yeah. It was a very challenging quarter from a supply chain perspective with transportation rates and the weather led to a lot of issues there, but the RDC network really gives us the capability to respond along with our staffing BCs. So team work very hard and you use the infrastructure that we build which is quite flexible and we were able to respond to the weather.\nCraig Menear: David, the only thing I will add in the stores is that we partner very closely with the supply chain. As you know our payroll model is activity based. So we flex up and flex up based on our forecast of sales. It\u2019s a challenge of when you are forecasting or planning sales to be higher than the weather is permitting, but very proud of the stores, very proud of our payroll management team here at the store support center is a coordinated effort. And again as Carol mentioned, we leveraged payroll by approximately 34 basis points for the quarter. We are very committed to managing the business well and we are committed to doing that while improving service. So, great partnership with supply chain; we have to be nimble and we are pleased with the performance so far.\nDavid Strasser - Janney Capital Markets: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Good morning, and thanks a lot for taking my questions. Two questions actually; first, we can see the relationship between home improvement comps and housing turnover, but I guess when you look at it and parse it more on a category level, what categories and what product areas have exhibited the tightest relationship with that metric in the past? So, is it flooring, is it appliances? What typically are consumers doing when they are moving into a home or moving out of a home? And the obvious question is will that allow us to observe those areas and see some sense if the sector is going to become re-coupled with that metric over the next couple of quarters?\nFrank Blake: Michael, one comment I'd make is it depends a bit on the nature of the turnover. So if you go back to 2005 and 2006, one of the categories that was really the hallmark of turns and sales were special order kitchens; people would buy home, they would invest in the kitchen, they do upgrades and then they turn the home. That's actually the category for us that got hit the hardest over the housing crash. Don\u2019t expect with the housing turnover that we think is going to grow as we go through this recovery. Don\u2019t expect to get that same kind of response on turnover. Expect more the upgrades around -- you got to make sure the infrastructure of your home is right, you may paint, you may do some gardening. So I think it's going to be different as we go through this housing recovery than what we saw at the height of the housing market, and I don\u2019t know Carol or Craig if you want to add some commentary to that.\nCarol Tome: I'd agree of course, and also suggest that we should look at home price appreciation harder than we do turnover. We can turnover with only 4% of unit. Home price appreciation really impacts the way people spend money on their homes. We saw last year, if you think about pricing along a good, better, best premium array we saw growth in premium priced categories in every quarter of last year. And that continued into the first quarter of this year.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Okay, that's helpful. And Frank, just to follow up on some of your comments, there is probably no other senior executive in the country who has got a better vantage point into what is happening in just the housing market based on what you have seen in your stores and your conversations with your vendor partners. Do you have a working hypothesis on why turnover has slowed?\nFrank Blake: Well, I\u2019d say first look for the obvious explanations first, and the obvious explanation is mortgage rate increases. And you could look mortgage rates took a pretty significant jump up in the summer of 2013, and you saw a not surprising response to that in the housing market. I'd say and just to emphasize Carol's point, I'd say actually the surprising part has been how strong housing price appreciation is notwithstanding that? So, the way we look at it obviously that we think the mortgage rate increases had some pressure on housing turnover, credit availability is still a bit of an issue, it's good. The recent announcements from the government on how they're approaching Fannie and Freddie are interesting and maybe helpful there, but between mortgage rates and credit constraints we think that is what brought a bit of a damp on some of the variables in the housing market.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Okay. Let me ask one final question on the e-commerce business; nearly 40% growth in the first quarter, another good outcome, albeit a little slower than the nearly 50% growth that you saw in the fourth quarter of last year. Is it becoming harder to sustain the growth as the business becomes a bigger piece of the total or was there some other dynamic that's going on there to explain the slight deceleration? Thank you very much.\nCarol Tome: Well, I'd say first of all our dotcom business grew faster than what we planned. So we were very pleased by this. Remember, we are anniversarying the launch of Buy Online Ship to Store. So we had expected the growth rates to slow down. It was better than we thought. And in fact if you look at the $232 million of growth that we saw in the first quarter, almost a 100 million of that came from BOSS-related sales. So, this is a business that's [growthy] (ph). It's a business that we continue to invest into, because it's part of our interconnected retail strategy.\nMichael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Group. Please go ahead.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Hi, good morning.\nFrank Blake: Good morning.\nCarol Tome: Good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: You talked about the pro loyalty effort and I know there are a couple of other things you are piloting within Pro. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that and how you might think that would start to show up in the numbers as we work our way through 2014?\nMarvin Ellison: So Eric, this is Marvin. I'll give you an overview of the program. We call it Pro Xtra and as Craig mentioned, we signed up roughly 1.5 million pros. It's a very basic program. We are trying to do three things. We want to make sure that we get our Pro signed up so we can give them some exclusive offers; things like e-receipts, which will give them a more seamless return process. You know pros tend to buy more than they need when they're working on projects and jobs, and we want to make sure that returns process is seamless and easy. We give them this kind of business tools. As an example, if you are a roofer, it's very difficult for you to get a contract to get satellite imaging. If you sign on to Pro Xtra, we would give you discounted fees for that because we have a company contract. We also give them discount on things like background checks. So, just businesses tools to help them to run a better business and an opportunity to tie into things they can't afford as a small business person, and also exclusive offers. If you sign up, we work with Craig and it's merchandising team, and we have exclusive offers that we will make available only to pros that are in this club, in this loyalty program. We've seen very positive results. We've seen frequency in shopping increase. We've seen ticket increase in size of basket increase, it's very early. So we are not proclaiming victory, we just think we are onto something that we can build on, and we are looking forward to the future benefits of it.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Perfect. And then secondly in terms of promotions, I know you commented earlier about spring Black Friday, but as you think about the delayed spring, how you are thinking about managing promotions and managing inventory inflow and out from here, and what risks or challenges that might create to gross margins as we work our way through 2Q?\nFrank Blake: Eric, obviously we establish our event cadence and work our special buys long in advance, and those are set and ready to go for the second quarter. We are very comfortable with our inventory positions in terms of beginning the quarter and how we feel it will come out as Carol mentioned. We are already seeing the inventory come down at this point as we are seeing the pickup in the business as a result of improved weather.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: All right, thank you.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company.\nDan Binder - Jefferies: Hi, it's Dan Binder. I have just a couple questions for you. First, as you look at your crystal ball over the balance of the year, you have seen this bounce back in Q2 early on. As you think about the quarterly cadence, would you expect Q2 to be your best quarter or Q4 given the easy comparison? Any thoughts on how evenly spread or unevenly spread the business might look?\nCarol Tome: Well, our forecast is like Q4 would be slightly stronger than Q2, but let me just say that the band, Q2, Q3, Q4 is pretty narrow.\nDan Binder - Jefferies: Okay, and then I know in the past when you have flexibility to take the buyback up, you have taken on some debt. Just curious -- I know you outlined your plan for the balance of the year. Does that mean that you have eliminated the possibility of doing more or is it just too early to say?\nCarol Tome: Okay, and as you know, we haven't adjusted debt to EBITDAR target, if you will, of two times. Today the ratio stands at 1.8 times. It is not our intent to let that ratio continue to decline, which it will as we continue to earn unless we borrow back up. So certainly haven't taken anything off the tale. As you recall last year, we said at the beginning of the year e do $4.5 billion of share repurchases. We ended up doing $8.5 billion.\nDan Binder - Jefferies: All right, and then finally just on HD Supply, just curious what drove the decision behind selling a part of the stake versus the whole stake?\nCarol Tome: We had piggyback rights, so we followed along with the selling shareholders on a pro rata basis. And it was really -- it's a passive investment for us. So it made a lot of sense. If the selling shareholders go back to the market, again, we will follow along in a pro rata basis and just liquidate our position in an orderly fashion.\nDan Binder - Jefferies: Great, thank you.\nCarol Tome: You're welcome.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC: Good morning, guys. Two questions; first, given the correlation of your sales trends and home price changes, have you seen a change in sales trends in areas where home price gains may have slowed a bit.\nCarol Tome: We looked at Phoenix for example, because there has been a bit of a slow down in home price appreciation in Phoenix, and no, 'm not seen anything materially changed.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC: Okay. So how do you explain that just given the correlation we've seen? As long as we're kind of moving and staying in positive territory, people are more willing to spend? Is that the right way to kind of interpret it?\nCarol Tome: It's part of the overall recovery.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC: Okay, and then second, how are you guys thinking about the damage that has likely been done to housing infrastructure in a lot of these weather-affected markets? In other words, when you think about kind of your 2Q outlook, are you simply thinking about your preplanned promos and outdoor gardening kind of spring-like product categories or are you also factoring in any kind of increase from extra repair work to housing infrastructure because I would suspect that could be a driver in the near to mid-term as well?\nFrank Blake: There is certainly landscape repair that has to happen; we know that there is roof patch that will take place in certain areas based on ice damage. So we've tried to look at it in general what's planning for the seasonal categories, how does that fit in, and then look at categories that you'd think naturally would potentially rise like gutters and so on, and appropriately adjust our inventory to capture those sales.\nMarvin Ellison: Hi, Scott, this is Marvin. We have a roofing siding and windows services business. The only thing I would piggyback on Craig's comments is we have to staff up. So as we forecast increased activity we just have to make sure we are staffed so that we can meet the demands of the customers and we will see where we land from our revenue standpoint at the end of the quarter.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC: Got it. All right, thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Peter Benedict of Robert Baird.\nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: Thanks, guys. Just one question for Craig, just on the windows business, you talked about window installation being strong. Can you give us some perspective on that business where that sits today versus maybe the historical cycle? Is that telling you something about the remodel activity going on? What can you tell us about the window trends?\nCraig Menear: As Frank had mentioned one of the categories that will get hit hardened was kitchens. Likewise the window business went through a pretty significant downturn as well in the 2008-2009 area. We are seeing a nice improvement in the millwork business in total and in the window business. So we are very pleased with the current trends in that business.\nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: And is that -- is it widespread across country or is it concentrated in any specific area?\nCraig Menear: That's fairly widespread.\nPeter Benedict - Robert Baird: Okay. Thanks very much.\nDiane Dayhoff: And we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.\nPeter Keith - Piper Jaffray: Hi, thanks everyone for for squeezing me in. I think I just have one last question for you. When you were talking about the importance of home price appreciation, we certainly agree with that. I was hoping you could put on your economist hat though and maybe even looking out beyond this year, do you see a couple years of home price appreciation? Do you think it's going to slow down to 1%, 2% after 2014? I'm curious how you view the multiyear outlook on that metric?\nFrank Blake: Peter I'd say one of the underlying questions on that is the basic supply and demand equation. And you see a lot of wrestling with the question on household formation now. What happened definitely during the housing downturn was a dramatic drop in household formation. We know that there has been a substantial increase of folks between the ages of 18 and 35, who are still living at home. That creates a potential pent-up demand assuming that they eventually form their own household in their own household units that would allow for continuing gains in price appreciation recognizing that always you're looking at overall affordability as a key part of the equation, but for right now houses are very affordable, we are at really within the last 20 years this is probably one of the most affordable readings on housing you're going to see. So supply and demand equation, what's going to happen with household formation would be the real question to ask over the next several years. And we think it's going to be a positive dynamic.\nPeter Keith - Piper Jaffray: Okay, I appreciate that, Frank, and congratulations everyone on operating in a tough weather environment.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nFrank Blake: Thanks very much, Peter.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you everyone today for joining us and we look forward to talking to you at the end of our second quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Please go ahead, ma'am.\nDiane Dayhoff - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Nicole, and good morning to everyone. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear, Chairman, CEO and President; Ted Decker, EVP of Merchandising; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors and as a reminder we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up please. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Now before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call to Craig.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2015 was a record year for our company. We achieved sales of $88.5 billion, the highest in company history. We also recorded the highest net earnings in company history and fiscal 2015 earnings per share grew 15.9% to $5.46. Sales for the fourth quarter were $21 billion, up 9.5% from last year. Comp sales were up 7.1% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 8.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.17 in the fourth quarter. Our strong sales performance was driven by continued moderate housing recovery, exciting merchandising events, solid execution and a benefit from favorable weather. We continue to see broad-based growth across the store and our geographies. All three of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps in the fourth quarter led by our southern division which posted low double-digit comps. While our northern and western divisions recorded high single-digit comps. In all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw mid-single to low double-digit comps in the quarter. Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it 49 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted high single-digit comps in local currency for a total of 17 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Canada ended the year with sales over $7 billion in local currency reinforcing our position as the number one home-improvement retailer in Canada. I would like to congratulate Jeff Kinnaird who was recently promoted to President of Home Depot Canada. Jeff is a 19-year Home Depot veteran with strong operational and merchandising experience which has allowed him to be instrumental in our success in Canada. While there was strength in seasonal holiday decor, gift center, and Black Friday events, core categories were also a strong contributor to our performance. Both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. As Ted will detail, all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps and we saw healthy balance of growth among both Pro and DIY categories, with Pro outpacing our DIY business in the U.S. You will recall during the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Interline Brands, a leading national distributor of maintenance repair and operations or MRO products. We told you that in the second 90 days of integration, would be about building out specific business cases. We are moving forward on a number of exciting sales driving initiatives that have been identified through this process. For example, we will soon begin offering our exclusive paint brands to Interline's multi-family operators. We have a good sense of what we need to accomplish over the next 18 to 24 months in order to fully realize the value of the Interline acquisition and the total Pro opportunity. The retail environment is evolving and the blending of the digital and physical worlds remain a common theme. We are responsive to these trends, building out our interconnected capabilities and investing in content, site improvement and improved mobile experiences to solve for a frictionless customer experience. We continue to see healthy sales from our digital business, while also seeing year-over-year improvement in customer satisfaction scores. For the year, our online business grew by approximately $1 billion, a growth rate of over 25% versus the prior year. A significant portion of this online growth leverages the physical store assets that we have as over 40% of our online orders are picked up in stores. This is a testament to the power of our interconnected strategy. At our December investor conference, we highlighted our plans to further optimize our supply chain through what we call supply chain synchronization or Project Sync. We have been piloting Project Sync in Houston for some time and have now begun to roll out in a few other regions. Though it is early days, we have seen benefit in transportation savings, inventory turn and a reduction in product lead times. We appreciate the efforts of our cross functional teams internally, as well as the increased collaboration with our external partners as all parties involved are working together to develop and adopt engineered flow schedules that serve as the foundation of Project Sync. Turning to the macro environment, while 2016 consensus U.S. GDP growth projections have moderated, we continue to see positive signs in the housing data with home price appreciation, housing turnover and household formation being the key drivers of growth for our business. We expect 2016 comp growth of approximately 4.5%. Carol will take you through the details, but currency headwinds could result in lower total company comp growth. Therefore, we expect total company comp growth of approximately 3.7% to 4.5% and corresponding diluted earnings per share of $6.12 to $6.18. Today, our board announced a 17% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.69 per share. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create value for our shareholders. We will invest to sustain and grow our business and return excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The power of The Home Depot begins with our company's strong culture and commitment to values. I want to thank our associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers. And I'd also like to congratulate Ann-Marie Campbell, who was recently promoted to Executive Vice President of U.S. Stores. With more than 30 years with the company, Ann-Marie brings a deep understanding of Home Depot's operations, culture, and customers to the role. Based on this quarter's results, 100% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. This is our largest second-half payout to date, and we look forward to continuing this momentum in 2016. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, as sales exceeded our expectations. We saw strength across the entire store as well as continued growth in our online business. Sales were aided by milder weather and great events, including the strong Black Friday and gift center. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. Appliances, tools, building materials had double-digit comps in the quarter. Lighting, plumbing, hardware and indoor garden were above the company average, and decor was in line with the company average. Outdoor garden, millwork, lumber, kitchen and bath, paint, electrical, and flooring posted mid-single-digit positive comps. Pro-heavy categories saw significant growth during the quarter, as we saw double-digit comps in siding, pneumatics, circuit protection, fencing, fasteners, and exterior doors. Our recent assortment update in roofing continues to drive excellent results, as we saw double-digit comps in roofing in the fourth quarter. And we continue to see strength in core maintenance and repair categories, with double-digit comps in pumps, security lighting, water heaters, electrical tools, construction adhesives, ladders, and caulks. Cleaning, bath fixtures, door locks, and pipe and fittings also had comps above the company average. We believe that more favorable weather trends in the quarter aided sales growth by approximately $100 million. Our customers took advantage of the milder weather and were able to complete more outdoor projects. For example, we saw double-digit comp sales in pressure washers, hardscapes, mowers, outdoor power, concrete, and pressure-treated decking. Black Friday, gift center, and storage events provided great values and were well received by our customers. Our strong Black Friday helped drive double-digit comps in categories like portable power and appliances. Our gift center performed extremely well, and we saw double-digit comps in tool storage, power tool accessories, and hand tools. In addition, our associates rallied behind our decorative holiday offering, resulting in comps above the company average. In the fourth quarter, total comp transactions grew by 5%. And for the year, we set a new transaction record with over 1.5 billion total transactions. In the quarter, comp ticket increased 2%. Our comp ticket increase reflects about 32 basis points of contraction due to commodity price deflation in products such as lumber and copper. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.8% for the fourth quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 11.9% in the fourth quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, roofing, and special-order kitchens. Big-ticket was also driven by several installation service categories such as roofing, sheds, and countertops. Now, let me turn our attention to the first quarter. In our ongoing effort to update and refresh our assortments, we will be resetting our door lock assortment in the first quarter. Using our assortment planning tools, we were able to more effectively cluster our door lock assortment around styles, finishes, and brands. In addition, we have a new merchandising approach that highlights our brands and their complete collections. Our reset will include great innovative products such as the Schlage Connect and Kwikset 915 electronic locks. For our Pro customer, we are introducing new and exclusive products from Milwaukee, DEWALT, Ryobi, and RIDGID, all leaders in professional tools. The new Milwaukee M18 FUEL with ONE-KEY is a revolutionary technology that provides users the ability to control tool settings, track the location of their tools, and manage their tool and equipment inventory with their wireless devices. This innovative technology gives our Pro customers the trusted power of the Milwaukee brand with added benefits to make them more productive. Among big-box retailers, the Milwaukee M18 FUEL with ONE-KEY can only be found at The Home Depot. In addition to great new products, we are gearing up for the spring selling season. We are excited about our exclusive grill offers from Weber, Nexgrill, and KitchenAid. And our large assortment online offers numerous options from infrared gas grills to smokers. Our patio assortment continues to expand, including new dining set designs from Hampton Bay and enhanced offering of patio accessories. For the gardener, we are excited about our expanded selection of exclusive organics from Dr. Earth and Black Magic. Our spring Black Friday event will once again offer amazing values for our customers. The stores will be loaded with exciting products and exclusives on items like live goods, grills, and outdoor power equipment. We're looking forward to a great spring season. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter sales were $21 billion, a 9.5% increase from last year. Comp sales were positive 7.1% for the quarter, with comps up 6.3% in November, 8.6% in December, and 6.7% in January. The continuing strength in the U.S. dollar negatively impacted total company comps in the quarter by approximately $350 million, or 1.8%. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 8.9% for the quarter, with comps up 8.1% in November, 10.6% in December, and 8.2% in January. For the year, our sales increased 6.4% to $88.5 billion, and total company comp sales were positive 5.6%. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.1%. During the year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales growth by approximately $1.4 billion, or 1.6%. Our gross margin was 34.1% for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 24 basis points from last year and in line with our plan. The change in gross margin was driven primarily by the following factors. First, we experienced 15 basis points of gross margin expansion due to productivity within our supply chain and lower fuel costs. Second, we had 26 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline Brands. And third, we had 13 basis points of gross margin contraction due to a change in the mix of products sold, including a higher penetration of lower margin product categories like appliances. For the year, we experienced six basis points of gross margin expansion. In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 96 basis points from last year to 22%. Our operating expenses were $90 million over our plan. We had some unexpected expenses associated with store maintenance, snow removal, and our data breach. Further, given our sales outperformance to plan, we increased our pool for management bonus and Success Sharing. For fiscal 2015, our operating expense as a percent of sales was 20.9%, a decrease of 65 basis points from fiscal 2014. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was 12.1% and for the year was 13.3%. In the fourth quarter interest and other expense was $236 million, an increase of $138 million from last year. The year-over-year increase reflects two items. First, last year we recorded a $111 million pre-tax gain on the sale of HD Supply common stock that did not repeat this year. And second, interest expense was $29 million higher than last year due primarily to higher long-term debt balances. Our income tax provision rate for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 was 36.4%. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.17, an increase of 11.4% from last year. For the year, diluted earnings per share were $5.46, an increase of 15.9% compared to fiscal 2014. Now moving to some additional highlights, during the fourth quarter we opened one new store in Mexico bringing our total store count at the end of the year to 2,274 stores. At the end of the year, selling square footage was 237 million, up slightly from last year. And sales per square foot increased 5.2% to $371. At the end of the year, inventory was $11.8 billion up $730 million from a year ago. On a currency neutral basis, inventory dollars grew by $872 million. Inventory turns were 4.9 times up from 4.7 times last year. Payables grew $758 million from last year. On a currency neutral basis, payables were up $834 million. Moving on to capital allocation. In 2015 we generated approximately $9.4 billion of cash from operations. And used that cash, as well as proceeds from $4 billion of incremental long-term debt issuances, to invest in our business, to repurchase our shares and pay dividends to our shareholders. During the year, we invested approximately $3.2 billion back into the business through capital expenditures and the acquisition of Interline Brands. Further, we repurchased $7 billion or approximately 59 million of our outstanding shares, including $2 billion or 16.2 million shares in the fourth quarter. Finally, we paid $3 billion in dividends. Our capital allocation philosophy supports our commitment to deliver high returns on invested capital. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 28%, 310 basis points higher than at the end of fiscal 2014. One more comment on capital allocation. Earlier this month, we refinanced approximately $3 billion of our long-term debt that is coming due in March 2016. This morning we issued a press release with our guidance for fiscal 2016. I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP, so fiscal 2016 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2015. As we look to 2016, we are projecting total company comps of approximately 4.5%. Our comp forecast is based on U.S. GDP growth estimates of 2.1% plus continued recovery in the housing market. With the benefits of five new stores and a full year of sales from Interline Brands, we project total sales growth of approximately 6%. Our 2016 sales forecast is based on 2015 average U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates. The U.S. dollar is currently stronger than the average exchange rate. As a result, we are providing a range of sales, comp sales and diluted earnings per share growth to reflect the difference between 2015 average exchange rate and current exchange rates. If currency exchange rates remain where they are today, this would cause a negative impact to fiscal 2016 net sales growth of approximately $800 million, dropping our projected total sales growth rate from 6% to 5.1% and our projected comp sales growth from 4.5% to 3.7%. As we discussed during our December investor conference, we are planning our gross margin rate to remain flat to what we reported in fiscal 2015. We don't expect our gross margin rate to be materially impacted by exchange rates. On a currency-neutral basis, we are forecasting our expenses to grow at approximately 40% of the rate of our sales growth rate less than what we experienced in fiscal 2015 as we had $128 million of net breach-related expenses in fiscal 2015 that should not repeat in 2016. For the year, we project that our operating margin will grow by approximately 70 basis point. We don't expect our operating margin to be materially impacted by exchange rates. For the year, we anticipate our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%. We expect our diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 13% to $6.18, but if exchange rates remain where they are today, our projected diluted earnings per share would be approximately $6.12. Our earnings per share guidance includes our plan to repurchase approximately $5 billion of outstanding shares during the year using excess cash. For the year, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $10 billion. Our 2016 capital spending plan is approximately $1.64 billion, a 9% increase from what we spent in fiscal 2015 in support of our strategic initiatives and to maintain our aging store base. We'll also use our cash to repurchase $5 billion of shares and pay $3.4 billion of dividends. As Craig mentioned, we just announced a 17% increase in our quarterly dividend which equates to an annual dividend of $2.76 in line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50%. Our commitment to shareholder returns continues to be a hallmark of The Home Depot. So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Nicole, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Peter Benedict from Robert W Baird.\nPeter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, first question just an accounting one, I guess. How are you going to deal with the Interline Brands sales as we move through 2016? Once we anniversary that, do those go into the comp base, or are they going to be separate?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Yes, Peter, we're going to put Interline into our comp base. We think it's important to operate as one Home Depot. So as a result, as you think about the shape of the year, the comps in the back half of the year will be higher than the comps in the first half of the year.\nPeter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, perfect. That's helpful. And then the numbers don't seem to suggest you've seen any impact from the wealth affect whether it be the energy markets or the stock market. I mean, obviously everything at big ticket very strong, but as you peel back the information, is there anything you're seeing in terms of consumers may be starting to pull back on any of the higher ticket stuff, again the consolidated numbers don't seem to suggest that? Thank you.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Peter, we're not seeing that. Our business was good and continues to be good.\nPeter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We have Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks, good morning and fantastic quarter.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I'm trying to understand the underlying tenor of demand you mentioned about $100 million lift to comps from weather, looks like about 50 basis points was weather benefit across all three months or was it mainly a November and December impact?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: If we look at our comp performance, we saw double-digit pop in the U.S. in December and that was really weather driven. December was the warmest month on record in 121 years. And Ted, didn't we see a lot of strength in outdoor categories?\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Yes, so clearly both our Pros and consumers were able to continue with outdoor projects. But really we're seeing comp continue to be strong across the entire store. And while we appreciate the $100 million-odd benefit from weather, we don't look at this as a weather story in our fourth quarter.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Goodness no, we grew our sales by $1.8 billion, so $100 million of growth on $1.8 billion is not a weather story.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And it's geography as well, Chris. We saw strength across really all the markets.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Understood. And then do you look at that $100 million as a pull forward, and sticking with the weather, being the first and second quarter tend to be volatile, so how are you thinking about that $100 million, and how are you thinking just how perhaps the spring plays out. I know it's easier to look at on the halves, but as we model out the quarters, how are you thinking about the first versus the second quarter?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Chris, generally you don't see a pull forward from Q4 into Q1 or vice versa. Generally, it plays the bathtub effect between first quarter and second quarter as spring breaks, so we don't believe it's a pull forward.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: As we built our plan, we did build the first quarter as the lowest comping quarter for the year, but that's principally because as we exited the year, as Ted commented, we had commodity deflation in our sales. That commodity deflation continues into the first quarter, so we built the plan to reflect this.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning, nice quarter.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nSimeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: For Craig or Carol and following on this theme, this was I think the second strongest U.S. comp since the housing recovery for Home Depot, and it comes when other things in retail are getting a little shaky. We talked about weather a little bit. But can you give us examples that you can share of any housing markets that may be longer in the tooth of recovery that just continue to chug along?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Actually, the overall variability that we saw in the quarter by market was directly in line with what we saw last year. And you do get a little bit more market variation as you're in winter months based on how winter breaks. So really, there's not a lot of big variability.\nSimeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, so just underlying strength. And then I may have missed this in the prepared remarks. But on Interline, can you share with us how it performed versus expectations, anything on sales or margin? And I realize it's early and I don't think \u2013 a lot of the integration is just getting started, but do you have a sense of how much overlap there is with the Pro, your Pro and spending on Interline Brands maybe outside of the Home Depot today?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We're obviously in the early days of the integration efforts. And we have worked hard across \u2013 as we shared, we have a common vendor base. We're working through the programs with our vendors. We have reduced redundancy in the business, and now we're really getting into more of the focus on the sales side of it and the sales driving initiatives. As we called out, we're excited about the fact that we'll begin to sell our paint brands to the multi-family operators in the Interline company. Bill Lennie is here and he might want to comment. We're starting to see some success in crossover, but it's very early days.\nBill Lennie - Executive Vice President-Outside Sales & Services: No, it is. We have seen some wins on some initial account engagements. And so what that does, it really validates what we see as the value of the Interline acquisition. It's just that synergy about being able to sell across channel. And then as Carol articulated, we're working on that vision of one Home Depot that allows our customers to shop either in store, online, or through Interline, and having greater access to a broader range of goods.\nSimeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, guys. Good morning and congrats on the quarter.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I wanted to just follow up on that last question, but specifically on gross margin. Carol, you're guiding to flat gross margin, which is pretty consistent with everything you've said before. Obviously, Interline has a little bit of a near-term impact on that despite lower SG&A. Once you anniversary the inclusion of Interline, how do you think about the gross margin opportunity from either synergies with Interline or continued supply chain benefits or even lower input costs that some suppliers have talked about? And I guess what do you see as the offset to that? Thanks.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Sure. As Craig mentioned, it's really easier to look at our business by half. So as you think about gross margin for 2016, the first half, because of the impact of Interline, will be down year on year. The back half will be up year on year. The back half will be up year on year because we'll be anniversarying Interline, and we'll see the benefits of productivity. We've talked to you in the past of our ongoing efforts to drive productivity within our cost of goods. We have a cost-out team that we set up several years ago that works directly with Ted and the merchants to drive productivity and first cost, which is our largest cost pool. You've seen us drive incredible productivity in our supply chain. For the year, we had 20 basis points of expansion coming off of supply chain. This productivity that we are driving to our business allows us to invest in lower-margin categories, not only Interline, but lower margin categories like appliances and other categories that haven't fully recovered since the downturn. So we feel very confident of the gross margin guidance that we've given for 2016.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Seth, I'd also \u2013 the comment that I'd make, we shared at the investor conference that our approach is to really look at the end-to-end value chain and drive deeper collaboration with our vendor partners. And as we work through this with key suppliers, as Ted and I talk to them, we're confident, and likewise so are they that there's opportunity to take cost out of the entire value chain, which will benefit not only The Home Depot customer in terms of greater value, the shareholder, but also our vendor partners in terms of driving profitability for them as well.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks for that. That's very helpful, maybe just one follow-up question on Canada, which has come into focus recently. Can you just elaborate on the performance in Canada, and maybe more importantly, how the position of Home Depot has evolved there over time? And how are you thinking about perhaps more capital being deployed there by others in the sector?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We're actually very pleased with our performance in Canada. Before bringing Bill back, he did an amazing job in Canada, and Jeff and the team will continue that effort. We have made significant capital investments in Canada, not only in our stores with the experience that our customers have in store, but also in our website as we've re-platformed our website and continue to develop our interconnected strategy for Canada, as well as a significant investment in our supply chain, deploying our strategy that we developed here in the U.S. into Canada as well. So we're looking forward to continued opportunity to serve our Canadian customers.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: And I might just throw in from a store footprint perspective, we have 182 stores in Canada where we want the stores to be. So we're very pleased with our store footprint.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks so much for the color.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Lasser from UBS.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It seems like one of the biggest surprises in the fourth quarter was the amount of market share that you were able to grab. And that's not even accounting for some of your non-traditional competitors like department stores. That's just your building material flows. So do you have a sense like where it's coming from? Are you seeing capacity come out of this system from some of your traditional competitors and that maybe enabling you to gain share? Or have you altered the way you do business such that these share gains are accelerating?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'd say that certainly it's something that we focus on all the time. The customer is clearly investing in our space, so we're in a good asset class as it relates to housing. But incredibly proud of the team's efforts, whether that is the merchants to be able to deliver incredible values, our stores and our online team to be able to execute against that, our supply chain team that delivered, and the nimbleness of our supply chain to be able to react to kind of both weather patterns that happened during the quarter. Just really, really pleased with the effort that the team put forth in total.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Do you have a sense whether your share gain, and it would seem to suggest based on your commentary about the different business segments, whether your share gains were larger on the Pro side than they were on the consumer side? I'm not including Interline, I'm just talking in the core business.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Right. I mean, what I would say is the measure of share is something that's incredibly difficult to get at overall. We do believe we're taking share in the market, but the finite number, it's pretty tough to get at.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: And it really depends on what you're talking about. Looking at double-digit positive, I suspect that was the Pro customer. In fact, we know it's the Pro customer through our consumer insights. Appliances contributed 50 basis points of our comp growth in the quarter. Most of that is consumer. So you really have to look at the category of business and what was driving each.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: And can you tie those share gains to some of your Pro initiative like the credit initiative, the Pro Xtra initiative and some of what you've done recently? I think it's important just to get a sense for how long these market share gains can last?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Sure. I'll speak to the private label card perhaps.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: We just rolled out our new value prop in January, so you really can't attribute the strength in Pro, which by the way grew faster than the consumer in the fourth quarter. You can't attribute that to private-label card, but we're very excited about what that new private-label card is offering to our Pro customers. As you know 60 days to pay, fuel rewards, 365 day returns, its early days but we are liking what we see, our new accounts are up over our target. Our Pros are enjoying on average $25 off at the pump when they're using their fuel reward card, so we really like what we're seeing and we think that's going to bode well for 2016. So you can't attribute that, but some of the other initiatives that we've introduced are really helping drive the business.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Michael, what I think is happening and we're just very pleased with the performance across all the categories, is we are focused on having the right brands, the right assortments; we've done a lot of work. We've talked about our assortment planning tools, we feel we have the right line structure in the store with right brands in the right price points. We're focused on everyday value and convenience for our Pro and our consumer customers and I think this is resonating.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you so much, good luck.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have a question from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot, and good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Just to follow up on Michael's question, as you think of 2016 and your comp forecast, ex Interline, would you expect the Pro to be a larger driver of your comps in 2016 than 2015?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think we're focused on actually growing all of our segments. We're focused on growing the Pro customer, the DIY customer, the do-it-for-me customer as well as our digital customer. And so we haven't really thought about it as one being radically outsized versus the other. We look at transactions and ticket as a balance of growth as well.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. A follow up. As you think about the composition of traffic and ticket into 2016, you're looking for a balance, what does that dictate in terms of your expectations for the housing market? Do you expect housing prices and turnover to be about in line with 2015 or do you expect any change?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: We actually expect some changes. So let me walk you through those changes if I may. First what I'm going to do is walk you from where we exited in the U.S., a comp of 7.1% to the guidance of 4.5%. That's a 260 basis point delta and the drivers of that are threefold. First it starts with GDP, we're using GDP growth forecast of 2.1%, GDP in the United States in 2015 was 2.4%, so those 30 basis points coming off the top because of slower GDP. Secondly, on home prices, we anticipate home prices to be up next year 3.5%, that's good. It's down from the growth that we experienced in 2015 of 5.4%, so that's another 30 basis points of growth coming off the top. And then there's 200 basis points of market share coming off because we don't feel market share into our growth forecast. So that gives you 4.5% comp estimate for 2016. A few other housing numbers since you asked, I gave you the home price estimate that we're using, we anticipate housing turnover to be up 4.4% of units, household formation to be up considerably, we're forecasting 1.9 million household forms, that's up a lot this year it was about 1.3 million households. The other thing is that we're really spending time trying to get a better understanding is the impact of the age of the housing stock. As you know 65% of the homes in the United States are older than 30 years and there's external research that shows that spending on older homes is higher. John Burns would suggest it's something like 7.5% higher, our own internal research suggests it's 8% higher, so this aging housing stock bodes very well for us. And if we could take you back to the last mild recession, and I'm talking a lot here and I apologize, but if I take you back to the last mild recession of 2001, the housing stock was a lot younger 10 years ago. So this is a good new story for us.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. That is a good new story. And just one last follow up. Obviously, you don't factor in market share gains, but anything execution wise that you think will change that could impact the market share gain trajectory in 2016?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, I mean, we're going to continue to focus on what we've been doing. So, no. I don't see any major change.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you and good luck.\nOperator: And we have a question from Jessica Mace from Nomura Securities.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Good morning and congrats on the good results.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: My first question is about the SG&A guidance. I just wanted to clarify that 40% of sales growth includes the data breach expenses from last year? And if there is anything else we should be factoring in as to why that would be lower than the 50% of sales growth guidance you gave at your analyst day?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: No. I'm confirming that you understand that completely.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: All right, great. Thank you. And then I had a question on the interconnected retail. You showed some good progress in that channel. What are the other near-term milestones we should be looking for in that channel?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We're continuing to clearly roll out the investment we've made in our direct fulfillment centers. So we're continuing to assort those buildings which will give us the capability where we put products across all three buildings to be able to get product to our customers in two business days or less. So you'll see us continue to shrink lead times for our customers. You will continue to see us invest in enhancements through search, visualization as it relates to not only photography, but video for our customers. We know that our customers engage in that. And Kevin Hofmann is here who runs our online business. Kevin, I hope you have additional comments to make to that.\nKevin Hofmann - Senior Vice President & President-Online, The Home Depot, Inc.: Sure. And just to continuing to develop better experiences for our customers. Mobile experiences are a big focus for us as well. And as Craig mentioned, we're also rolling out our buy online, deliver from store functionality through the year. And we think our customers will be excited about that.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: The great news for us is 40% plus of all the orders that happened in our digital space, our customers choose to pick that up in one of our stores. They're conveniently located, they're safe. They know that the product is going to be there, they don't have to worry about it not being on their doorstep. And that's a great opportunity for us as it drives more traffic to our stores.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: And we have a question from Dan Binder from Jefferies.\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: Hi, thank you. My question is regarding online. I was wondering if you could give us the growth rate in the quarter? I think you gave us for the year. And what do you think the top two or three things that are helping the strong conversion there?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Yes. Our online sales grew $230 million or 23% in the quarter. For the year, total online sales were $4.7 billion. That's 5.3% of our total sales up from 4.5% from last years. Really pleased with the growth.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Kevin, do you want to comment?\nKevin Hofmann - Senior Vice President & President-Online, The Home Depot, Inc.: So key things driving the growth is really what we talked about. Great mobile experiences, great end-to-end interconnected experiences. Our focus is not just the transaction online, but as Craig said, over 40% of our orders actually end up in the store in one way, shape or form. So what we found is a lot of our online experiences are really about tying the customer back to the store side shopping journey. And when we look at the total enterprise conversion rate, just very, very pleased with our progress there. Whether they convert online or whether they convert in the store, that's really the customers' decision. So really great progress, we set all new records during our Cyber Monday event and our Black Friday event, and really, really strong momentum.\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: And then my follow up, I was just hoping maybe you could comment on a few things. First, what your commodity deflation assumptions are for Q1? What the breakdown was of the $90 million of extra expense in Q4? And what you may be seeing in wage pressures across the company or regionally?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Happy to. So the commodity price deflation pressure, again, we don't forecast future deflation. So our forecast is inflation, deflation neutral, but because we have seen prices come down that has a year-over-year impact. It's about 50 bps in the first quarter. Looking at the breakdown of expenses. Of the $90 million that were over our plan, about one-third of the dollars were related to store maintenance, snow removal and the data breach, the data breach specifically being $9 million. And then the rest was in our bonus and Success Sharing. As Craig pointed out, all of our stores are eligible for Success Sharing. We're going to have the highest second-half payout in our company history, so we're excited about that. And then, Dan, the third question?\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: It was regarding wage pressure that you may be seeing either regionally or as a company, how it increases and so forth?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Yes, so thank you for that question. As we told you at our investor conference, we do have some people costs coming at us, both in terms of wage pressure as well as higher medical costs due to prescription drugs. All of those pressures have been addressed in the guidance that we have given you.\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And we have a question from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot and good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: My primary question relates to your big-ticket sales trends. That comp growth in tickets of $900 or more, I think, is the second strongest on record on both a one-year and a two-year basis. A couple elements there, you mentioned custom kitchens. I'm just curious whether those megaprojects are gaining more traction. And also, does the Pro growth that you're seeing, and particularly the acceleration in some of the Pro categories doing better, disproportionately impact that big-ticket zone of your sales?\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: I would say, Matt, on big-ticket, we like the progress we're seeing in the momentum. You specifically mentioned the kitchen cabinet business. That was a strong double-digit comp for us. And what's encouraging is the pipeline of quotes in our system are at record highs. And even now after such a strong Q4 going into Q1, we have a very robust pipeline. Just across the whole store, appliances obviously is a big-ticket item that continues to grow. And our service businesses, we have nice traction with our home interiors business and exterior business, whether it's kitchen installs or roofing, siding, windows. So seeing really across the business.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And if it's possible to dissect the acceleration from the 8% growth, really high single digits that you've seen year to date to the 12% number, would you say that either DIY or Pro is disproportionately behind that pickup?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Actually, both.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: The installs, certainly consumer, right?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Appliances, consumer.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Appliances, consumer, roofing has a tendency to be Pro.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you for that.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Matt, the only point on that is as we look at \u2013 we talk about our top classes that still haven't recovered from peak. And we're still, as much as we've recovered in aggregate all of the lost sales, there's still $2.5 billion in key categories. And those tend to be bigger ticket items, so special order kitchens, countertops, and all manner of millwork still remain below the 2006 peak. So we're watching ticket carefully, as Carol said. But from all indications, pipelines are strong and sales continue with good momentum.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then just a couple of cleanup points on the expense line. Carol, you spoke about the impact of Interline on gross margin rate. Can you talk to the impact, if any, on the expense ratio? And then the D&A guidance does suggest a bit of a pickup. Is that primarily related to the deal, or is there something else within that number?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: The D&A pickup is related to shorter-life assets being put into service. We're investing into IT in a big way, and that capital tends to have a shorter life. And the impact of Interline is really reflected in the overall expense growth factor for the quarter. We were around 52%-ish. That's really because of Interline. If you back out Interline, it was more like 40%.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you so much.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Yes.\nOperator: And we have a question from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning, guys.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So a bigger question, I guess two questions technically, on e-commerce. We've obviously seen e-commerce disrupt so many retail sectors. So I guess the two questions are number one, how do you think about the risk of consumers potentially getting increasingly used to shopping for your category, especially with the growth of your own platform online? And then two, in your opinion, what makes home improvement different than what we've seen in so many other retail sectors where the box guys tend to battle market share losses and margin compression over time? Why would you be immune to that in your opinion?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think when you look at the business in total, there's a combination of factors. There are segments of our business \u2013 we've shared in the past that we believe the best business model is in the store. And the customers, they're smart, they have a tendency to gravitate to the best business models. And so we think there are elements of things like concrete and soils and mulches that make sense, and that's where the customer will find the best value to purchase the product. There are other categories that are enhanced by the digital experience. As Kevin was just sharing a minute ago, where our customers actually start their shopping experience online, but then finish in store. And then there are clearly categories that are, if you will, at risk to transfer online because whether it's breadth of assortment or ease of shipping. And candidly in those categories to date, for the most part we actually see growth in both channels. And so the digital business in large part has been incremental growth for us, and we see that opportunity to continue.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC: But do you think there's a risk that as people get more used to shopping at some of those categories that you're terming at risk that you can wind up seeing increased margin compression down the road because obviously that's something we've seen in a lot of other retail segments?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We run this as one business as a portfolio. We've built out the capabilities in the tools to give visibility to our merchants to manage this across channels. So it's all built into our forward look that we shared at our investor conference.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got you, all right. Thanks, guys.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kate McShane from Citi.\nKate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thank you. Good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nKate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): My question is on Project Sync. I know that was a big focus of your analyst day and you had mentioned in the prepared comments that it's been rolled out beyond Houston. Can you give us any more detail about where else this has been rolled out to and can you remind us when you see this being completed?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It is in the process of rolling out in additional southern areas of the country and this is a multiyear effort.\nKate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, thank you. And then my follow-up question was just on exclusivity of product. Again, in the prepared comments I think you said that was a differentiator for the Pro, do you have a percentage of what you're offering or sales percentages is of exclusive products to the Pro customer?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Honestly, we haven't calculated that. We talk about our private brands in the 15% to 20% range, but not yet talked about the exclusive products\nKate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, thank you.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: We'll go back do the calculations. I don't know what it is.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.\nDiane Dayhoff - Vice President-Investor Relations: Nicole, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We will take our final question then from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.\nGregory Melich - Evercore ISI: Great, thanks. I have two parts to it just to sneak one in. Carol, I just want to make sure I got the SG&A thing right in the guidance. If it's 40% of sales growth we should be taking 40% of 5.5% when we think about SG&A dollar growth, is that right?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: So you should be taking 40% of the sales growth we gave which is 6%.\nGregory Melich - Evercore ISI: Okay. And then the second question is, on working capital. So I hate to end on this, but try to find something wrong with these numbers, inventory was up a lot but payables were up too, what do you have in your $10 billion of cash flow guidance for working capital on 2016? And do you feel good about inventories where they are? Are they too hot, too cold, just right?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: So our inventories are in the best shape we've seen and I've been here, this is my 21st year, so I can speak from authority, they're in really great shape. We have one-tenth improvement in inventory plan for 2016 and Mark Holifield is here and I would say we might want to try to get even better than that, but that's the plan.\nMark Holifield - Executive VP-Supply Chain & Product Development: Just one thing, just color on inventory, one thing to keep in mind is last year we had the West Coast port disruption which led to artificially lower inventory, so we're actually very pleased with where our inventory is and on top of that, we're very, very pleased with where our in-stock is compared to last year which we're really seeing a material improvement in-stock versus last year because we're overlapping those port disruptions from last year.\nGregory Melich - Evercore ISI: Great. So it's fair to say the $10 billion of cash from operations might include a couple hundred million from working capital, but there's no massive move either way?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: That's correct.\nGregory Melich - Evercore ISI: Okay, great, good luck.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Thank you.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you for joining us on our call today, and we look forward to reporting our first quarter earnings at the end of May when we'll talk to you then.\nOperator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

[Operator instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you, Allan, and good morning to everyone. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear, Chairman, CEO and President; Ted Decker, EVP of Merchandising; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions.

If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Now, before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $21.8 billion, up 6.4% from last year. Comp sales were 5.1% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.3%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.35 in the third quarter. In the third quarter, as we saw in the second quarter, we had a broad-based growth across our geographies. All three of our US divisions recorded mid to high-single digit comps. Every region posted positive comps in the quarter as did all of our top 40 markets.  Year-over-year, the variability in performance across our regions has narrowed considerably. On the international front, our Canadian business posted positive comps in local currency, making it 16 consecutive quarters of positive comps. In addition, our Mexican business had another quarter of solid performance, with positive double digit comps in local currency. This makes 48 quarters in a row or 12 years of positive comp growth for our Mexican business.  We saw growth in ticket transactions and average basket size in the third quarter and we were particularly pleased with the strong transaction growth, as each month in the quarter had positive comp transactions. We view our growth in transactions as a positive sign of our continued relevance with our customers. As Ted will detail, we continue to see strength across our store. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps and we saw healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories. Our Pro business continues to be driven by a strong offering of brands that pros demand, consistent product innovation, as well as services that help them increase their business.  During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Interline Brands, a leading national distributor of Maintenance, Repair and Operations or MRO products. This acquisition builds in our existing capabilities to serve our Pro customers. Interline gives us a national presence in the MRO market, which will allow us to expand our share of wallet with our collective customers. We are diligently working our integration plans and are excited about the opportunities that we see ahead.  The retail environment has been and is changing. Our customers, both Pro and DIY, are changing the way they shop for our products and services. Our goal is to provide our customers with the convenient and fulfillment options they require. Whether they buy products online through a personal computer, a tablet or their mobile phone, we\u2019re enabling them to pick up product in our stores or have products shipped to their home. We're investing in making the process easier and frictionless.  We continue to see healthy sales from our digital business. Online sales grew proximately 25% in the third quarter and represent approximately 5.1% of overall sales. About 42% of all online orders are picked up in our conveniently located stores. We rolled out Mexico's digital commerce site during the first half of the year. Although, we're just getting started, we're seeing great results. In Canada, we re-platformed our website which went live earlier this month. Back in the US, we opened our third online customer contact center in Tempe, Arizona. All this is a further sign of our commitment to interconnected retail in our geographies.  We continue to focus and invest in our supply chain to drive productivity and to deliver a better customer experience. As our customers are transacting more frequently through our online channels, we have invested in creating the right fulfillment options to support that growing business. During the third quarter, we opened and began shipping from our third new direct fulfilment center in Troy Township, Ohio. With these three direct fulfillment centers, we now have the capability to reach 90% of our US customers in two business days or less with parcel shipping.  As you know, we\u2019ve been piloting our new order alignment system, which we call COM, as well as buy online deliver from store or BOPIS. We're really pleased with the results of the COM pilot and we\u2019ve laid out a roll out plan for 2016. The BOPIS roll out will follow COM. In the 108 stores where we have BOPIS, our on-time delivery service is now exceeding our target. BOPIS will also be rolled out in 2016.  Turning to the macro environment, while 2015 consensus US GDP growth projections have moderated, we continue to see positive signs in the housing data, with home price appreciation and housing turnover being key drivers of growth for our business. As Carol will detail, we are guiding our fiscal 2015 sales to grow by approximately 5.7% with comps of approximately 4.9%. This is after the effects of a stronger US dollar. Year to date, due to a stronger US dollar, our sales growth has been negatively impacted by over $1 billion. We believe that the US dollar will remain strong through the fourth quarter. We\u2019re guiding fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share to be $5.36, an increase of approximately 14% versus fiscal 2014.  Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work, dedication and commitment to our customers. Based on this quarter's results, 99% of our stores will be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates.  With that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks Craig and good morning everyone. We were pleased with our performance in the third quarter as sales exceeded expectations. We saw strength across the store as well as continued growth in our online business. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. Appliances, Tools, plumbing, decor, lighting, hardware, building materials, and indoor garden were above the company average. Outdoor garden, kitchen and bath, electrical, millwork, flooring, lumber and paint were positive, but below the company average. Pro heavy categories continued to show great strength and we saw double digit comps in power tools, commercial lighting, HVAC, fencing and power tool accessories.  Additionally, flooring tools and materials, siding concrete fasteners, roofing, builders\u2019 hardware and compressors, had comps above the company average. The core of the store continued to perform well across the country as we saw strength in maintenance and repair categories. Watering, water heaters, ceiling fans, air circulation, hand tools and generators, all had double digit comps in the quarter. Wet drive VACs, wiring devices, pipe and fittings and ladders had comps above the company average. There was also strength in the core projects, with comps above company average in special order window coverings, vanities, in-stock kitchen and fixtures.  Our Halloween and Harvest and Labor Day events provided great values and were well received by our customers, resulting in double digit comps in decorative holiday organization and appliances. Sales of grills, soils and mulches, pressure washers and cleaning, had comps above the company average. Using our assortment planning tools, our merchandising team constantly refines our assortments by bringing science to the art of merchandising. Recently, we leveraged these tools to better understand the customer preferences in roofing. We updated our roofing clusters to tailor our roofing brands to specific markets and customers and we introduced more high definition laminates shingles. This process yielded great results in the third quarter. By providing the Pro customer the right brand, assortment and value, we drove double digit comps in shingles.  Total comp transactions grew by 4.3%, while comp ticket increased 0.9% for the quarter. Our average ticket growth is a bit distorted due to the stronger US dollar. In the US, our average ticket was up 2.6%. Finally, commodity price deflation in certain products such as lumber, negatively impacted our average ticket increase by about 40 basis points. While lumber prices are down, we were very pleased with unit growth. Transactions for tickets under $50 representing approximately 20% of our US sales, were up 3.6% for the third quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our US sales, were up 7.8% in the third quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were appliances, roofing and countertops.  Now, let me turn our attention to the fourth quarter. We recently introduced the new Husky 100 platform of mechanics tools for our DIY and Pro customers. This new platform was designed with speed and access in mind. These tools feature a 100 position gear system that allows the tools to work in tight areas where normal mechanics tools cannot perform. This new family of tools is exclusive to The Home Depot and offers is a lifetime guarantee. In the fourth quarter, we were also pleased to introduce six new models of NuTone InVent bath and ventilation fans for our Pro customers. This easy to install fans have new features that allow for room side installation with no attic access required. Easy installation saves our Pro customers valuable time.  We have an outstanding offering of product in our gift centers for the holiday season and our best line yet in holiday d\u00e9cor. Our gift centers will feature an extensive assortment of hand and power tools, including amazing values from the Milwaukee, Makita, DeWalt, Ryobi, Rigid and Diablo. The gift centers will also feature an impressive lineup of tools and storage boxes from Husky. In holiday d\u00e9cor, we have become a leading destination in the category, both in-store into our expanded assortment online. We continue to focus on bringing innovative and exciting offers to our customers throughout the holiday season. We\u2019re excited about our lineup of pre-lit lead and holiday lights. For Black Friday, we have fantastic special buys with extreme values for the traditional DIY customer and our Professional customer, including some amazing offers on appliance suites. With all of these exciting products, events and great in-store execution, we look forward to driving a strong holiday season.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol Tom\u00e9 : Thank you, Ted, and hello everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that this is the first quarter where we are including Interline Brands in our financial results. While the acquisition closed in late August, our third quarter results include one month of Interline, as we are accounting for Interline one month in arrear. Finally, while Interline results are included in our consolidated financial statements, they are not yet included in certain operating metrics like comp sales, sales per square foot, average ticket or transaction.  With that, in the third quarter, sales were $21.8 billion, a 6.4% increase from last year. Versus last year, a stronger US dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $413 million or 2%. Our total company comp store same store sales were positive 5.1% for the quarter, with positive comps of 2.6% in August, 7.6% in September and 5.2% in October. Comps for US stores were positive 7.3 % for the quarter, with positive comps of 4.6 % in August, 10.1% in September and 7.1% in October. Our monthly comp sales were a bit distorted by the timing of Labor Day this year versus last year. In the US, if you assume Labor Day fell in the same fiscal month as last year, our comps were 6.9% in August, 7.8% in September and 7.1% in October.  Our total company gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 34 basis points from last year. Our gross margin expansion is explained by the following. First, we had 24 basis points of gross margin expansion as we reached a certain higher co-op and rebate tiers and recognize that benefit in our cost of goods sold. Second, we had 15 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, due primarily to lower fuel costs and a higher penetration of product going through our RDC network. Third, we had 5 basis points of gross margin expansion from lower shrink. These three items drove gross margin expansion of 44 basis points, offset by 10 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. For fiscal 2015, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2014. In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 88 basis points to 21%. Total operating expenses were approximately $14 million higher than our plan, driven by expenses related to our data breach. In the third quarter, we incurred $20 million of legal and litigation related expenses in connection with our data breach. In the third quarter, our expenses grew at approximately 33% of the rate of our sales growth, reflecting solid expense control and self-leverage. For the year, we expect our expenses to grow at approximately 47% of our sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter and for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 was 13.7%. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $240 million, up $127 million from last year. The year over year change reflects two items. First, interest and investment income decreased by $98 million as we left last year\u2019s $100 million gain on sale of HD Supply common stock. Second, interest expense increased by $29 million from last year due primarily to higher long term debt balances.  In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 37.1% and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 36.5% for the year.  Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.35, an increase of 17.4% from last year. The strength of the US dollar negatively impacted earnings per share growth by about $0.03 on the quarter.  During the third quarter, we opened 3 new stores in Mexico for an ending store count of 2,273. Total sales per square foot for the third quarter were $366, up 5.3% from last tear.  Now, turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $12.5 billion, up $487 million from last year. On a currency neutral basis, inventory dollars grew by $721 million dollars, of which approximately $324 million was the result of the Interline acquisition. Inventory turns were 5 times compared to 4.8 times last year. Payables were up $339 million from last year. On a currency neutral basis, payables were up $466 million, including $134 million of Interline payables.  Moving to our share repurchase program, in the third quarter we received 1.3 million shares related to the true-up of an Accelerated Share Repurchase or ASR program we initiated in the second quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter we repurchased approximately $2 billion or 15.1 million of outstanding shares. This included 5 million shares we purchased in the open market and 10.1 million shares we purchased through an ASR program. For the shares we purchased under the third quarter ASR program, this is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon completion of the ASR in the fourth quarter. For the reminder of the year, we intend to repurchase approximately $2 billion of outstanding stock for total fiscal 2015 share repurchases of approximately $7 billion.  During the quarter we raised $1.5 billion of senior notes to finance the Interline acquisition. We now have $20.9 billion of long term debt, of which $3 billion comes due on March 1, 2016. We plan to refinance that debt prior to it coming due.  Computed on the average of beginning and ending long term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 26.2%, 400 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2014.  Now moving to our guidance, because we are 9 months through the year and because we don\u2019t think the US dollar is going to weaken, we are providing a point estimate for our comp sales and diluted earnings per share growth guidance. We now believe that fiscal 2015 sales will grow by approximately 5.7% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Our sales and earnings per share growth guidance is higher than the low end of our previous guidance as it includes our third quarter out-performance and continued momentum in the US. Our guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates remain at current levels through the fourth quarter.  We estimate a stronger US dollar will impact out total sales growth for the year by approximately $1.4 billion. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. For fiscal 2015 we project our diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 14% to $5.36. This earnings per share guidance assumed foreign exchange rates remain at current levels through the fourth quarter and includes our attempt to repurchase approximately $2 billion in additional shares in the quarter.  We look forward to talking with you at our investor conference on December 8, where we will update you on key strategic initiatives and lay out our new three financial targets.  We thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call and Allan we\u2019re now ready for questions.\nOperator:  [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning. Nice quarter. First question on the gross margin drivers I guess for Carol or Craig, can you talk about the sustainability of some of the -- I don\u2019t know if they are one-time items, the supply chain piece could be more sustainable, some of the lower acquisition costs. I don\u2019t know if it that\u2019s one time or there should be some recurring element to them.\nCarol Tome: We are very pleased with our gross margin performance in the quarter starting with the benefits that we saw from co-op and rebate. This was effectively reaching higher purchasing turns here in certain categories like roofing. And as Ted described, we just had an outstanding roofing business. So we look into the fourth quarter, roofing can be impacted by weather of course, but we would envision that that performance would continue. Supply chain, we would expect to have continuing benefits from our supply chain as our RDC network continues to mature. I will say however, as you\u2019re building your models for the fourth quarter, we do expect year on year for our gross margin to be down. Why? Because we will be selling a lot of lower margin goods as Ted described in his remarks.\nSimeon Gutman: Got it. Okay. And then one follow up on expenses. The business did a great job once again and you held the line despite some of the increased volumes. Can you talk about how much the economic model that exists in stores versus things that are behind the scene that we don\u2019t see like some corporate or indirect savings that you continue to realize?\nCarol Tome: Thank you. We were pleased with our expense leverage in the third quarter. Marc Powers and his team do an awesome job of making sure that our stores are staffed to meet the needs of our customers. Our voice of customer results have never been higher, while also driving productivity within the hourly sales force. Hourly payroll leveraged 41 basis points in the quarter, but it\u2019s more than just payroll. Marc again and his team have invested in new technology to lower the cost of heating and cooling our stores. Utilities were down year on year and drove 6 basis points of benefit in the quarter. While we had breach expense in the quarter, we had $8 million less breach expense this year than last year, so that was another driver of expense. For us productivity is a virtuous cycle and we see that in the third quarter results\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick follow up on the gross margin. The other piece on the fourth quarter because of Interline will be a 30 basis point headwind versus the 10 in the third quarter?\nCarol Tome: Yes. Thank you for mentioning that. We will have three months of operations of Interline in the third quarter. The Interline gross margin, as you probably have seen by looking at their public financial information, their gross margin is lower than ours, so that will be an impact year on year performance. I will also comment however that Interline\u2019s operating expenses as a percent of sales are lower than ours so we won\u2019t have an expense pressure from Interline in the fourth quarter.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then on the -- Craig, you mentioned a comment about the narrowing of the performance gap across geographies. Some thoughts on what you\u2019re seeing there, what geographies I guess are catching up to the average. Any comments on the Houston market and any other commentary you want to add there would be great. Thanks.\nCraig Menear: Yeah. Let me -- I\u2019ll start with Texas. We have roughly 178 stores in Texas. We look at all the major markets in Texas and they actually preformed above the company average in total. The narrowing of variability by markets, it was roughly, the spread was roughly 6.5% in 2015 compared to 10.4% in 2014. So we\u2019re very, very pleased as we work to continue to focus on high and narrow variability and drive performance up across the geographies.\nChristopher Horvers: Okay. Then I guess a question on everybody\u2019s fear topic which is weather. How should we think about El Nino and how it could impact your business during the next couple of quarters? Does it pull forward demand into 4Q? I think I recall in 1Q 2012 people could do roofs in the Northeast in January because it was so warm, but on the other end you have a big home heating and snow removal exposure in 4Q. How do you think it plays out? Does it neutralize? Does it pull forward and so forth?\nCraig Menear: It really depends on obviously how this plays out. It could potentially play to a warmer northern, which means we might have a year where we have more outdoor project business running deeper into the season. The potential offset to that is a much cooler, wetter southern situation. It really depends on how this plays. We\u2019ll be in position as we always are to try to make sure we take advantage of whatever categories will be the drivers in the different geographies and then with any luck it brings rain to California, which is desperately needed.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse\nQ \u2013 Seth Sigman: Thanks. Hey guys, good morning. Just to follow up on the gross margin outlook. You discussed a mixed impact in the Interline impact. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the promotional activity that you\u2019re seeing in the industry and whether there\u2019s any meaningful change heading into the holiday in some of the more relevant categories like appliances.\nA \u2013 Ted Decker: This is Ted. We\u2019re essentially the same year over year in our promotional cadence. So there won\u2019t be a net impact from promotions.\nQ \u2013 Seth Sigman: Okay, thanks. And then as you look at the Pro side of the business, very strong trend there. Wondering if you could update us on the $6,600 average Pro spend that you\u2019ve seen historically. Obviously that captures a wide spectrum with some customers spending a lot more. When you guys dig into the data, where are you seeing the growth? Is it from existing expenders within that or is it just broad based across the group?\nCraig Menear: We haven\u2019t seen a meaningful change in the total average customer spend. We are seeing that growth come from our larger Pro customers and we\u2019ve seen that trend for the past several quarters now.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: If we look at our managed accounts and those would be large spend Pros, they grew faster than the capital average in the third quarter.\nQ \u2013 Seth Sigman: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Dan Binder with Jefferies\nDan Binder: Good morning. Thanks. Ted, I was hoping maybe you could just maybe talk a little bit more about your initiatives on merchandizing by store. You\u2018ve given us some examples in the past. I think water heaters this quarter. You talked about roofing. Can you give us a little bit of color on where we are, if it was a nine-inning game? Are we still in the early innings or middle innings?\nA \u2013 Ted Decker: I would say it\u2019s always hard to put it in the innings. I would say our tools are maturing nicely. Those are mid innings for sure and then the merchants utilization and the whole change management and speed of how we review categories and ultimately get the refreshed product set in the store, is our new focus area and we\u2019re aiming to increase the speed of transitions of product in the store and that\u2019s in earlier innings, but in terms of the tools, we\u2019re getting pretty well developed there.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Dan, at our investor conference in early December, Ted will go into more detail here. \nDan Binder: Okay. Carol, I don\u2019t think anybody asked yet, but just relative to your fourth quarter plan, how are you feeling about things today? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: There\u2019s a lot of momentum in the US.\nDan Binder: Okay. Do you think weather had helped you at all just in the third quarter?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. Weather is a -- as we talked earlier, weather is a factor in our business, whether it is in a particular category. Clearly with normal weather, you\u2019re not selling a lot of the winter categories right now, but time will come on that. And so you do get an advantage in outdoor projects when the weather stays better.\nDan Binder: Great. Good job. Thanks.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer \nBrian Nagel: Good morning. Congratulations on a very nice quarter. The question I had and I guess it\u2019s mostly for Carol, Ted maybe too. We talked about before. There\u2019s an update given to a lot of the headlines we\u2019ve seen about the retailers in data in general, but what you\u2019re seeing with respect to wages and maybe some pressure, any potential pressures upon The Home Depot model from higher wages in your system?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We, like every other company, are looking at what\u2019s happening with the wage market. In parts of the country where there\u2019s high employment and there\u2019s wage pressure, we adjust, but we are able to work through to through the great productivity model that we have in our stores.\nCraig Menear: We\u2019ll continue to adjust market by market as we see the dynamics of each market unfold.\nBrian Nagel: Okay, that's very helpful. Then any -- I know it's early and I'm sure you'll discuss this more, a lot more at your December meeting, but any initial thoughts on Interline? Now that the transaction has closed, any initial findings or thinking about how this is going to melt into the Home Depot model?\nCraig Menear: We\u2019re in the very early stages of integration and we\u2019re working through that. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity. We know that there is an overlap with our vendor community and we will get synergies from that and are beginning to get synergies already. We also know that we\u2019ve taken our first actions on a little bit of the reorganization of folks where we have duplicate efforts that we don\u2019t need going forward. We\u2019re in the early stages, but we\u2019re excited about the opportunities that we see.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: If I could just add a comment from the macro perspective, you saw household formation up 1 point billion households formed in the third quarter, many of those households moving into multi-family units. The Interline acquisitions gives us a great selling vehicle to serve that new household if you will.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. Thank you and congrats again.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Aram Rubinson with Wolfe research.\nAram Rubinson: Hey everybody, good morning. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Your Company has gone through a history of acquisitions where the pendulum has swung one way and then the other. You were doing a whole lot of acquisitions in the early 2000s and then of course you just kind of shut it down. Now you're swinging back the other way. I'm trying to figure out where that pendulum feels comfortable organizationally. Is it halfway in between where you had been or are you preferring to stay towards the conservative side?\nCraig Menear: No. What we\u2019ve said Aram is that we will look at acquisitions where it gives us the ability to gain capabilities that we might want to go build ourselves. And so if you think about some of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done, the BlackLocus acquisition gave us a data science capability that\u2019s being leveraged by our merchants for assortment and price. If you think about the Crown Bolt acquisition, that was basically a company that was built for us that we sold when we sold HD Supply. We got it back. That gives us different distribution capabilities for small packaged goods in our stores. The Interline acquisition gives us the capability to better serve our pro customer through things like open account, through 93 points of distribution where we can deliver same day, next day. This is all about how do we actually get capabilities. Beyond that, really not looking for acquisitions. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Right. So you might think well, do you need to buy marketplace? No, we can build that. Do you need to buy a services company? No, we have one. Those are capabilities that we don\u2019t need to acquire.\nAram Rubinson: Thanks. And then just follow up, I know that in order to prepare for the future, you've migrated some categories out of the store, the margin patios, grills, etc., figuring you can sell that online and devote other space to some other new categories. Where does appliances fit into that mix in terms of migrating them out of the store versus in the store?\nCraig Menear: I would say on that, we already have a model that leverages a nice interconnected complement of displaying the product in the store, but then delivering direct from our manufacturers\u2019 warehouses. We\u2019re leveraging an interconnected model from the day we developed our appliance model.\nAram Rubinson: Okay. Already showrooming then. Thank you and good luck this quarter.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Jaime Katz from Morningstar.\nJaime Katz: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious if you guys could comment on capital allocation policy. Outside of share repurchases, what other opportunities you guys are seeing to deploy capital and maybe to focus on either a product or merchandising innovation in light of the fact that shares have run up pretty robustly over the last few years?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We have a disciplined and balanced approach when it comes to capital allocation. The first use of cash is to invest it back in the business. This year we\u2019ll spend about $1.6 billion in capital back in the business supporting our growth. We then take our excess cash and first pay 50% of our earnings in a dividend and the way that works is at the end of the year, we\u2019ll look at how much we\u2019ve earned and we will cut it in half and that will be the new dividend. If there weren\u2019t ever to be an earnings disruption, we wouldn\u2019t cut the dividend. We would just earn back into that 50% payout and then excess cash is used to repurchase shares.  We think that\u2019s the best use of excess cash rather than leaving it on the balance sheet, which would be value diluting to our shareholders. We do have an adjusted debt to EBITDA target of two times. We\u2019re at that ratio right now. We have used the financial leverage judiciously both to support acquisitions as well as to buy back our shares. As it relates to evaluation of our share price, we do have a point of view. We\u2019re not at that intrinsic value, so as we continue to outperform, that intrinsic value continues to increase.\nJaime Katz: Okay. And then I think you made some additional commentary on spend for the data breach. Do you guys see those expenses wrapping up over the next quarter or two or is it sort of to be determined?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: There are ongoing legal fees as well as litigation activities. We\u2019ve estimated another $5 million of expense in the fourth quarter, but there could be more. None of that would be bigger than a bread box. It\u2019s all manageable. The biggest numbers that we had for the numbers that we settled on with the payment card networks in the second quarter.\nJaime Katz: Thank you very much.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Bigger than a bread box is not a financial term, but you know what I mean.\nOperator: Now we\u2019ll go to Seth Basham with Wedbush securities. \nSeth Basham: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. My first question is around the consumers' behavior in the store in terms of trading up. Are seeing more activity of consumers trading up to premium products?\nCraig Menear : I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s any more dramatic than we\u2019ve talked about before, but we do look at sales by price point and again this quarter we had a progression of higher comps as you went up price points in an assortment.\nSeth Basham : Got it. That's helpful color. As it relates to the Pro, can you give us a sense of how much better the Pro is comping relative to the DIY customer and whether or not that gap has increased or decreased over the last few quarters?\nCraig Menear : Our large spend Pro, as Carol mentioned earlier is actually comping above the company average and that\u2019s been a driver certainly in our Pro recovery. That hasn\u2019t changed dramatically in the last few quarters. It\u2019s been pretty consistent.\nSeth Basham: Got it. You look forward, when you think about all the services and brands you're offering to the Pro and the macro environment, do you think that type of gap can persist or would you expect it to increase?\nCraig Menear : We would certainly expect it to continue.\nSeth Basham: Got it. Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Moving on, we\u2019ll go to Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Baker: Hi, thanks guys. A couple of questions. One, the industry data that a lot of us look at, the NAICS data has been a very reliable indicator for your comps historically, although the last couple of quarters you guys have far outpaced that data at really an accelerating pace. Do you see that as taking incremental market share and if so where do you think you're taking it from?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: If I could just jump in the market share. The census data, the NAICS score for one would suggest that we have grown market share.\nCraig Menear : Correct and again we compete with a lot of folks across each of our product categories and it varies widely by product category. Whether that\u2019s other big box, whether it\u2019s wholesale distributors, whether it\u2019s digital competitors. So we are very focused category by category as to where are the largest opportunities to grow our business and take share.\nA \u2013 Ted Decker : That share on a rolling 12 through September was 56 basis points up.\nMike Baker: Got it. Understood. One more question I wanted to ask, just on the really strong comp last year, could you remind us if weather did play an impact on that? What I'm getting at is a really harsh winter up here in the Northeast, how much did that help or perhaps hurt the comp last year and how should we think about that as we cycle against it? For instance roofing, everyone I know up here in Boston had a leak in the roof. I assume your roofing business is still being helped by what happened last winter.\nCraig Menear : Sure and I think that\u2019s the key is, is that based on the weather and we did have impacts from weather last year, it then impacts categories differently from a timing standpoint. As you mentioned, tough winter last year in the northeast. Certainly, as you get into the spring, you see people making repairs on things like roofing and in some cases, a lot of live goods needed to be repaired as well, but then that obviously is offset by categories. If it's a warm winter, nobody is doing -- you're doing outside projects and nobody was doing that last year. Those are the dynamics category by category that affect our business particularly as it relates to start of spring and then through the tail end of the winter season.\nCarol Tom\u00e9:  The good thing is that over time weather normalizes and if you look at our US comp on a two year stack basis, we\u2019ve seen acceleration from Q1 to Q2, Q2 to Q3 and now with the guidance that we\u2019ve just given you, that\u2019s acceleration into Q4 as well.\nMike Baker: Understood. Okay. Yeah, we all learned the term ice dam and roof rake up here in New England last year.\nCraig Menear : It was a tough winter.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It was just winter\nMike Baker: Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler: Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question relates to big-ticket projects, which continue at a very nice clip. Anything in the business that gives you leading indicators as to project-oriented business, whether it's people looking for bids, taking samples, etc. on some of the more project-oriented categories? \nCraig Menear : I think as Ted mentioned, while we had pressure from deflation in lumber, we're very pleased with our unit productivity and pleased with what we saw in our Pro business. As we said, the larger spend Pro is leading the pace there and above the company average. That clearly, those lean to bigger ticket projects, the building materials business, bigger ticket projects. We\u2019re very encouraged by that spend with the customer. And then likewise, you look at categories like appliances, that's a big ticket spend as well. So we don't really see a slowdown if you will in big ticket. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Matt, if I can add from a macro perspective, as we look at home equity lines of credit, you know they're down 29% from the peak, but 17 million home equity lines have been planted this year and 28% of the banks who are underwriting those lines of credit are stating that their underwriting is starting to ease a bit. But think about how people use their home equity lines. It typically goes into a bigger project, like a kitchen remodel or that sort of thing. It's a bit encouraging as we think about Q4 and beyond. \nMatthew Fassler: Thank you. And then a quick follow-up. Craig, you spoke earlier about the reality that retail is changing. Consumers are shopping differently and your online business continues to grow nicely, though still only 5% of the mix. How do you guys think about the long run operating margin implications of this? You think about the amazing flow-through you've had, the very modest expense growth relative to sales, I know that this will move pretty slowly for you just because of the roll in the business, even as it grows rapidly. I'm not sure if it's possible to think about the incremental margin on a transaction delivered versus picked up in the store or shopped without any e-commerce intervention. But as you look out the next two or three years, you might tackle this a bit in early December, how do you think about the role of Omni-channel in impacting your financial model?\nCraig Menear : The way we look at it quite candidly is as one business and an interconnected approach. A couple of things. One, we shared with you that we did what we called cog A, so we looked at normalizing how we account for things in both channels so that our merchants have a common view of all costs and expenses. And then as I mentioned earlier, 42% of our online orders are picked up in our stores. It's very much a blended mix and we look at it as a blended mix. And so we see it more of the same going forward. We\u2019ll probably, will provide a little bit more outlook as we go into our December investor conference in terms of how the business is coming together by channel, but certainly view it as one Home Depot for the customer. \nMatthew Fassler: Thank you.\nOperator: Now we go to Kate McShane with Citi. Ms. McShane, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKate McShane: Good morning. I was wondering if I could follow up on the e-commerce questions, with the opening of the third fulfillment center, how do you view the actual store as a fulfillment center? And are you looking to use anything like Instacard or Google Express as a way to further your Omni-channel experience?\nCraig Menear: I\u2019d just say that we do a lot of deliveries from store today, but Mark Holifield is here. I\u2019ll let him comment on this.\nMark Holifield: Our stores have been a base for delivery for quite some time where we take orders in the store and deliver them. This buy online deliver from store initiative that we have rolling in 180 stores now and we\u2019ll roll out in 2016 allows us to take orders online, drop them to the store and use those same delivery assets to get to our customers. We continue to stay abreast of the various offerings in the marketplace. We think the most important thing for us to focus on right now is our deliver from store initiative, utilizing the assets that we have in place now.\nKate McShane: Okay. And if I can just follow up on that question. Have you seen any meaningful change in the consumer behavior with regards to again mobile shopping or shopping through the website sequentially, so a meaningful change from Q2 into Q3?\nCraig Menear: No, not really. We\u2019ve grown pretty comfortably quarter to quarter.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. We've seen the spread between your same-store sales in the category expand for a couple of quarters now. So can you tie your share gains to specific categories that you've invested in? Or do you think it's coming from the expense of just some competitors who are experiencing turbulence as a result of self-inflicted wounds? Or alternatively could we just be at the point in the cycle where the incremental consumer who's coming into the home improvement market is more compelled to go to the big-box on center channel?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Do you want to start, Ted or?\nTed Decker: Yeah. I would start on the investment piece first. Absolutely we see terrific productivity in the areas that we have invested and from what we can track. We believe we\u2019re taking share in these areas and I\u2019d highlight three. One would be with lithium ion battery technology in power tools and now migrating to outdoor power. We have an extremely robust lineup of brands and product and values in power tools and believe we\u2019re taking meaningful share there. LED in light bulbs and now increasingly integrated into light fixtures where we\u2019ve been very aggressive following the development of that technology.  We\u2019ve partnered with some of the best folks in the industry in our light bulb and now again integrated fixtures with LED are very strong and we believe we\u2019re taking share. Then in appliances certainly. We\u2019ve been expanding square footage for some time now, investing into floor space and adding some additional brands to our portfolio there. We saw double digit comps in appliances yet again this quarter and believe we\u2019re taking share in appliances.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: To your question about where are we on the cycle. We\u2019re doing a lot of work in this regard, trying to come up with our own point of view. One thing we learned looking at data coming out of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies as well as John Burns Real Estate Advising Firm, is that homes that are older than 45 years tend to be, have higher repairs. And in fact, the amount of money spent on repairs on those older homes is 5.6% higher than the amount of money paid to repair a home that\u2019s about 20, 24 years old. There are 40 million homes in the United States that are older than 40 years. As the housing stock ages, it just bodes very well for big-box home improvement retailers to sell to those customers who need to make repairs in their homes.\nMichael Lasser: Carol, do you have any insight into whether someone who lives in an older home would have a greater propensity to go to a big-box store versus some other retailer like a specialty player?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Don\u2019t have that kind of insight, but we\u2019ll continue to study.\nCraig Menear: What I would say on that is the merchants will continue to focus on products that make it easier for our pros as well as our consumers to be able to do those kind of projects.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. And Craig, you've been very careful on the call to categorize your large Pro spending customers as outperforming the overall business. What about the Pro business in totality versus the rest of the business?\nCraig Menear: Our Pro business in total is good, whether it\u2019s, as Carol mentioned, managed accounts, whether it\u2019s our consumer credit card data that shows -- our Pro credit card data that shows. We\u2019ve lost some visibility in the small Pro with our data breach that we\u2019re working to regain. That\u2019s probably why we don\u2019t talk as much about our smaller Pro, but all of the data points that we have indicate that our Pro businesses is very solid and we\u2019re pleased with the results, whether that\u2019s within categories or whether it\u2019s at the customer data that we have specifically.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: To put some numbers behind it, if you just look at Pro sales on our private label credit card as well as managed accounts, we know those sales. They make up 20% of our sales in the third quarter and they grew faster than the company.\nMichael Lasser: My last question you fully anniversaried the data breach from a year ago. Do you think -- as you look back now, do you think that the breach had any impact on traffic to the stores in light of how strong traffic was for this period?\nCraig Menear: It\u2019s really, really hard to tell clearly. If you think back a year ago on our call, we talked about the fact that we\u2019re pleased that each month had positive transaction growth despite the breach. We again saw positive transaction growth as Carol mentioned just a minute ago. When you look at a two years back comp basis, we\u2019ve seen progression in two year comps quarter after quarter after quarter and we anticipate that we\u2019ll be able to do that again this quarter. So it\u2019s really difficult to get at that number. The only other thing I can tell you is as we said last year, we know that there are customers who were upset based on the emails that we got. So there had to be some impact. It\u2019s just really hard to quantify.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. Thank you so much and have a good holiday.\nDiane Dayhoff: Allan, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Then we\u2019ll take our last question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli: Hey guys, how are you? I believe you guys saw a bit of a slowdown in some of the energy heavy markets in Canada maybe nine months, 12 months ago or so after entry prices turned down. So I guess the question is, are you surprised you haven't seen more of an impact in some of the energy heavy markets in the US and what would those differences be?\nCraig Menear: It\u2019s something that we were watching very, very carefully and certainly thought we might see some impact, but candidly in Texas would be the biggest market that would have those kind of impacts, we really haven\u2019t seen it at all. As I mentioned earlier, all of our major markets in Texas actually outperformed the company average comps and we\u2019ve seen strength across the store.\nScot Ciccarelli: And then I guess the last question since this is the last question on the board here, Carol, any update on the extended terms test for the Pro customer? I thought we were expected to hear something about that sometime in the fall timeframe.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: You\u2019re going to hear all about it on December 8.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got you. All right, thanks a lot, guys.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you at our investors and analysts conference next month.\nOperator: That does conclude today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2015, "date": "2015-08-18 14:33:04", "content": "Executives: Diane Dayhoff - Vice President-Investor Relations Craig A.

Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $24.8 billion, up 4.3% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.2% from last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.73 in the second quarter, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.7%. For the first half, sales grew over $2.2 billion, or 5.1%, exceeding our plan even in the face of a stronger U.S. dollar. We are pleased with this quarter's performance. All three of our U.S. divisions exceeded their sales plan with mid to high-single digit comps and all of our 19 regions and top 40 markets also posted positive comps in the quarter. We had a record number of transactions this quarter and our highest quarterly average ticket going back to 2006. As Ted will detail, the core of the store continues to perform well. Our objective is to create balance in our business. During the quarter, we continued to see growth in DIY and heavy pro categories as well as our Installation Services business. During the quarter, we announced recent actions taken to further invest in growing our pro business. We remain focused on addressing the needs of the pro customer through helping them build a better business. This includes providing solutions to the pro in our stores and also at the job site. During the quarter, we reached an agreement to acquire Interline Brands, a leading national distributor of maintenance, repair, and operations, or MRO, products. Interline's expertise in hospitality, multifamily, and institutional MRO, brings strong fulfillment and sales capability to The Home Depot and the residential MRO product market. We believe that we can leverage their capabilities to expand our share of wallet with our current customers as well as gain new customers currently served by Interline. We also named Bill Lennie, a 20-plus year Home Depot veteran, to lead our newly formed Outside Sales & Service team. Through aligning our pro, MRO and Installation Services functions, we believe we can better serve our pro and consumers through a more streamlined and focused approach. I'd like to congratulate Bill on his promotion and also look forward to welcoming the Interline team into The Home Depot family as we plan to complete the acquisition in the third quarter. Internationally, our Mexican business had another quarter of solid performance with positive comps in local currency for the 47th consecutive quarter. And our Canadian business also posted positive comps in local currency, making it 15 consecutive quarters of positive comps. We remain on a journey to build out interconnected capabilities to meet the customers' changing needs. We had another quarter of strong growth in our digital assets with dotcom sales growing approximately 25%, led by online orders picked up in the store through Buy Online, Pick Up In Store, BOPUS; and Buy Online, Ship to Store, BOSS. At the same time, our operations team remains focused on improving the interconnected customer experience in the store. And as a result, we saw another quarter of year-over-year improvement in customer satisfaction scores for our BOPUS and BOSS offerings in the second quarter. Our dotcom team continues to expand our capabilities to solve our customers' needs through our online properties. During the quarter, we improved our mobile experience, invested in content and made site improvements to take friction out for our customers. Our online channel represented 5% of sales in the second quarter. We're investing in our supply chain as well to support our online growth. Mark Holifield and our supply chain team completed the build-out of and have begun to receive product in our third direct fulfillment center, or DFC, located in Troy Township, Ohio. We will begin shipping product to customers out of this facility in the third quarter. This facility, along with our two other DFC's in California and Georgia, will give us the capability to reach 90% of our U.S. customers with two-day or less parcel shipping. We're pleased with the performance in the first half of the year, and while 2015 consensus U.S. GDP growth projections are moderate, housing data remains supportive of the continued growth in home improvement industry. As Carol will detail, we are increasing our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year to reflect the outperformance of the quarter and the expected benefit from the anticipated completion of the Interline acquisition in the third quarter. Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work, dedication, and commitment to our customers. Based on this quarter's results, over 99% of our stores qualified for our first half Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with our performance in the second quarter as we saw continued strength across the store. The departments that outperformed the company's average comps were appliances, tools, plumbing, d\u00e9cor, lighting, kitchen and bath, hardware and flooring. Millwork, building materials, indoor garden, electrical, lumber and paint were positive but below the company average. Outdoor garden was slightly negative. Pro heavy categories continue to show great strength and we saw double digit comps in water heaters, power tools, commercial lighting, flooring tools and materials and power tool accessories. In addition, siding, builders' hardware, compressors, boards, gypsum, fasteners, concrete and insulation had comps above the company average. The core of the store continued to perform as well as we saw strength in maintenance and repair categories. Air circulation and hand tools had double digit comps. While cleaning, wiring devices, circuit protectors, plumbing repair parts, pipe and fittings and light bulbs all had comps above the company average. In d\u00e9cor categories, tile, in-stock kitchens, recessed lighting, bath fixtures, vanities, ceiling fans, faucets, interior lighting and bath accessories also had comps above the company average. Once again, our events delivered strong sales with the Memorial Day and Fourth of July events leading the way. Our customers responded to great values which drove double-digit comps in appliances led by cooking, dishwashers and refrigeration. Outdoor project categories like soils and mulch, live goods and fertilizers were pressured during the quarter specifically from weather that impacted certain areas of the country like the drought in California and record rainfall in parts of Texas and the Midwest. Total comp transactions grew by 2.5% for the quarter while comp average ticket increased 1.7%. On top of the impact with a stronger U.S. dollar, our average ticket increase was negatively impacted by commodity price deflation, mainly from lumber, copper and building materials. The total impact to ticket growth from commodity price deflation was approximately negative 19 basis points. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were slightly positive in the second quarter and reflect the negative weather impact to outdoor project categories like live goods. Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 6.3% in the second quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were appliances, water heaters, windows and riding mowers. Our journey in merchandising transformation continues. Utilizing our regional merchandising managers and our planning and assortment tools, we've recently refined our assortment in cleaning. Based on customer demand and analytical data, we expanded our offering in the category. In addition to refreshes in subcategories like sponges, gloves, and brooms, we expanded our air care and laundry offering and are very pleased with the results. Now let me turn our attention to the third quarter. We have an exciting lineup of exclusive new products for our pro customers, led by the 20-volt MAX sliding miter saw from DEWALT. This innovative miter saw features the integrated XPS crosscut system that allows for enhanced precision in a variety of cutting jobs. It is compact and lightweight, allowing for easy transport and storage, which will save our pros time and money on the job site. New from Commercial Electric is the LED Smart Downlight. This easy to install recessed light system is wink-enabled, and the color temperature of the lights can be wirelessly controlled through a mobile device. This is the first color tuning smart LED downlight of its kind, and it is exclusive to The Home Depot. For our DIY customer, we are pleased to introduce an exclusive carpet assortment called LifeProof, featuring texture, twist, loop, and patterned styles. This innovative carpet has lifetime stain protection and can withstand common household spills, including ketchup, red wine, and even soy sauce. It offers superior softness, exceptional durability, and is perfect for families with children and pets. In addition to all the great new products, we're excited about our upcoming events. The fall season and cooler temperatures are just around the corner, and we have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys for our customers during our Labor Day, Fall Cleanup, and Halloween Harvest events. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Thank you, Ted, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $24.8 million, a 4.3% increase from last year. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $365 million or 1.5%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 4.2% for the quarter, with positive comps of 2.6% in May, 3.6% in June, and 6.1% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 3.5% in May, 5.1% in June, and 8.2% in July. Our total company gross margin was 33.7% for the quarter, an increase of six basis points from last year. The change to gross margin was driven by multiple factors. First, we had 27 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, due primarily to increased productivity in our distribution network and lower fuel costs. Second, we had six basis points of gross margin expansion from lower shrink due to operational enhancements. And finally, we had 27 basis points of gross margin contraction, due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold and some commodity price deflation. For fiscal 2015, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2014. In the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 15 basis points to 19%. Our second quarter expenses include $153 million of gross expenses incurred as part of our data breach, the majority of which were for an accrual for estimated probable losses that we expect to incur in connection with claims made by the payment card networks. Our net breach-related expenses after insurance were $92 million. Excluding the net breach-related expenses, our expenses grew at 35%, the rate of sales growth, better than our plan, reflecting solid expense control and sales leverage. One more comment on our breach-related expenses, beginning in the third quarter of last year and through the second quarter of this year, our gross breach-related expenses totaled $232 million, and our net breach-related expenses after claiming reimbursement from our $100 million insurance policy were $132 million. Looking ahead, we expect to have some ongoing expenses related to the breach. Our operating margin for the quarter was 14.7% and for the first six months of fiscal 2015 was 13.7%. Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $84 million, down $107 million from last year. The year-over-year change reflects two items. First, interest and investment income increased by $132 million, due primarily to a pre-tax gain of $144 million on the sale of HD Supply common stock, as during the quarter we liquidated our remaining position in HD Supply. Second, interest expense increased by $25 million from last year, due primarily to higher long-term debt balances. At the end of May, we raised $2.5 billion of new senior notes. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 37.3%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 36.5% for the year. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.73, an increase of 13.8% from last year. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter included a $0.07 benefit related to the gain on sale of HD Supply common stock as well as a $0.05 detriment related to the net expenses incurred as part of the data breach. Total sales per square foot for the second quarter were $420, up 4.1% from last year. And at the end of the quarter, inventory was $11.9 billion, up slightly from last year, but that's a bit distorted due to a stronger U.S. dollar. On a currency neutral basis, inventory dollars were up approximately $435 million. Inventory turns were 5.1 times compared to 4.9 times last year. Payables were up $330 million from last year, but our payables were also distorted by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. On a currency neutral basis, payables were up $459 million from the prior year. In the second quarter, we repurchased $2 billion or approximately 16.1 million shares of outstanding stock. This included 4.1 million shares repurchased in the open market and 12 million shares repurchased through an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, program. For the shares repurchased under the second quarter ASR program, this is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon the completion of the ASR in the third quarter. Now, you may recall we planned to repurchase $4.5 billion of our outstanding shares in fiscal 2015 using excess cash. In the second quarter, we raised $2.5 billion of incremental long-term debt and we will use the proceeds from that debt offering to increase our share repurchases to $7 billion for the year, of which $3.9 billion will occur in the back half of the year. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 24.9%, 300 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2014. One more comment on capital allocation. As you know, we signed an agreement to purchase Interline and expect the closing to occur in the third quarter. We expect to fund the acquisition immediately with cash on hand but do plan to tap the long-term debt markets in the fall and raise incremental indebtedness in support of this acquisition. As a result, and after giving consideration to the long-term debt we raised in the second quarter, our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio will be slightly over two times. Now, moving to our guidance, we continue to see positive signs in the housing market. Home prices continue to appreciate and housing turnover and household formation are now slightly ahead of the assumptions we use to build our plan. While strength in the U.S. dollar continues to be a headwind, our reported sales in the second quarter were better than our sales plan. Our earnings per share were also stronger than our plan for the second quarter. Further, the acquisition of Interline will add sales and earnings that were not included in our previous guidance. As a result, we are raising our sales and earnings per share growth guidance. We now expect our fiscal 2015 sales to grow by approximately 6% with comps of approximately 4.9%. If the U.S. dollar remains at current foreign exchange rates, we would expect our fiscal 2015 sales growth rate to be 5.2% and comps to be approximately 4.1%. Based on our year-to-date performance which includes breach-related costs that have been incurred this year and including the impact of the Interline acquisition, we now expect our fiscal 2015 expenses to grow approximately 48% of our sales growth rate. Excluding breach-related costs, we expect our fiscal 2015 expenses to grow at approximately 39% of our sales growth rate. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 13.8% to $5.36. But if exchange rates remain where they are today, our projected fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share would be approximately $5.31. Our updated earnings per share guidance include our outperformance for the second quarter and about $0.01 of earnings per share attributable to the Interline acquisition. Our earnings per share guidance also include the impact of the new capital allocation items I previously mentioned. So, we thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Derek, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: We'll take our first question from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thanks very much. Congrats, guys, on a great quarter.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I was wondering if you could elaborate on how Interline addresses the needs of the pro as you alluded to in your commentary. And I guess, in general, how will that tie in and support the existing pro initiatives that you have in place such as delivery and credit extension? And then I realize it's early and the deal hasn't closed yet, but if you could maybe just walk through the integration plans and where you see some of the opportunities?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So from a strategic standpoint, we think about Interline and the capability to really take an end-to-end approach with our customers. In today's environment, we have the ability in many of these faces to handle the remodel portion of the business. But don't do as well on the maintenance and repair portion. If you think about Interline, they actually do that side and don't have the capability to do the remodel. So we can take an end-to-end look at how we service the customers and grow our share of wallet with them overall. So, we're excited about the opportunity that we have to not only grow with our current customers by giving them this new capability but also with the customers \u2013 the new customers that Interline brings to the business.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And I guess from a financial perspective, embedded in the guidance is some small accretion from the deal. But how should we be thinking about some of the financial parameters around the opportunity here related to this over the next year or so?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Yes. Perhaps I can give you a little bit more color about the guidance that we've prepared. Included in our growth guidance for the year is about $750 million of sales related to Interline in the back half of the year and about a $0.01 of EPS accretion, but that $0.01 is after the financing costs because we are going to tap the long-term debt markets and raise financing in support of the deal. So the operating profit for the back half of the year is around $50 million and when you add the interest expense and after tax, it's about a $0.01. Looking ahead, we would expect synergies coming off of this deal in a couple of different fashions. First, as Craig mentioned, is the ability to get more sales. We are both selling the customer and we are not satisfying that customer's needs completely. So with an end-to-end process, we believe we will get more sales. That's the first synergy. The second synergy is on the cost of sales. We have 42% overlap with our supplier base. We think there is margin accretion just by leveraging a common supplier base. And then clearly there is SG&A opportunities as well. So, we didn't buy the deal just for \u2013 or not buying the deal just for the synergies, however. It's really about the opportunity to serve our customer that we're currently serving today but not serving completely.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. A couple of different things. First, the industry growth was quite a bit slower in the second quarter than where it had been trending. Can you give some perspective on what do you think the flavor of that growth was? Was it just due to some of the weather that impacted maybe the nurseries in certain parts of the country and what precipitated the share gain for Home Depot during the time?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: In the industry, again I think depending on if you're looking at census data or some of the callouts from folks that have reported, I think there were certainly some impacts in certain categories from what happened with weather as it relates \u2013 as Ted called out, the drought in California certainly hurt categories like live goods and mulch and then heavy rains clearly in parts of the country as well. In large part, we obviously were able to offset that and that came through strength across the store and continued strength and balance in our business with our DIY as well as our pro customers as well our services business. And share gains are something that we've been focused on for a number of years now and it's all about staying focused on the value proposition that we give to our customers and understanding their needs. So I think we were able to take share across many categories in the store.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank: And, Craig, on the flow throughout the quarter, do you see some of the sales that were lost early in the period fall into the later period given the monthly breakdown? Or was it different categories that contributed later in the period such as air conditioning given the heat?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, we did \u2013 so air conditioning is a great point. We did see a more normal summer from an air standpoint in comparison to a year ago. If you look at outdoor garden for us, which was negative in this quarter on the half we had a positive comp. So it's the bathtub effect that usually happens with spring. You never know when it's going to break and what parts of the country. But pleased with the half performance on that overall.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank: And then let me just add one last question on the acquisition activity during the period. Do you look at this as kind of a one-time deal or do you look at it as a platform to build those capabilities even further into the maintenance and repair market and perhaps even other areas of the industrial supply sector given some of the history that the company has with that sector?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, we don't have any intent at this point to continue to acquire more capability. We believe with the acquisition that we've made that we've actually acquired the capabilities that we want to have and we'll now focus on how we serve our customers in both sides of the organizations and grow them.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank: Awesome. Thank you so much.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research.\nKatharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you, good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nKatharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): My question is on the direct fulfillment centers. Now that you've opened your third one and you are reaching a majority of your customers with two-day delivery, do you think you need anymore and how much more efficient can those centers get over time?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, obviously, we're just in the stages of opening our third one and receiving product into that building. So it's very, very early days, but Mark Holifield is here. I'll let him comment.\nMark Holifield - Executive VP-Supply Chain & Product Development: As Craig mentioned, the third one is now in the process of stocking. We think that three will do us fine for the stated goal of getting the customers on two-day parcel delivery. The thing to keep in mind about The Home Depot is, in addition to the three direct fulfillment centers, we have 2,000 stores that are conveniently located, and we're working on delivery capability from the stores. So we look at the stores to really be the expedited capability to put product in the hands of customers. We think that these three will do us fine as we look to get the second day delivery of parcels\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: And, Kate, if I could just jump in on the financial side, as you heard, we had great productivity in our supply chain in the second quarter. We did in the first quarter as well. As we look at the back half of the year, we wouldn't expect to see that kind of productivity because as we go into the back half of the year, we have a higher penetration of imported products, and international shipping comes at a higher cost. So while we're going to drive productivity, don't expect to see the kinds of gains that you've seen recently.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.\nChris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, this is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Hi.\nChris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC: I was wondering if you could talk about conditions out West with the drought that has occurred for a few years now. I just wonder if you're seeing any shift in consumer behavior. Are people throwing more money at the problem into adjacent categories as they try and tackle the drought, or is it shifting into unrelated categories?\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: What we're doing in the live goods category specific, we've definitely shifted the assortment into water-tolerant or drought-tolerant species, so a lot more cactus and succulents. We're also diminishing the size of live goods in a number of stores and expanding pavers and the like, as we see people definitely taking grass, diminishing the size of their lawn, and putting in more pavers and succulents.\nChris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC: Got you, okay. And then how about related, I guess, just general severe rainfall and weather, how does that usually impact the consumer behavior? Is that just you lose those sales or do you see people prioritize other projects around the house?\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: I don't think we see a loss in sales. But certainly, as Craig said, in timing and the bathtub effect, if you take the rain that we had in Texas and the Midwest, for example, in the earlier part of the spring, certainly sales suffered, and that's part of the pickup you see in our comp in July. The rain finally stopped and all the grass and weeds started to grow. So we had a very strong July in those markets with outdoor garden and indoor garden.\nChris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay, cool. And not to hit weather too hard, but just one last one. As you anticipate El Ni\u00f1o coming around this time of year, it looks like it's going to be pretty severe. Anything you're doing to prepare for it based on past experiences with it?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's something that we do on an ongoing basis. We have plans that we put together as, if you will, anticipation of events. We're actually pretty good at this, and so we're prepared for any adjustments we need to make as a result of that.\nChris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay, great. Thanks for the help.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: ...on the seasonal shift. Can you talk about the core business, say, ex-outdoor seasonal comp in the second quarter and compare that to what that level was in the first quarter?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Chris, we couldn't hear you when you began your question.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So I'm trying to figure out what the underlying growth in the core business ex-the seasonal shift is in the second quarter relative to what you saw in the first quarter.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: I think the performance of the core of the store, as we call it, is similar. It remains very, very strong. Our hardware business, our plumbing business, appliance business, flooring business, the categories that have been strong continue strong. Our hard set, for example, in flooring, tile and tile set, and wood and laminate, remains very strong. Our power tools and power tool accessories and hand tools remain very strong, plumbing, water heaters, pipe and fitting, et cetera. So that core DIY product and pro heavy product, the rate of sale has continued strong into Q2.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, understood. And then on the SG&A expense growth rate versus the sales growth rate, Carol, it looks like it picks up in the back half of the year. Is something changing? Does any of it have to do with the timing of bonus accruals and perhaps wage pressures in the business?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: It does kick up in the back half of the year for a couple of reasons. First, we have the Interline acquisition in our guidance, and Interline has a different cost structure than our core retail business. Also, we have some expense good guys that will not repeat themselves we do not believe in the back half, particularly in relation to some casualty reserve adjustments that were taken last year that we don't think will repeat this year.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then last question is given the early good spring sales and then this shortened season in the second quarter, did you change your planned promotional posture during the quarter, and what did you see out in the market? Thanks.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, we really didn't change any promotional cadence on our part. Ted, I don't know...\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: I don't think it was any more or less promotional than prior years.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And really don't see a ton of change in the marketplace.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: No.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning, nice quarter.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Thank you.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): A question on the pro and I know some other questions already addressed the pro. But as I look at it and as a listen to the call today and maybe a couple of your past calls, it seems to me Home Depot is putting a bigger and bigger emphasis on attacking this pro customer with maybe more directed merchandise numbers and such. As you're doing this and with the Interline or some of the merchandise numbers, are you seeing an almost immediate pickup in that pro business? In other words, is the pro sales inflecting higher? And that's the first question. The second question, as you look further down the road, how big do you think now the pro opportunity is for Home Depot?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: As it relates to the reaction, if you will, of the pro, we've been focused on the pro, as you know, for quite some time. It's a very important customer base of ours. But we do believe that we have a fair amount of opportunity to expand our share of wallet penetration with this customer. We have obviously not completed the acquisition, so we haven't seen any benefit as a result of our intended acquisition of Interline, but believe it's an opportunity for us to expand the share of wallet. As Ted detailed, we are very pleased with the performance that we are seeing in pro categories. And that's I think a reflection of the continued rebound in the economy, the continued rebound in home values where customers are more willing today to invest in their home than what they were obviously during the economic downturn.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: And if we look at our managed accounts and those pro customers who tend are using our private label credit card, those two groups of pro customers make up about 20% of our sales. We saw that their growth rate was higher than the company average. So to your question, are seeing a bang for your buck, well, yes, we see sales performance that's outperforming the company average.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then as a follow-up separately, Carol, any comment on, I know it's early in the third quarter but any comment on sales, sales quarter to date?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: I'm happy to comment on quarter to date performance. We're very pleased.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): I appreciate that. Thank you.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: You're welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: My first question is around big ticket, it seemed like you had pretty good big ticket performance this quarter. I was wondering whether you could attribute to anything specifically that you guys did or more of a macro trend?\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: I would say yes, we've talked a lot about the pro but the consumer business performed very well in Q2 and really was the driver of our ticket performance. So appliances was very strong again and that was driven by our Red, White and Blue event around the Fourth of July. The stores really get behind this and drive the business, and I think that's a distinction for Home Depot. Our kitchen and countertop business likewise was very strong in the quarter. I mentioned flooring. We saw strong sales across the flooring category, but particularly in hard surface. And then we even saw things like special order window coverings as we leverage the Blinds.com acquisition. We are seeing nice sales out of Blinds.com platform and the work they've done for our business in The Home Depot is driving that business. And then the riding mower business and walks and all outdoor power performed very well and we have a lot of new programs like the new Cub Cadet tractor that's performing very well for us this year in our lineup of all the top brands and walks. So, very strong consumer and I think in each of those examples are things where The Home Depot is driving the business.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: We get a little bit from the economy too. Home price appreciation continues to progress nicely, prices are up 4% and as we talked about, when consumers believe their home as an investment and not an expense, they spend differently and we're seeing that spend pattern.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. As you look at the outlook from a macro standpoint with a good likelihood of rising interest rates, do you think that might quell some of the demand for big ticket items going forward over the next year?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think when you look at historical trends, we've been so far below the market that at this point we don't think we'll see a major impact to the business.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you and good luck.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, thank you.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot, good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: My first question relates to same-store sales. So last quarter you gave us some fairly fine tune commentary about the relationship of the two halves from a sales perspective. And in particular just triangulating what you've been saying for the past several quarters, it sounded like you'd originally expected the second quarter to be the softest same-store sales quarter of the year. So given that you outperformed your plan for Q2, do you continue to expect that to mark the low end of the comp range for the year? Or is there a new cadence that you have in mind?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: If we look at the high end of our guidance which is basically currency neutral for Q3 and Q4, we would still expect the second quarter to be the lowest comping quarter because it had the FX impact in it. So \u2013 but there's not a lot of difference, Matt, between the first half and the second half, again, using that high end of our guidance, we would expect the second half to be slightly under the first half, but not materially different.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up, Carol, you talked about the leverage ratio going above two times to get the Interline deal funded. As you think about going forward into 2016 and beyond just theoretically are you comfortable living at that level of leverage, i.e., maintaining it and continuing to buy back stock and fund it as you have? Or you would you want to work that back down below two times as the cash flow continues to come in?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Well, as we continue to earn more, that ratio will naturally decline and it's not our intent to let it decline. Keeping it at around the two times is our intent.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Mace with Nomura Securities.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi, good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: In an earlier question you talked a little bit about your performance versus the overall market and I was wondering if you could mention maybe any competitive dynamics that there might be to call out any categories where you're seeing big opportunities or maybe the competitive environment is intensifying?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, I think as I referenced earlier, we're not seeing a major shift in competitive environment in total. I can tell you paint is a pretty competitive market. It's probably as competitive as it has been. It seems like a lot of folks are focusing there. But overall, I wouldn't say that we're seeing big changes in the competitive environment.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: All right, thanks. And then on your strong performance in big ticket as you said earlier, anything on the 1.7% growth in average ticket, anything to call out other than FX and deflation to keep in mind about different dynamics going on there?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: No, you've got it.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: All right, thanks so much for taking the questions.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we we'll hear from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys, Scot Ciccarelli. I guess my first question is I know you guys have been running some tests on the pro side with credit extension and, let's call it, tighter delivery windows of the new system. Is there any way to provide some color regarding what you guys are currently seeing and when might we hear whether this is a full rollout on these two programs?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: I can start on the credit side. We've been in pilot now for a while, we're in a pilot at about 262 stores. We really like the results. We're optimizing our sales performance and our expense performance, we really like the results. But as you know, we had a data breach last year that we needed to get through. We're rolling out EMV this year. So we've just got a lot of changes going on in terms of the front end of our store and accepting credit. So it puts a decision to roll that out on hold until we get through really EMV and EMV deadline, as you know, is October 1. So stay tuned for more to come in that regard. And, Mark, maybe you want to talk about delivery?\nMark Holifield - Executive VP-Supply Chain & Product Development: Sure. We're in four markets with our Buy Online, Deliver From Store implementation. Something to keep in mind is virtually all of our stores are in the delivery business, it's just that we're now enabling the buy online component of that. And as part of that, we're enabling tighter delivery windows. So we're in four markets now. We're working to really perfect that and make that a flawless customer experience. I would say that tighter time windows are harder to meet than all-day windows, so we want to be absolutely certain that we can meet those before we roll further, but we would expect to roll that through 2016.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Well, I know you guys have \u2013 obviously, you're testing a lot of different things as somebody \u2013 Brian mentioned before. You guys have continued to add brands, you've just bought Interline. Are there any big holes in your capabilities now with serving the pro? It sounds like you're not necessarily going out to acquire anything but can you identify anywhere where you feel like you really need to improve on the pro or do you think you have that blanketed at this stage?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I mean, I think the number of these things that we're working on, as you've heard, around the credit, around delivery and continuing to narrow the windows, the ability with the acquisition to have a dedicated sales force that can hit to the job site, and candidly, the organizational change that we made with Bill are important pieces to allow us to begin to drive change and improvement in the share of wallet with our customer base and to expand our customer base. So we feel like we are working towards all the right capabilities that we need to have and look forward to getting them all in place across the organization and then really looking to leverage that and provide a better experience for our pro customers.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Excellent. Thanks a lot, guys.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.\nKeith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you and yet another Interline pro customer question. If you look several years down the road with Interline, will you try to integrate the service function, the delivery function that is so important at least in the MRO piece of that business with what you just described with more of the deliveries coming out of the orange box stores?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think you could probably assume that'll be part of the plan as we go forward.\nKeith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And would you take that and then bolt-on to other pro submarkets beyond the reach of Interline currently?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I doubt it.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: The addressable market is $50 billion. Between Home Depot and Interline, we have less than 5% market share. Just growing in that addressable market of a customer we already serve is a lot of growth opportunity for us.\nKeith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Second question and final question, you had called out flooring as above the comp, you talked about hard surface growing. You appear to be doing a lot better than the industry at this point. Is there any one specific promotion that's working a (47:06) product, just any sort of detail there would be helpful.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: No. I think we continue to bring newness and innovation into that space, both in terms of the product as well as the way we go to market. In the store, we have a number of different sets and configurations in our stores where we're emphasizing based on clustering work where we're emphasizing hard surface versus soft surface. And then the new LifeProof carpet that we just launched, we're very excited about that, that stain-resistant guarantee. We're seeing very strong early results with the LifeProof. So it's all about innovation and go-to-market in the stores.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I would say that it's leveraging the capabilities that we've built over the last few years in terms of our assortment planning capabilities and really clustering to get it right.\nKeith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks and nice quarter as usual, a question about the shape of the housing recovery. I'm not sure if it's my words or yours, but we've been characterizing it as mid-cycle, and you've been telling a story of a pretty balanced comp from a category perspective. But can you discuss anything you're seeing geographically by market that can inform the shape of the recovery, whether maybe it is earlier than mid-cycle or even later in some markets based on what you're seeing projects being done?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: We're seeking to understand that as well. We looked at the comp variability by region, and we have 19 regions in the United States. And interestingly, if you look at the high to low, there's a 6.5 percentage point difference. That's exactly what it was a year ago. So we're not seeing any regional differences that really help us inform the shape of the housing recovery. So then we go back to the overall macro, and here's where we see that home price appreciation is continuing. Home prices are up 4%. They have not fully recovered. Housing turnover is higher than what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. We see some interesting dynamics happening with household formation. And in fact, 1.6 million households were formed in the second quarter. This is something that we have been hoping for. Now, not all those households are going into single-family units. They're going into rental units, but that's okay because we can serve those rental units. It's really interesting to note that of the 135 million housing units in the United States, 44 million of those are rental units; and of those, 13 million are single-family homes. So we can sell that customer and now we can sell with the acquisition soon to be completed of Interline, we can sell the MRO customer in ways that we've never sold before.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: In comparison, if you think back during the difficult times of the economic downturn, the variability by market was significant in comparison to what Carol just described, where basically the spread is the same as what it was a year ago. So it's for sure stable.\nSimeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And household formation data, that doesn't come out regionally. Do you have a sense to see how that shapes up by geography?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: We don't. We are trying to get behind the covers...\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Right.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: ... but we don't have that today.\nSimeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right, okay. And my follow-up, a question on wage inflation. And this applies to HD but maybe also a bigger generic question for the industry. Because I think the conversation is evolving a little bit where initially it was about just rising minimum wages, and now we're starting to hear retailers talk about wage creep across their cost structures. And so I'm curious how, I guess curious how you think of that. Is that fair, and how is Home Depot planning to deal with it?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We look at wage obviously on a market-by-market basis. We are constantly and have been for years adjusting based on the market dynamics. We've made thousands and thousands of adjustments this year, as we would in previous years. We pride ourselves on trying to make sure that we have compensation overall that is above market, and that's something that we will continue to focus to do. But clearly, there are markets where we've had to make adjustments, and we've done so.\nSimeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDolph B. Warburton - Jefferies LLC: Hi, this is Dolph Warburton on for Dan.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: How are you doing?\nDolph B. Warburton - Jefferies LLC: Good. Good. Can you talk a little bit about your ad spend for the year and how this will look versus last year as well as the mix of digital versus print?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So our ad spend is pretty flat year over year. And we have been for numerous years now in an effort to shift our spend to new mediums and platforms. As an example, if you step back, several years ago we had on average over 50 print pieces that hit the street in a year. I think this year we'll do something like 11. So we've made a pretty hard shift to new platforms in the digital space.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: That allows us actually to have more impressions...\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Correct.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: ...than we had year on year. By the way, we've changed the mix.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And more targeted messages, if you will, based on what the customer is looking for. So we are actually very pleased with the productivity of our ad spend and what our marketing team is doing to reach the customer and provide information around what it is the customer is looking for.\nDolph B. Warburton - Jefferies LLC: Okay, great. Thanks. And if I could ask one last question on the piloting of the auto supply products and how that's going. Thank you.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We are pleased with that. Ted, I don't know if you want to comment.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Yeah. So we're very pleased with that. We have a one or two-bay set in all stores. And then in 500 odd stores at the end of the second quarter, we had an extended set of up to six bays. And we're looking at the different locations in the store. If the category is more productive in the front ends or in bay, so we have various tests going on with those six-bay sets and very pleased. Again, this is very much a DIY auto. It's a traffic driver and a convenience for our customer.\nDolph B. Warburton - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff - Vice President-Investor Relations: Derek, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from David Schick with Stifel.\nDavid A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, look at that. Thank you. So home automation, you mentioned in some of the products, even in pro enabled products around home automation, you see it when you land on your page online. We see it in the stores as we walk the stores. Obviously, you're talking about hard flooring which is not a home automation product yet. But talk about home automation and how it's driving the business at all with new customers. Or any color you can give around home automation and if it's how it's changing your view to driving the business.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I'd start with our key focus around home automation is around product. And it starts with making sure that we're giving the customer choice around product that is enabled. And, Ted, I don't know if you want to provide any specifics.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Yes, so we have hundreds of products now that are in some sense interconnected or smart enabled. We're very happy with our Wink platform that is an agnostic platform in that any and all products can link into the Wink system. And I would say that we're focused on functionality versus gimmickry. So the use cases are maturing for the customer and we're seeing products fulfilling use cases, so say in a water heater where if you're away on vacation and you forgot to turn down the water heater, from your phone you can turn down the temperature. You can obviously dim lights. I mentioned the LED light that we're able to change the color temperature of the light. So we're actually starting to see nice features that benefit real-life use cases and we're investing in that product across the store and seeing great lifts in all categories we introduce relevant smart products.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think the other...\nDavid A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sorry, go ahead.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Just the other comment would be you will continue to see products over the next several years, I think, being integrated into more and more technology. So I think this is an opportunity as we go forward.\nDavid A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And do you think that's a different new customer or it's your same customer is discovering these capabilities?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Same customers finding this new product to be very convenient.\nDavid A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to joining you next quarter.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference.

Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $20.9 billion, total sales and comp sales were up 6.1% from last year, diluted earnings per share were $1.21 in the first quarter and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.1%. We were pleased with the start of the year. We saw a more normal spring across much of the country in the first quarter. All three of our U.S. divisions posted mid-single-digit comps or higher, our Western division was our best performing division with strength in key markets, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Colorado and Seattle. All 19 of our U.S. regions saw positive comp growth in the quarter. Both tickets and transactions grew during the quarter with particular strength in transaction growth. While our seasonal businesses were strong in the quarter, core categories also contributed to our performance. As Ted will detail, we were pleased with the growth in our Pro categories. And our Installation Service business saw sales growth above the company average in the first quarter with strength in countertops, windows and water heaters. On the international front, both our Mexican and Canadian businesses exceeded our expectations in the quarter. Ricardo and his team in Mexico posted double-digit comps in local currency, making it 46 consecutive quarters of positive comps. And Bill and the Canadian team posted comps in local currency above the company average, making it 14 consecutive quarters of positive comps. Operationally, in the quarter, we hired over 75,000 associates to ramp up for our spring season. Flexibility is required to be successful in spring and our associates and store operators were able to do just that. They officially managed the freight flow within the store, while maintaining focus on providing strong customer service in the aisle. And our second-generation First Phone enabled us to expedite the checkout process for customers during peak traffic periods. We had the highest first quarter transactions in company history and at the same time saw our Net Promoter Scores improved during the quarter. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we expected a challenging transportation environment in the first quarter due to the West Coast ports. While this proved to be true and created some pressure on in-stock rates, our supply-chain team worked vigorously and creatively to mitigate this condition. The situation is improving and we'll continue to work to recover our in-stock levels. The retail environment continues to evolve, blending the digital and physical worlds together, and we at the same time are building out our interconnected capabilities. For the spring season, we work to further connect our in-store and online experiences. From a marketing approach, we leveraged our digital marketing capabilities to more effectively target customers with relevant products and special buys. We not only offered more spring season product online, but also leveraged digital media channels to highlight local in-store assortments and create footsteps to our stores. In the store, our mobile app helped customers identify product locations with our enhanced product locator. We are also interconnecting our distribution networks to more effectively meet the customers' demand for fulfillment options. We have begun to roll-out the capability to flow buy online ship to store orders through our rapid deployment centers or RDCs, creating a more efficient flow to the stores. For the quarter, our online sales grew almost 30% and with our digital properties being our virtual storefront, we were pleased with online traffic growing double-digits in the quarter as well. We will continue to invest in mobile, search and creating a frictionless transaction across the different channels. While it's early in the year, our view of the macro environment has not changed much. The U.S. GDP growth was below consensus estimates for the first quarter, but housing data remains positive and supportive of the housing recovery, and the growth that we see in our business also supports the view of a continued recovery in the U.S. housing market. As Carol will detail, because of our outperformance in the first quarter relative to our plan, we are increasing our sales and our earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect fiscal 2015 sales growth of approximately 4.2% to 4.8%, and project diluted earnings per share of $5.24 to $5.27. We remain focused on investing in our business and our associates as well as taking care of our customers. And I'd like to thank our associates for their hard work and dedication. Based on this quarter's results, 93% of our stores would be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with our performance in the first quarter as we saw continued strength across the store. Sales were aided by a more normal spring and great events, including our annual Spring Black Friday. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were Tools, Indoor Garden, Outdoor Garden, D\u00e9cor, Lighting, Plumbing and Appliances. Kitchen & Bath, Lumber, Hardware, Millwork, Building Materials, Paint, Flooring and Electrical were all positive but below the company average. Pro Heavy categories continue to show great strength as we saw double-digit comps in Siding, Power Tools, Commercial Lighting, Fencing and Power Tool Accessories. In addition, pressure-treated decking, compressors, windows, tile-setting materials, concrete, board, insulation and fasteners all had comps above the company average. Outdoor project categories were also strong during the quarter as we had double-digit comp sales in Lawnmowers, Chemicals, Outdoor Power Equipment, Planters, Lawn Accessories and Grills. The core of the store continued to perform well across the country as we saw strength in Maintenance and Repair categories. Water Heaters, Cleaning, Hand Tools, Air Circulation, Wiring Devices, Adhesives and Light Bulbs all had comps above the company average. In D\u00e9cor categories, Vanities, special-order cabinets, Ceiling Fans, Bath Fixtures, Decorative Lighting and Tile also had comps above the company average. Our seventh annual Spring Black Friday delivered strong sales as the stores drove excitement around special buys that were well-received by our customers. Comps in Gardening Tools, Soils and Mulch, Watering, Live Goods and Patio were all above the company average. We continue to work to mitigate the effects of the drought in California using our planning and assortment tools. We're featuring more water-saving products and landscape options like moisture control soils and mulches, drip irrigation systems and drought-resistant plants like succulents. In addition, our stores in California are holding clinics to educate customers on these products and how to reduce water usage. As a result, both the Indoor and Outdoor Garden departments in the Western division posted comps above the company average. Total comp transactions grew by 4.4% for the quarter, while comp average ticket increased 1.7%. Our average ticket increase was negatively impacted by commodity price deflation, mainly from copper. Total impact to ticket growth from commodity price deflation was approximately negative 15 basis points. Tickets for transactions under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.2% in the first quarter. Transactions tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 6.8% in the first quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were Riding Lawnmowers, Water Heaters, Appliances, Windows and Sheds. Now, let me turn our attention to second quarter. We continue to be the leader in the marketplace for innovation and value that save our customers both time and money. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the exciting lineup of new products for our Pro customers. We are pleased to introduce a new lineup of DEWALT and Makita pneumatic nailers, both exclusively sold at The Home Depot. These are strong national brands that our Pro customers know and trust. The new DEWALT nailers are compact, lightweight and feature innovative True Sight nose technology that allows for faster and more accurate nail placement, saving our Pros' time on the job site. Utilizing our field merchants and our planning and assortment tools, we constantly refine our assortment. Some product categories are sourced nationally and some are sourced regionally. Based on customer preference and the output of our tools, we recently refined our assortment in Roofing. We added an assortment of Owens Corning shingle products in select areas of the United States, including California where they are one of the top professional shingle brands. Pros are increasingly shifting to cordless platforms that offer the power and runtime of gas. New from ECHO is a 58-volt lithium-ion battery platform featuring a string trimmer, hedge trimmer, blower, chainsaw and lawnmower. These tools feature a brushless motor for superior power and performance that rival and in some cases surpass corded and gas-powered counterparts. In addition to all the great new products, we're excited about our upcoming events. The outdoor season is upon us and we will help our customers enjoy it with an incredible lineup of great values and special buys for our Thrill of the Grill, Memorial Day, Father's Day and 4 of July events. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Thank you, Ted, and hello, everyone. Before we discuss our first quarter results, I want to call out a change in our accounting policy for certain shipping and handling costs related to store deliveries and online sales. In order to better align our costs across all selling channels, these shipping and handling costs are now included in cost of sales whereas they were previously included in operating expenses. We changed the policy this year and accordingly have reclassified 2013 and 2014 results. The impact of the reclassification in the first quarter of 2014 was an increase of $128 million to cost of sales and a corresponding decrease of $128 million to operating expenses. For fiscal 2014, the impact of the reclassification was an increase of $565 million to cost of sales and a corresponding decrease of $565 million to operating expenses. The reclassification has no effect on operating income or to net earnings. So with that, let's move on to our first quarter results. In the first quarter, sales were $20.9 billion, a 6.1% increase from last year. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $234 million, or 1.2%. Our total company comp or same store sales were positive 6.1% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.1% in February, 6.8% in March, and 6.8% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.1% for the quarter with positive comps of 5% in February, 7.8% in March and 7.9% in April. Our total company gross margin was 34.4% for the quarter, an increase of four basis points from last year. In the first quarter, we had 21 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply-chain driven by lower fuel costs and increased productivity. This expansion was offset by a change in the mix of products sold and slightly higher shrink than one year ago. For fiscal 2015, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2014, which after applying the change in our accounting policy, was 34.1%. In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 83 basis points to 21.9%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth. Total expenses were $15 million over our plan in the quarter due to $7 million of net expenses incurred as part of our data breach and higher late-season snow removal costs. Given our strong sales performance however, we leveraged expenses to plan. For the year, we are now expecting our expenses to grow at approximately 35% of our sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter was 12.4%. Interest and other expense for the first quarter was $193 million, up $102 million from last year, reflecting for the most part a pre-tax gain of $97 million on the sale of HD Supply common stock, which was not repeated this year. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 34.3%, compared to 36.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The reduction in our first quarter 2015 effective tax rate was due primarily to the settlement of a tax audit. We now expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 36.4% for the year. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.21, an increase of 21% from last year. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter included a $0.05 benefit related to the settlement of the tax audit I just mentioned. Moving on to some additional highlights, during the first quarter we opened one new store in Canada and ended the quarter with a store count of 2,270 and selling square footage of 236 million. Total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $354, up 5.9% from last year. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $12.3 billion, virtually flat to last year. But that's a bit distorted due to a stronger U.S. dollar. On a currency-neutral basis, inventory dollars were up approximately $124 million from last year. Inventory turns were 4.7 times, compared to 4.4 times in the first quarter of last year. Payables were up $331 million from last year, reflecting the seasonal nature of our business. Our payables were also distorted by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. On a currency-neutral basis, payables were up $416 million from the prior year. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.125 billion or approximately 9.9 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.4 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash, bringing total 2015 share repurchases to $4.5 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 26.1%, 490 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2014. When we built our 2015 sales plan, it was based on U.S. GDP growth forecasts of approximately 3% and about 150 basis points of growth coming from continued recovery in the housing market. While GDP was weaker than expected in the first quarter housing data, namely home price appreciation and household formation, were a little ahead of the assumptions we used to build our plan. Even in the face of a stronger U.S. dollar, our sales in the first quarter were better than our internal sales plan. Further, our earnings per share were stronger than our internal plan, reflecting a lower tax rate and more expense productivity than we anticipated. As a result, we are raising our sales and earnings per share growth guidance. On a currency-neutral basis, we now expect our 2015 sales to grow by approximately 4.8% with comps of approximately 4.6%. If the U.S. dollar remains at current foreign exchange rates, we would expect our fiscal 2015 sales growth rate to be 4.2% and comps to be approximately 4%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. On a currency-neutral basis, we now expect fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 12% to $5.27, but if exchange rates remain where they are today, our projected fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share would be approximately $5.24. So, we thank you for your participation in today's call, and Audra, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go first to Seth Basham at Wedbush Securities.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Morning.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: My question is around the big ticket purchases by consumers. Can you talk in more detail about trends you are seeing there, so trends in big ticket purchases not driven by the Pro?\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: I would say that we're seeing really strength across many departments, water heaters, appliances, our tools, riding mowers, walks, all of our outdoor garden categories, grills, et cetera had just a terrific quarter and those wouldn't be Pro-focused items.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: And I might jump in and just give you some demographic information. As we look at our customer base, we're seeing some interesting trends. Since 2009 spending in high income households has grown faster than low income households, driven in part by higher end homes recovering faster than lower end homes, and when we say higher end homes, we are talking of homes of $200,000 and up. Interestingly as we look at our consumer base, over 50% of our customers have homes of $200,000 or more, and you compare that to the national average, which is more like 40%, so we think just the nature of our customer base is helping drive this big ticket growth.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Seth, the other factor that I'd throw in that is our Services business was strong again in this quarter, outpacing our company average, and the average ticket there is north of $1,500.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, does that imply based on the data that you talked about that we're seeing a broadening recovery here with even lower end and mid-income consumers doing more big ticket discretionary projects?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I would say that if you look at the strength both in the small ticket as well as the big-ticket, we're seeing a broad sales pattern across the store and across the demographics.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Chris Horvers at JPMorgan.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Good morning.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Morning.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: You mentioned that this was a normal spring. Do you think there was any pull forward from the second quarter in the spring business? And can you shed some metrics on the way to think about what the underlying trend in the business and where we are in the cycle, so perhaps what Outdoor Categories comped overall relative to what the comp in the core and the Pro was?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I'll let Carol provide you, she has some details in terms of the numbers, but when we look at this business as it's playing out this year, it appears to be much more towards a 2010 type of scenario, which was a more normalized spring overall.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: And here are some numbers. If we look at our garden department, our garden department in the United States made up 19% of our sales and 26% of our growth. If you compare that to last year, which wasn't a normal spring, our garden department made up about 18% of our sales but only 4% of our growth. This ratio of 19% penetration and 26% of growth is more normal for us. So we don't believe that we have pulled forward sales, nor do we believe we will lose sales or grow sales more than our plan in the second quarter.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So you're one of the rare retailers that have reported an acceleration in comp in April. I think a lot of retailers are talking about weakness in April and essentially guiding down the second quarter. So can you shed some light on how you are thinking about the second quarter and what the business is telling you so far in May? Thanks.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Yes. We haven't changed our outlook for the second quarter. In fact, we haven't changed our outlook for the year and if there's a bias in our forecast, we believe the bias is to be up. We are pleased with our performance in May.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning. It's Simeon. How are you? Carol and Craig you guys have done a nice job framing the outlook in terms of macro and housing with the various phases. I think buildup and steady growth, I'm not sure if I am naming them right. Not sure how and if it's incorporated but rising interest rates, inevitable over time, a lot of debate in terms of what we are going to see in terms of magnitude. But in general it should imply an improving macro but I'm curious how rising rates are factored into your outlook and into that longer term, any considerations there?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Well, let's look at the Affordability Index because that's a big impact to how people feel about their homes, what kind of homes they can afford, et cetera. The analysis would suggest that interest rates, and these would be mortgage interest rates, could rise 200 basis points and the Affordability Index would still be north of 100%. So even in the face of potentially higher rates and who knows when that might occur, but even in the face of potentially higher rates, we don't see any near-term pressure on our business. And in fact, to your point, that could suggest a little inflation in the economy and that would be a good thing.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Wouldn't be a bad thing.\nSimeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then my follow-up you mentioned in the script your AP ratio was up I think 300 bps, AP and inventory year-over-year which is quite solid. Can you talk about where it's coming from and has anything, is anything changing in the way you are approaching the payables or your vendors in that regard?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: No. This is just a function of purchases and we're buying up to support the sales.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: It's spring.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: It's springtime, so nothing has changed in our payable terms.\nSimeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Lasser at UBS.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. It's on the nature of the first-quarter sales and how it relates to the rest of the year. If you look at the idiosyncrasies of the quarter, how is it different? Because if we look on a multiyear stack basis not just last year but for the last five years the stack comps on a three- and four-year basis had been lower than you've seen for the rest of the year. And I guess it's important because if we look what your outlook is implying that it's a nice acceleration on that basis, is there something different about the nature of demand as you move out of winter and into spring aside from just the weather?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think if you look at \u2013 we always look at the half first of all, because the quarters in the first half can play out very differently based on how the weather plays. And you're right that the multi, when you look at multi-year stacks the first quarter has had a tendency to be a softer multi-year because for the past several years we've seen slower start to our spring selling season.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: So other than weather, the only other anomaly I can think of was Superstorm Sandy and the impact that it had in terms of creating a real variation in our stacked comp. So those are really the drivers.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. My second question is on the change to the accounting policy. Do you expect that to have any impact on your e-commerce sales which continue to grow at a very impressive clip? For example do you think that the behavior of some of your merchants will change as they are now going to be essentially expend shipping charges? And so how will that manifest in the business mix?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, this is all about driving interconnected retail at Home Depot. Our core merchants are responsible for the sales and margin dollars of all activity, all channels. So they are really looking at two different P&Ls to drive an interconnected experience and give them visibility of their comprehensive profitability and performance of their categories merchandise. And they're very excited about this change to get aligned and have one P&L for the whole business.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: And as Craig pointed out, our dotcom sales grew nearly 30%. In fact, they contributed 20% of our overall company growth in the first quarter. And we made the change at the beginning of the year.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, it's just important to be able to give our merchants common visibility. And we manage our business on a portfolio approach. And to be able to actually look at the businesses in a common way just gives them better information overall.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you so much.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Aram Rubinson at Wolfe Research.\nAram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, good morning. So you've got a merchant now as a CEO and I'm wondering what differences that makes throughout the organization when it comes to maybe pace of innovation on merchandising, speed to markets and even risk in terms of risk taking on the merchandising front. Any perceptible differences there that we should expect?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Aram, I would say that first of all, we've been focused for a while now on trying to create excitement for our customers and our associates in the stores through product innovation and that will continue. It's something that's hugely important not only to, obviously our customers, but we know it's our job as a team to excite our associates. And we firmly believe that when we do excite our associates, they drive it in the marketplace better than anybody out there. So that is our primary focus. I think Ted \u2013 what Ted actually brings to the party is he's taken it to a different level and looking at a much more end-to-end approach from supplier all the way through customer. And I think that piece will be different than what actually I did when I sat in Ted's chair. I can assure you that product will remain a focus for our company.\nAram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC: Let me ask a second question. I know your execution in the stores continues to be excellent. I'm wondering if you can help us benchmark, you touch the customer in a number of different areas, stores, services, buy online, pick up in store, general dotcom. Is there a way for you to handicap your voice of the customer's feedback and grade each of those so we have a sense as to where your execution falls relative to the other businesses?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We actually do look at that under multiple facets and Marc Powers is here. I'll let Marc speak to that.\nMarc D. Powers - Executive Vice President-US Stores: No. We look at our and survey our customers in many different ways through all the channels and pay very close attention to it whether it be our voice of the customer inside the store. We also work with ForeSee to see how we are doing on our execution, on our buy online, pick up in store or our buy online, ship to store. And we also have a VOC for our Pro, how they are experiencing The Home Depot experience with our Pro Xtra program. So anywhere we are contacting and engaging our customer, we are asking them to provide us feedback on their experience and we pay very close attention to it.\nAram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC: And on a scale of 1 to 10, how do we rank in the store versus online versus buy online, pick up in store versus services?\nMarc D. Powers - Executive Vice President-US Stores: I would say in all of those they are trending up, continue to trend up and we are very pleased with the progress we're making in all channels with our customer experience.\nAram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC: Very vague, but thank you for that anyway.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Mike Baker at Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. A couple of questions on the Pro. Last quarter you talked about a private label credit card, sorry extending terms for the Pro customer I meant to say. Can you discuss how that's going? And then I think you had seen better items per basket for the pro customer which you saw as a positive sign, can you discuss trends there?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Yes. On the private label pilot that we have been conducting, it's in about 260 stores. This is where we're offering terms as well as fuel rewards points and we're very pleased with the results thus far and we anticipate making a go/no-go decision soon. Everything got pushed back a bit because of the data breach but we hope to make a decision soon. And on the Pro, I can just give one data point and that is just looking at what we know. We look at managed accounts as well as sales on our commercial private label card. Both managed accounts and sales on our commercial private label card make up over 20% of our total sales and in the first quarter, we saw growth outperforming the average company growth. So we were very pleased with the Pro in total.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Helpful, great. If I could ask another follow-up, I think last quarter you said you expect the first-quarter comp to be the best of the year, I think because of the easier comparisons. Is that still the case in your outlook?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Yes. We still expect the first quarter to be the best quarter and that the halves to be similar.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I'm going to sneak in one more if I could. Sorry, everyone. I know that in your Garden business you actually do have some winter products in there, like I think the ice pellets, the ice melting pellets and the like. So how much of that really strong growth in garden was due to winter product and how much is due to what I would refer to as true spring products?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It's largely true spring. We had a particularly tough start in the Northeast in February with cold and ice, and certainly we sold some ice melt, but really the warming trends in a much more normal spring across the whole country, it really was a true Garden story.\nMichael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Seth Sigman at Credit Suisse.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thanks very much. A question on the expense productivity. So, Carol, I think you said SG&A now expected to grow at 35% of sales growth, a little bit less than you had talked about previously despite what seemed like a couple of incremental costs in the first quarter. Can you talk about were some of the savings are coming from? And then related I think you said that the expense growth factor would be higher in the first half. What's the right way to be thinking about that as we move through this year?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Yes. So nothing has really changed on the expense front, and as we called out, we had higher expenses in the first quarter than our plan. Why the expense growth factor is declining from our original guidance is all a factor of sales. We had a considerable beat to our plan in the first quarter and we're rolling that forward for the full year. And this company defines operating leverage. So the more sales you get, the more leverage that you get. So it's just a function of our new sales outlook. And in terms of the expense growth factor broken down by half, we would expect the expense growth factor to be higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. And then just a specific category question. Related to the Flooring business obviously there has been a lot of noise in that category. What are you guys hearing from consumers? And are you making any changes to your assortment? And I guess just in general I know you have a number of different tests going on, maybe you could just speak about the performance and what you are seeing that would be helpful?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I would start with just a comment that we're really not hearing much from consumers at all, and I can let Ted explain growth in categories.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Yeah, so there's certainly a lot of noise, nothing that we've been able to quantify in an impact in our business. Flooring did comp below the company average, but we're seeing nice trends there and Tile is really the story for us. Tile continues to perform very well. We did 600-odd stores where we put in the expanded hard set showroom, which is really about getting a lot more tile displayed and available for sale in bulk, and that continues to perform very well. It's all of the space optimization play to move in the Flooring categories where trends are seeing more in hard surface, than carpet. We'll continue to look for those opportunities. We've been pleased with the results of those 600-odd stores.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Morning.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Congrats on a nice quarter.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): A couple of questions. First off, with respect to buybacks, it looks with the stock you bought back here in Q1 and then the guidance it seems like you're basically tracking along with your plan. But as we think about the balance of the year is there any reason to believe or any shift in thinking with regard to taking on extra debt to buy back additional shares?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Brian, our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio stands a little under 1.8 times, and you know our target is not to exceed 2 times. So we have the capacity right now to borrow about $3 billion to take us back up to target. It is not our intention to let our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio decline as it will with more earnings. It's not our intention to let it decline. And as you've seen us act in the prior couple of years, we've taken advantage of market opportunities to bring in some incremental debt and use that for share repurchases. So nothing to announce today, but it certainly is not our intention to let the ratio decline.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And our board has authorized an $18 billion buyback program through 2017.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And that's very helpful. My follow-up question I guess I will bounce this one, looking to your market model, and I think you guys do a very good job of kind of framing how Home Depot's business is tracking along the lines of the macro economy, but what we've seen lately is I think improving housing turn even with some of the data we got this morning. As you look at your business and the drivers behind that business, are you starting to see a benefit of maybe a modestly more robust sales environment for homes helping Home Depot?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I mean, certainly the housing trends that we see in the market are positive, and as Carol called out, in some cases above our assumptions overall. It's certainly when home values go up, it gives customer confidence to drive into the project business, and when we see home turnover, that generally drives activity as well.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Right. And so home price appreciation is a big driver. Home prices are up 5% year-over-year. That's higher than our plan. The other driver is household formation, and it looks like there'll be 1 million households formed this year, which should be awesome. In fact I'm always fascinated by this statistic. If you look at people between the ages 18 and 34, nearly a third of them are at home with their parents. And if they were all to leave their home nest, like my nephew just did, thank goodness, that's 4 million households that would be created. So I'm just really excited about what the future may be for our business.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.\nBrian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jaime Katz at Morningstar.\nJaime M. Katz - Morningstar Research: Good morning. Last quarter you guys commented on using merchandise planning tools to improve a number of different categories across the store. I'm curious if there were any incremental lessons learned about how to improve the operating margin line across the board?\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: I think that one of the principal lessons we're learning is that you're never done on the journey of continuing to optimize your assortments in your space. We used to have resets in PLRs and line reviews as an event. It would be every one year, every two years, every three years, and then you wouldn't pay particularly as much attention to that category. What we're doing now is building the tools that you can have a much more fluid review process, and constantly be optimizing your assortments. And that notion of never really being done and building tools that are flexible enough and easy enough to use to have a continuous productivity and improvement loop, is one of the key things on discovering.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And the most important piece of that is, that starts with sales. It's all about driving the productivity in sales, which then delivers the gross margin dollars.\nJaime M. Katz - Morningstar Research: Okay. And then do you have any additional commentary on the tightness in credit availability? I think last quarter you commented that it was still very tight. Has there been any movement in the data that you guys have seen?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: There's slight movement. It seems to be thawing slowly like a glacier melt, but slowly. Interestingly, the number of mortgages that are being underwritten by FHA, these are insured mortgages, is up year-on-year. That's actually pretty encouraging, because it means first-time home builders are finding \u2013 or homeowners, excuse me \u2013 are finding a way to get into a home. But this is, this is slow.\nJaime M. Katz - Morningstar Research: Okay. Thank you.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Dan Binder at Jefferies.\nDaniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning. It's Dan Binder.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nDaniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC: I had a few questions. I know you've commented on your gross margin outlook for the year. Just longer term before the reclassification you had a 35% longer-term gross margin outlook. Has that changed as a result? Are we looking now at something closer to this 34.1% or 34.2% with the reclassification?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Dan, we would say 34% is the new 35%. Now, we do have an Investor Conference coming up at the end of this year, and we'll give you a longer-term outlook on all of our margins.\nDaniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And my second question was on the Pro. You, just in prior conversations, you've talked about different initiatives there. I'm just curious where we are on the scheduling systems I think you wanted to put in place to improve on the delivery windows.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. On the delivery, we are still in pilot on that delivery program, and it is about being able to more consistently drive delivery and narrow our windows as well as better utilization of our assets. And Mark Holifield is here, I don't know if you want to make an additional comment.\nMark Holifield - Executive VP-Supply Chain & Product Development: Yeah, we've got the program in pilot in a couple of markets, and we're learning how this works and working through the details so that we can provide the customer a flawless experience. We're offering two-hour windows, four-hour windows, and then next day that are just all-day delivery windows. The pilot is going well. We're taking the learnings and continuing to improve the process.\nDaniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC: And then just lastly on the deflation, you mentioned a little bit here in Q1, is there an expectation that will increase in Q2 in terms of the pressure on the comp?\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Well, we're not forecasting an improvement against commodities, copper prices and lumber prices are down meaningfully on next year and we're anticipating it staying as is.\nDaniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Matthew Fassler at Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot, and good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: My first question actually relates to the accounting change. If you think about the SG&A that you had previously or the expenses you had previously allocated to SG&A, those numbers were growing with your online sales which were growing at a pretty rapid pace. And if you look at the numbers in 2014 versus 2013 for example, it seemed to be a decent piece of your SG&A growth. So is the accounting change influencing the ratio of expense dollar growth to sales dollar growth that you're thinking about either for this year or on a go-forward basis?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Matt, it is not. When we put forward guidance at the beginning of the year, I looked at it both pre what we call COGS alignment and post COGS alignment, just to make sure I wasn't going to give you some distortion on the guidance. It has no impact at all.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you. And then you mentioned the port situation and clearly you put up very good numbers despite some pressure from it. Can you talk about the categories where you think you saw impact and if it's feasible or material to quantify what it might have done to your inventory numbers, your in-stock, your sales, et cetera? Any quantification would be very helpful.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Mark do you want to?\nMark Holifield - Executive VP-Supply Chain & Product Development: Sure. Yeah, Matt, as we mentioned last quarter, the West Coast ports have been a very challenging situation for us. The team here has done a great job in terms of working together to mitigate the issues there. Having said that, we have had negative impact on our in-stock, particularly for our direct import items, but we've also seen some hits to our fill rates from vendors, and that has led to lower in-stock than we would like to see. So our inventory probably is a little lower than we would like it to be given where it's at, but that inventory is coming and it's recovering as the port has gotten a lot better.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Do you want me to quantify this for you. The impact to in-stocks was about 20 basis points.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's it. Got it.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: And it's very hard to measure sales impact because what our store associates do and they do a beautiful job of this. If you come into the store and you can't find what you're looking for, our store associate is going to take you to something out there.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Our best thinking is $60 million-ish.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you so much, guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli at RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning, guys. So the first quarter continues a trend that we've seen in terms of a lot of sales breadth across categories and geographies. I guess what I'm wondering is of the 7% of the stores that did not qualify for Success Sharing or profit-sharing is there any common denominator there whether it's geography or pro or DIY mix or something you can put your finger on?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It's weather. Plain and simple. If you look at the areas in New England very, very late start to the spring selling season.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got you. Okay. And then the second question related to the geography is we have started to hear some sporadic data points from various retailers in terms of some weakness where they are operating in energy impacted markets. Have you seen that play through whether it's in some of the Texas markets or the Midwestern markets where obviously there's been a big oil patch retraction?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We have 178 stores in the State of Texas. We've seen no visible impact whatsoever in that State at this point. Matter of fact all our major markets in that State posted mid-single-digit comps. It's something that we're keeping our eyes on very closely and we'll adjust accordingly if need be, but have not seen it at this point.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Excellent. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Dennis McGill at Zelman & Associates.\nDennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates: Hi. Good morning. Thanks.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nDennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates: Carol just a quick one on the guidance. Can you just tell us what you're assuming for the domestic side on same-store sales for the year?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: We don't breakout comp guidance by U.S. versus total. So, No.\nDennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates: Okay. Separately on the inventory side it seems when you adjust for FX the turns are very strong quarter-over-quarter. Can you maybe just talk to where you are in the process of taking inventory out of channel and where you expect the cash flow and the inventory management to be this year?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Yes. We want to do this the right way. We don't want to do it by going out of stock. This year, in fact, our targeted turns are 4.8 times. You'll recall two years ago we thought we'd get to five times by the end of this year. We're not going to get there, because we want to do it the right way. The good news is that we've got a number of initiatives underway that once they are fully employed I think the five times turn will be something considerably higher. Now that won't be in 2015, but there's more to come on the inventory story at The Home Depot.\nDennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates: And can you put any context around where you are seeing the best management today as far as categories go?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: On inventory?\nDennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates: Yeah.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You mean on the inventory turns within categories?\nDennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates: Yeah, just on the management side, are there certain categories where you are seeing more opportunity than others?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think when we actually go through our product line review process, this is something that we incorporate into those reviews. So the merchants are looking at not only how they can drive more top line sales and productivity out of the product categories as well, but they're looking at how they optimize inventory productivity and first and foremost in-stock within that. So we've seen improvement in categories that we've actually run through our model.\nDennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Greg Melich at Evercore ISI.\nGregory Scott Melich - Evercore ISI: Hi. Thanks. Actually I have a couple of questions. The ticket decelerated, it seems, to 1.7% growth. Was that a U.S. or a global figure? And help us understand the deceleration, especially given the success of the March ticket.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: The ticket we called out was a total company ticket. FX impacted ticket by $0.58 year-on-year, so that's a pretty big drag.\nGregory Scott Melich - Evercore ISI: So the U.S. ticket would've been 2%, 3%?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Yes.\nGregory Scott Melich - Evercore ISI: And then even in that U.S. there seemed to be a deceleration. Was there something working behind that mix of products?\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: It's the impact of our garden business being more normal than what it was a year ago.\nGregory Scott Melich - Evercore ISI: Okay, that makes sense. And then my follow-up was I guess a little bit bigger picture. I think in the prepared comments you guys mentioned that you had the most transactions ever in the first quarter. And I guess if you think about that longer term do you think you need to add capacity in any way, maybe not footage but more fulfillment centers? How do you think about that, Craig, longer-term in terms of allocating capital and being able to serve all of the customers?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We're not \u2013 in most cases we're still operating a single shift, if you will, through our distribution network. So we have the ability to add a lot of capacity through the asset base we own.\nMark Holifield - Executive VP-Supply Chain & Product Development: Yeah. It's Mark Holifield here. We don't have any development plans right now on further distribution centers for the core side of the business. We have been of course improving our direct fulfillment capabilities and we will be bringing on the new direct fulfillment center in Troy, Ohio in the second part of this year.\nGregory Scott Melich - Evercore ISI: Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Jessica Mace at Nomura Securities.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: I had a follow-up question on the market model, and just on the above plan sales with below consensus GDP. I was wondering if there's anything you can point to outside of the better housing metric and the weather that accounted for the bridge to that performance perhaps in the competitive environment or market share shift?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Well, it's very difficult for us to get a good measure on market share, but if you look at the census data, which is a good proxy for it, census data showed us growing our market share somewhere around 10 basis points to over 27%.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, great. And then also with the strong sales result, I think last quarter you mentioned that there were 16 of your 40 categories which were still below peak and just wondering if this strong top-line momentum has taken any of those 16 categories out of the below peak status.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Not yet.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Not yet.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Working on it.\nJessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: All right. Thank you so much for taking the questions.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Thank you.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.\nOperator: We'll go next to Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray.\nPeter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey. Thank you very much. Good quarter. Kind of a follow-up to Jessica's question, I'm just wondering about the overall retail wallet share shift that seems to be occurring. Obviously home price appreciation helped, but you guys are comping high single-digit in $900 lowered water heaters. I guess I'm wondering if you have a view on why the consumer is deallocating so much money to your industry relative to other parts of retail right now?\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I would say that's a tough one to call out. There is the theory of the case that in some cases there was a delayed spend. Clearly during the economic downturn and people focused strictly on maintenance of their homes. If you recall our maintenance categories were strong throughout the economic downturn. And when a home moves to a positive growth in terms of value, what was once an expense now becomes potentially an investment.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: It's pretty easy, if you look at your own personal balance sheet. It's easy to put a value on your home. It's easy to put a value on your stock investments or your bond investments or even just the cash that you have in the bank account. Harder to put value on softgoods. Harder to put value on other consumables. So that could be one reason if you think about wealth creation putting money into where you want to create wealth.\nPeter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay, well, that's helpful. And I guess lastly or maybe on a related note, I'm curious on the use of HELOCs, if you guys are seeing any evidence that there's more borrowing with HELOCs and in turn coming into your stores?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: We're not current on the HELOC activity. Can't help you there.\nPeter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Good enough. Thank you very much.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services: Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff - Vice President-Investor Relations: Audra, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And we'll take that question from Eric Bosshard at Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: I was curious for Ted or Craig, as you think about mix and promotion and brand, what trends you are seeing and what you are doing either proactively or reactively in those areas in merchandising.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Eric, I'm sorry. I didn't catch the first comment.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Sure. Within product mix and with promotional activity and with brand.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: Well, I don't think the general promotional activity in the marketplace in the first quarter I'd say was similar. We didn't really change our cadence. What we did and the events we did with things like the Spring Black Friday. On mix we've seen the consumers, we've talked about this before, where we track all sales by various price points and we saw yet another quarter of where the consumer is buying up the continuum. And we are seeing higher comps in each price gradient as you go up the mix from OPP to good or best premium products. On brands the consumer always is looking for value, the right product at the retail and I think we have a great mix of the right brands and our own private label product as well to satisfy that customer.\nCraig A. Menear - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I'd like to say one other comment as it relates to the mix is with much of the country seeing a much more normal kind of spring, obviously just outdoor projects in general were stronger in the first quarter than they were a year ago.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. And then within brands and the strategy on private label I know historically you've been \u2013 sell the customer what they want. But is there anything that you're seeing different within there from the consumer or anything that you intentionally are focused on in regards to the private label or direct import penetration relative to national brands?\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: No, we haven't. We still don't have a specific target on a private label penetration. We're over 15% and again we're letting the consumer choose the value proposition they want.\nEric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.\nEdward P. Decker - Executive Vice President-Merchandising: All right.\nDiane Dayhoff - Vice President-Investor Relations: Well thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you at our next quarterly earnings call.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference.

Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2016 was a record year for our business, as we achieved the highest sales and net earnings in company history. Fiscal 2016 sales grew $6.1 billion to $94.6 billion, an increase of 6.9% from fiscal 2015, while diluted earnings per share grew 18.1% to $6.45. Sales for the fourth quarter were $22.2 billion, up 5.8% from last year. Comp sales were up 5.8% from last year, and our U.S. stores had positive comps of 6.3%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.44 in the fourth quarter. We continue to see broad-based growth across the store and our geographies. All three of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps in the fourth quarter, as did all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets. Internationally, both our Mexican and Canadian businesses posted positive comps in local currency for the quarter, making it 53 and 21 quarters in a row of positive comps, respectively. Our merchants and store teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service for our customers across multiple events throughout the quarter, both in stores and online. As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter, and all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. We saw healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories, with Pro sales outpacing DIY sales in the quarter. A portion of our overall Pro strategy is focused on the integration of the underlying business, which continues to progress. We are pleased with the traction that we are seeing, as we have successfully completed work on the first business use case. The roll-out of Interline's catalog of products is now taking place across all U.S. Home Depot stores. The next phase of the integration is focused on enabling Interline's customers to use their Interline accounts for purchases in Home Depot stores or on homedepot.com. We're excited about the opportunity Interline provides us to expand our share of wallet with Pro customers. Our interconnected business made great strides in 2016. The team substantially completed the HD.com redesign with enhanced features for better search and faster checkout, upgraded the mobile app, and introduced a dynamic estimated time of arrival feature to provide customers a faster and more accurate delivery date based on location. We measure the success of these changes by the increased traffic and conversion rates that we have seen across our interconnected platforms, as well as improved customer service scores. For the year, our online business grew over 19% versus the prior year, and now represents 5.9% of our total sales. While we are seeing significant growth in our online business, our stores have never been more relevant, as about 45% of our online U.S. orders are picked up in our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. As you know, our interconnected business is much more than our online properties, as it seeks to blend the physical and digital world seamlessly to enable customers to shop with us whenever and however they choose. A key component of this strategy has been the investments that we've made to meet customers' demands for increased fulfillment options. This quarter, we completed the roll-out of BODFS, or Buy Online Deliver From Store. BODFS was built on the foundation of our new Customer Order Management system, or COM, which was fully deployed in all U.S. stores during the second quarter of 2016. We're pleased with the positive customer response to this enhanced delivery option, which streamlines the delivery experience for both our customers and our store associates. Our customer demands are changing, which means we must continue to simplify operations for our store associates. Our efforts to improve our freight-handling initiatives by connecting end-to-end are focused on creating one consistent process for every store that drives efficiency, removes waste, and optimizes product flow from truck to shelf. This quarter, we completed the roll-out of manual flow load for trucks from our RDCs to stores, which is a documented process for better utilization or cube-out of trucks en route to our stores. This process is standardized across all stores and has the benefits of reducing transportation costs by fully utilizing the capacity of each store-bound truck, as well as improving freight movement at the back of our stores as products are staged more efficiently for store associates. Turning to 2017, overall GDP growth and the strength in the U.S. housing market should continue to support growth in our business. As Carol will detail, we expect 2017 comp sales of approximately 4.6% and diluted earnings per share of $7.13. It was announced today that our board approved an increase in our targeted dividend payout ratio from 50% to 55%, and a 29% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.89 per share, which equates to $3.56 annually. The board also authorized a new share repurchase program of $15 billion. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create value for our shareholders. We will invest to sustain and grow our business and return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over the past two years, we grew our sales by over $11 billion. This was accomplished during a time when introduced a great deal of change into the business, not just in the U.S., but in Canada and Mexico as well. Projects like COM and BODFS, the acquisition of Interline, and our supply chain initiatives challenged our associates to adapt and learn to do old things in new ways. Our orange-blooded associates repeatedly rise to meet these new challenges head on, demonstrating the entrepreneurial spirit and passion for our customers that has made The Home Depot what it is today. I want to close by thanking these associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. For the second half of the year, 98% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. We look forward to continuing this momentum in 2017. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter, as sales exceeded our expectations. We saw strength across the store, led by our Pro customer, and our online business continued its double-digit growth, with sales growth of approximately 19% in the fourth quarter. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by Flooring and Tools, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. Lumber, Outdoor Garden, Appliances, Decor, Indoor Garden, Lighting and Plumbing were above the company's average comp. Hardware, Millwork, Electrical, Kitchen-Bath, Building Materials and Paint were all positive, but below the company average. We continue to see balanced growth between transactions and average ticket in the quarter. Total comp transactions increased 2.8%, while comp average ticket grew by 2.9%. Our average ticket increase was slightly impacted by commodity price inflation and foreign currency. Commodity price inflation positively impacted ticket growth by approximately 32 basis points, while a weaker Mexican peso negatively impacted ticket growth by approximately 45 basis points. Looking at big ticket sales in the fourth quarter, transactions over $900, which represent approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 11.6%. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were Flooring, Appliances, and several Pro categories. Once again, Pro sales grew faster than the company comp. We saw strong comps in Pro heavy categories like Fencing, Pressure-Treated Decking, Commercial and Industrial Lighting, Electrical Wiring, and Interior Doors. We also saw strength with our DIY customer, classes that outperformed included Special Order Carpet, Outdoor Power, Laminate Flooring and Storage. We drove record sales in each of our Black Friday, gift center and holiday programs. Our customers responded to our great values since traffic increased inside our stores and online, and we recorded our highest Cyber Week ever. Our events helped drive robust comps in Decorative Holiday, Tool Storage, Power Tools and Appliances. As part of our focus on balancing the art and science of retail, we continue to refine and localize our assortments. In our Outdoor Garden category, we are leveraging the power and agility of our local garden merchants. These merchants work directly with our stores and local growers to ensure we have the right mix of products to meet the demands of each individual community. As an example, during the drought in the West, our merchants sourced the highest-quality drought resistant live goods. As we look for to this spring, our local merchants are adjusting the assortment to meet current demand given much weather conditions. As customer preference continues to evolve and change, we will have local customized assortments so that the right product is always available. Now let's turn our attention to the first quarter. We are committed to being the product authority for home improvement. Product authority means having the best brands at great everyday values for our customers. With this, we are excited to introduce Milwaukee's new lineup of cordless outdoor power equipment. This lineup will include a string trimmer, blower, and hedge trimmer that are all part of the M18 platform of 125-plus tools. These professional-grade products have 18-volt power, a brushless motor, and come with a 9-amp power battery that delivers unmatched power and run time. These Milwaukee products are a Big Box exclusive. With spring rapidly approaching, we're gearing up for warmer weather in the outdoor project season. We are very excited about our new Patio Mix & Match offering where our customers are now able to fully customize their own patio set by mixing and matching different table, chair, cushion, and umbrella combinations to create their very own personalized set. We've seen a fantastic response from our customers with double-digit comps in the category. Our Spring Black Friday is also right around the corner, and we are excited for another successful event. To help our customers kick off the spring season right, we will be offering special buys on springtime products such as grills, outdoor power equipment, and live goods. We're looking forward to a great spring season. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, sales were $22.2 billion, a 5.8% increase from last year. Versus last year, foreign currency rates, primarily a weaker Mexican peso, negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $96 million or 0.5%. Our total company comps, or same-store sales, were positive 5.8% for the quarter with positive comps of 5.7% in November, 7.1% in December and 4.7% in January. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 6.3% for the quarter, with positive comps of 6% in November, 8% in December and 5.1% in January. For fiscal 2016, our sales increased 6.9% to $94.6 billion and total company comp sales were positive 5.6%. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 6.2%. During the year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales growth by approximately $549 million, or 0.6%. Our total company gross margin was 34% for the quarter, a decrease of 10 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors. First, we had 8 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity. Second, we had 15 basis points of gross margin contraction due to higher shrink than one year ago. And finally, we had approximately 3 basis points of gross margin contraction, due mainly to a change in the mix of products sold. For the year, we experienced 3 basis points of gross margin contraction. In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 113 basis points to 20.8%. Our expense leverage was driven principally by our strong sales performance and good expense control. Our total company expenses were $11 million higher than planned due to expenses associated with our 2014 payment data breach. With this, we now believe the majority of expenses associated with our payment data breach are behind us. Fiscal 2016 operating expense as a percent of sales was 20%, a decrease of 92 basis points from what we reported last year. For the year, our expenses grew at 30% of our sales growth rates. Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.2% and for the year was 14.2%. Reflecting favorable tax reserve adjustments, in the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 35.2% and for the year, our effective tax rate was 36.3%. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.44, an increase of 23.1% from last year. For the year, diluted earnings per share were $6.45, an increase of 18.1% compared to fiscal 2015. Now moving to some additional highlights, during the fiscal year, we opened four new stores in Mexico, bringing our total store count to 2,278 and selling square footage to 237 million square feet. For the year, total sales per square foot increased 5.5% to $391, our highest sales per square foot since 2001. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $12.5 billion, up $740 million from last year, and inventory turns were 4.9 times, flat with last year. Moving on to capital allocation, in fiscal 2016, we generated approximately $9.8 billion of cash from operations and used that cash, as well as proceeds from $2 billion of incremental long-term debt issuances, to invest in the business, repurchase our shares, and pay dividends to our shareholders. During the year, we invested approximately $1.62 billion back into the business through capital expenditures. Further, we repurchased approximately $7 billion, or about 53 million of our outstanding shares, including roughly $2.4 billion or 18 million shares in the fourth quarter. And finally, during the year, we paid $3.4 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 31.4%, 330 basis points higher than at the end of fiscal 2015. Now looking ahead, this morning we issued a press release with our guidance for fiscal 2017. And I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP, so our fiscal 2017 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2016. As we look to 2017, we remain encouraged by the strength of our core business and by what we are seeing in the housing environment. While private fixed residential investment as a percentage of GDP now stands at 3.8%, it has a way to go before it reaches the historical mean of 4.5%. Home price appreciation, housing turnover, and household formation continue to be tailwinds for our business. Using our directionally-correct but imperfect sales forecasting model, we are planning for fiscal 2017 sales to grow by approximately 4.6%. Sales growth at Interline and the opening of six new stores in 2017 will not materially change our overall growth rate. So our 2017 comp sales guidance is the same as our overall sales growth guidance. Now one last comment on our sales growth guidance. It is based on 2016 average U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates. If exchange rates remain where they are today, there is about $230 million of sales pressure to the guidance. For fiscal 2017, we are projecting our gross margin rate to decline by approximately 15 basis points from 2016, as we are planning for outpaced growth in lower-margin categories, such as Appliances and certain building material categories. On the expense front, we are forecasting our expenses to grow at approximately 49% of the rate of our sales growth, in line with the long-term guidance we provided to you in 2015. For the year, we expect that our operating margin will grow by approximately 30 basis points to 14.5%, reaching our fiscal 2018 target one year in advance of our goal. We will update our fiscal 2018 operating margin target at our Investor Conference scheduled for later in the year. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.3%. Starting with fiscal 2017, we are adopting FASB Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 for employee share-based compensation. Note that the estimated positive impact of this new accounting standard is reflected in our projected tax rate, but the actual impact won't be fully understood until equity grants are exercised throughout the year. We expect our fiscal 2017 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 10.5% to $7.13. Now as Craig mentioned in his remarks, in support of our commitment to return value to shareholders, our board just announced a new share repurchase authorization of $15 billion, replacing our existing authorization. Our earnings per share guidance includes our plan to replace approximately $5 billion of outstanding shares during the year using excess cash. For the year, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $11.3 billion. Our 2017 capital spending plan is approximately $2 billion. We will use this capital to support our strategic initiatives and invest in our aging store base to improve the customer experience. In addition to capital spending and share repurchases, we will use our cash to pay $4.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders. As Craig mentioned, our board just announced an increase in our targeted dividend payout ratio from what was 50% to now 55%. With that, we announced a 29% increase on our quarterly dividend, which equates to an annual dividend of $3.56. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to be evidenced by the investments we are making in our business and the cash return to shareholders. We thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Catherine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. Our first question will come from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, and congratulations on the results. My first question is on the \u2013 I guess, the balance between the same-store sales guidance and the gross margin guidance. How should we think about market share gains in that 4.6% versus the mix of product and/or, I don't know if it's promotion, but just maybe mix of product and maybe being more aggressive in the Appliance area?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, so I'll start, and I'll let Carol comment. When you look at the projected margin, as we've said, we're intending to lean into growth in categories that are lower-margin rate categories like Appliances, but also as our Pro business continues to grow with categories in Building Materials. And so that's really what we're looking at as it relates to the gross margin. And if you think about the last two years, gross margin has roughly been about 3 basis points. With the 15 basis points next year, that's about a 12 basis point decline, and we kind of consider that to be pretty flat.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: And maybe I'll just add a little color about our sales forecasting model. As you know, it starts with GDP growth forecasts, and for the U.S., GDP is projected to grow by 2.3% in 2017. We then add to that the benefits we believe we will get from rising home prices, housing turnover, and household formation. And we think housing will add another point-and-a-half growth to our overall growth next year. To that, we have added a little bit of share shift in Appliances and certain building categories. And just to put that in perspective, in 2016, Appliances contributed 50 basis points of our comp growth. So that gives you a sense of the share that we're including in our guidance. And then we're adding something else this year that we haven't included in the past, and that's what we call the cumulative wealth effect of home price appreciation. If you look at home equity, since 2011, home equity is up 108%. On average, that equates to $50,000 per household. And we believe that's contributing \u2013 as people use the equity of their house to spend back into their house, we believe that's contributing to our growth, so we factor that into our guidance, and that's how we got to the 4.6%.\nSimeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. My follow-up, on SG&A, I think the guidance suggests that the dollars grow I guess 49% relative to sales, and of course, Home Depot has had a strong bias to do better than its expense guidance over the years. As you look \u2013 as we look out to next year, is there anything in the mix that would prohibit or prevent you from maybe upside, is there anything more structural about the complexion of SG&A next year?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: So let me walk you through how we got to our guidance for 2017. As we commented, in 2016, our expenses grew at 30% of our sales growth rate. A bit of that was distorted because of payment data breach expenses that were incurred in 2015 and did not repeat in 2016. So if you ignore the payment data breach, our expenses in 2016 grew at about 38% \u2013 call it, 40% of our sales growth rate. It's stepping up to 50% in 2017 for a few reasons. We, like many companies, are facing rising wages, as well as higher medical costs, and we have factored that into our guidance. It doesn't mean that we won't drive productivity to offset some of that pressure like we have historically, but we have factored that into our guidance. Further, we're seeing some cost pressure coming in from property taxes in certain states like California, so we factored that into our guidance. And finally, because our capital spending is stepping up slightly year on year, there's a bit of expense associated with that. But as you know, productivity is a virtuous cycle at The Home Depot, so we always try to do better.\nSimeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: My first question is about Interline. I may have missed it, but what are you assuming for growth of that channel? And as you think about the integration, it sounds like the initial roll-out of the catalog, that's gone well in the early testing. Can you give us a sense of what you've seen; maybe a lift or just the change in behavior as you've added that catalog to the store? Thank you.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, I'll start with the growth assumptions and then we can talk about the performance. On the growth assumptions, we are assuming that Interline will grow faster than the company average in 2017, which was true in the fourth quarter as well. But remember, Interline is less than 2% of our total sales. So it just rounds out at the end of the day, and that's why our comp sales guidance is the same as our total sales guidance for 2017.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: And we are \u2013 we're excited about the opportunities with Interline. It is a $50 billion market opportunity across multi-family, hospitality and institutional, which we own about 5%, give or take, of that market. So it's a significant opportunity for us to continue our share of wallet with our Pro customer. And as you called out, we talked about the first use case is allowing our stores to purchase the Interline product. The next thing we're working on is allowing our Interline customers to be able to buy product through Home Depot or homedepot.com on their account. And that we're focused on here in 2017.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, you've discussed PFRI a lot over the years and the importance for your business. PFRI, it decelerated quite a bit in 2016, particularly towards the back half in year-over-year terms. Obviously, that disconnects with Home Depot's performance which accelerated. Do you think that's market share, maybe tying in one of the earlier questions, or do you think the mix of the business is changing in a way that's just \u2013 perhaps the underlying drivers of your business are changing a bit, too?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: I think PFRI is a great indicator of the health of the overall market. And as you can see, it is a healthy market. We are a big part of it, aren't we? Because improvements \u2013 if you look at the components of PFRI, improvements is one of the big components and we're part of improvements. So in a way, it's a bit circular. I'm not sure that it's a great predictive tool, but it certainly is a great indicator of the health. Now, here's a really fun fact \u2013 and I know you know this because you've done all the research in this area. If PFRI were to return to the mean of 4.5% and GDP remain the same, we'd have to grow about 18.5%. And assuming there's no share shift for The Home Depot, that's a $16 billion opportunity for us. So will we get all those sales? I don't know, but it certainly suggests as the housing market continues to recover, there's growth ahead for The Home Depot.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you for that.\nOperator: We'll continue on to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan Chase.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Good morning.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Question, on the cadence in the year, how are we thinking about comps? You just blew through what was supposed to be a very difficult comparison and didn't have any impact at all. How are you thinking about the spring set-up this year and then the overall cadence comps?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, as you know, we like to look at our business from a half and not a quarter because of what we call the bathtub effect. You're never really sure when spring will land. If we look at the split by half, we would expect the first half to be slightly lower than the back-half of the year. As you know, we're up against a tough comparison in the first quarter, particularly the month of February, where last year we had a U.S. comp of 11.8%. I will tell you, Chris, we planned for a positive comp in February. We are beating our plan. It's early in the quarter, of course, but we're feeling very good about our business.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's excellent. On the gross margin, does the outlook reflect any, I guess, slowing supply chain benefits or other pressures like ocean freight? And then related to that, inventories were flat in 2016. Should we see the expansion in 2017 with Project Sync?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: So on the gross margin, we certainly are seeing some pressure from fuel year-over-year, and Mark Holifield is here, can comment, but certainly, we expect to see some of that pressure in the year. But we will continue to get productivity through our supply chain, and then we'll invest that back into the business.\nMark Holifield - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, Craig, it's Mark Holifield here. On fuel, yes, fuel does look like it's firming up. We use the Department of Energy to base our plans. The forecast there is $2.72 against what it was in 2016, $2.31. And right now, we're at about $2.58. But that's incorporated in our guidance. In terms of the Sync and continued benefit, we do see continued benefit coming from that as we continue to synchronize the activities between our vendors, our carriers, our distribution centers, and our stores. We are looking into a firming transportation market a bit, but we do expect that we'll be able to offset those things with the benefits that we get from our initiatives.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: On the working capital front, we expect working capital to be a source of cash for the business in 2017, and we're planning for inventory turns to improve two-tenths year-on-year.\nChristopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. Have a great spring.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now hear from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks a lot for my \u2013 taking my question. Carol, can you describe the thought process behind recalibrating the model that you use to predict your sales outlook for the year by adding a component based on the wealth effect? Some of the skeptics might argue that anytime you have to recalibrate your model this far into a cycle, that might be a sign of the top, especially when perhaps one could argue you're double-counting the housing impact because you do have a housing component already and then if you add another, that weights (36:15) pricing.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, first of all, I will say it's a minor change; about four-tenths of growth year-on-year. Secondly, our forecasting model is directionally correct, but at the beginning of 2016, it certainly didn't predict a 6.2% comp in the United States. So we use all these factors to build a model to give us a sense of where we're going. There's another factor out there that we look at, but we haven't incorporated, but we're spending more time trying to understand, and that's the leading indicator of remodeling activity that's published by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. If you look at that, and I'm sure you have, you can see that it's suggesting growth rates higher than the guidance that we've provided. So no matter how we look at it, we're very confident with the sales forecast that we've given.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: That's helpful. And my other question is on your gross margin outlook for the upcoming year, and really your promotional posture. It seems like you're leaning in and taking advantage of some of the market share opportunities that are going to be afforded to you, but how do you balance between suppressing the profitability of the category and gaining your fair share? So you could lead in, be a little more aggressive on some of the promotions, but if that's what the customer is now conditioned to expect, you may never be able to get that profitability back, even if you did pick up some market share in the process.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: I think it's important to understand that the margin forecast that we're projecting is really much more around the mix of our business and what's growing in the mix of our business. Ted's here. He can comment. We're not looking to drive additional promotional activity, per se. This is all about, we continue to see categories like Appliances gain traction in the market. We continue to see our Pro customer engage in bigger projects and remodeling. Those carry lower rate businesses, but drive higher gross margin dollars, which is why we get the productivity on the operating margin line.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, Michael. This is Ted. I wouldn't say our share gains are coming on the back of promotional productivity. Appliances is certainly one category that is promotional, and we do participate in those promotions and have happily taken a lot of share. But the balance of the business, we have been very focused on everyday low pricing and bringing everyday low prices. As you know, we have a very strong Pro business, and you need to be priced right every day when the Pro comes into the store. So the market share gains are happening across the building, and that's the balance that we appreciate the most about it. And other than Appliances, we have not been leaning into promotions, albeit the marketplace in general has been a bit more promotional, that gives us more confidence to support our everyday low price positioning.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: One other data point, if I may. If you look at sales by category, peak to trough, while we've more than fully recovered everything we lost during the downturn, we haven't recovered every category. We still have $1.4 billion of sales that haven't fully recovered, and those are in low-margin categories. We want that to grow, and if housing continues to grow, it will.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go to Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.\nCody T. Ross - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi. This is Cody, actually, on for Scott today. Thanks for taking our question. Your Pro business continues to deliver exceptional performance. What is driving that performance? And can you update us on some of the initiatives you're running?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: I mean, Bill and Ted can comment on the Pro business.\nBill Lennie - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, we're \u2013 this is Bill Lennie. Just a comment on Pro activity. We're seeing a great balance between our low-spend and our high-spend Pro. Good health in the business being driven both by transactions, more transactions, and ticket. So it just says that we've got great activity in the stores. And, as Ted said, the drivers for the Pro are just in-stock and everyday value on the shelf. So it's just health across the business, across multiple categories.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, I...\nCody T. Ross - Wolfe Research LLC: Great. Yeah, let's (40:59) \u2013 continue.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Sure. This is Ted. The other thing that we continue to focus on is certainly being in-stock and having great value every day. We also strive to have the brands that the Pros want and the innovative product that we seek to deliver. And this happens throughout the store. For example, we're launching an even lighter drywall this quarter. It's 25% lighter, which helps the Pro complete their jobs and saves them time, and certainly a lot of backache. The Milwaukee outdoor power equipment, this is Pro runtime and power without the need of, obviously, messy fuels. So a lot of this is product and value that our merchants strive to bring every day for the Pro customer.\nCody T. Ross - Wolfe Research LLC: Great. Thank you. And many believe there's a lot of significant pent-up demand out there that will drive growth in housing in 2017 as you guys alluded to as well. However, rates are expected to rise. Is there a rate that you guys beginning to get worried? And how do you balance that pent-up demand versus the expected increase in rates? Thank you.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, our analysis would show that for every 25-basis point increase in mortgage rates, it costs the homeowner who's applied for a mortgage $40 more per month. So that helps sort of dimensionalize the pressure associated with rising rates. With the median home price in the country of $250,000, mortgage rates could go up to 7-ish percent before the Affordability Index would fall at 100 or below. So there's (42:45) a way to go before we'd be concerned. And you know what, mortgage rates stand today at 4.2%, 4.3%, something like that, the historical mean is 5.8%. So even if a return to the mean, you're still below that inflection point.\nCody T. Ross - Wolfe Research LLC: Understood. Thank you very much, and best of luck.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: Great, thank you. Just sticking with the Pro for a minute, I know you've highlighted product, value, credit, delivery. I'm just curious when you listen to the Pro, how much of the advantage do you have really lies with the store base, the density of the store base, the convenience of the store base in the markets?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: I mean, there's Pro business across all markets. We actually look at the penetration of our Pro business on a store-by-store basis. And this isn't tied to a specific market. It's a broad-based approach that we've taken in the business candidly from the very beginning of Home Depot.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: We joke, we are Pro.\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: And then in a quarter, I hate to even bring it up, but the shrinks was up a bit. I was just curious if there was anything that you would attribute to that.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: I wouldn't read anything to shrink for the year. Shrink was up 1 basis point. This is just a year-over-year comparison.\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: And then the last question, if I could. Given the strength in e-commerce, is there any implications on the profitability or profit headwind as the e-commerce business grows within the broader mix of the sales?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, as we have shared in the past, we actually think about this as one business, that's the way the customer thinks about it. And so we handle this from a portfolio approach, and we look at a blended operation, because that's really where the customer is taking us with 45% of our orders being picked up in-store.\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We will continue to Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thank you.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Good morning.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC: Curious if you could elaborate a little bit on the Flooring category. It's been an area I think just in general in home improvement that hasn't been very robust even within your relative performance and to see that as a double-digit category, hoping you can maybe explain a little bit what was driving that.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Sure. You've heard us talk over the last several quarters about our investments in hard surface materials. And those businesses continue to do very well with laminate very strong. We're getting great product innovation on vinyl flooring. So today's vinyl flooring is not the 1950s and 1960s kitchens laminate in \u2013 or vinyl, rather. And so you're starting to see what's called Luxury Vinyl Plank introduced into many use cases. Tile continues to perform very well. But the thing that is really working for us right now is the soft side. You haven't heard us talk about the soft side in some time; our hard set has been doing great for several quarters. And we're now seeing the soft side pick up very significantly. So we have both ends of that business working for us right now, which is what produced the double-digit comps.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC: And that acceleration, Ted, from third quarter to fourth quarter was on the soft side, and was there any type of promotion or installed promotion-driven \u2013 driving that?\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: No. No promotion at all.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC: Okay. And then, Carol, on the capital spending plan of $2 billion, in the grand scheme of things, I guess it's not that much, but up from $1.6 billion in 2016. How much of that is definitely coming through versus things that might be planned and could potentially be pushed out? And just wanted to make sure that's the right comparison, the $2.0 billion to the $1.6 billion.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: The comparison is correct. We are planning to spend the capital that we are guiding to of $2 billion. It's about 2% of sales. And as you think about capital for our business going forward, if you want to model 2% of sales, I think that would be a good number to use. We're investing in the initiatives that we've shared with you, be it interconnected retail, supply chain; we are also investing into our stores. As Craig pointed out, 45% of our online orders are picked up inside of our stores, that means we need to do some reconfiguration to hold those orders, and make sure the experience is right. We did a lot of work with our customers this summer and got some good feedback from our customers about things we could do differently in our stores. So 500 of our stores will be receiving what we call a new store environment, (47:43) lighting, the floors are going to be polished up. The stores are relevant, we want to keep them that.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And, Carol, you mentioned the breach cost I think in the fourth quarter, is that right? And so do you have a number?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: It's $11 million in the quarter, $37 million for the year, $298 million life to date, and I think we're done. We're happy about that.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC: Okay, appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks so much. Sorry. Thanks so much, and good morning. Can you guys hear me?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Good morning. Yes.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yes.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. My first question relates to capital allocation. We obviously took note of both the dividend hike and the change in the payout ratio, as well as the new buyback authorization. Over the past couple of years, you've bought back more stock than you had initially guided to. Can you talk about whether the higher payout ratio would change your ability or your inclination to do so, I guess if the price was right, of course? And also just remind us of the leverage targets that you're thinking about.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: I think we've guided at the beginning of each year based on the cash flow projections that we have for the business. We still have a target of 2 times debt to EBITDAR ratio that is something that our board is comfortable with, so it's possible that we could expand.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, if you look at where the adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio stands today, there's $2 billion of borrowing availability. It's not our intent to let that ratio decline, which it will if we don't lever back up. The interest rate environment is still very attractive. We're very pleased with how we've utilized debt financing to supplement our cash to buy back our share. So certainly not suggesting that anything is going to change off of our past practice.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then \u2013 thank you for that. And then my second question, my second question \u2013 thank you for that. My second question relates to big ticket in the fourth quarter. So this was the third straight year that your big ticket comp was strongest in Q4, and obviously you've been putting up amazing multiyear comps in aggregate in Q4, but big ticket seems to be the biggest driver. If you would talk about either changes in your selling push or in buying patterns, is it better traction in Appliances? Is it the Pro push in Q4? Is it marketing across a broad array of seasons? What is it that is driving your transactions over $900 to such a great degree in Q4 more so than over the rest of the year?\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Sure, Matt. I'd say, first of all, that what we really like in the business is the balance. So, as Carol and Craig said, our comp in the U.S. stores was 6.3% in Q4; it was 6.2% for the year. We have an even balance of ticket and transactions. In the fourth quarter, it was roughly 3% for each of ticket and transaction. We're getting growth in our small ticket. We're getting the growth that you're asking about in big ticket, and we're also seeing an increase in items per basket. So just that breadth of performance across the store we like very much. What's driving the outsize gains for another quarter in big ticket is really, you named them, so we continue to drive the Appliance business in the fourth quarter. Appliance has become a big selling period, but traditionally, the Black Friday period in retail. Our Flooring business that I talked about helped drive that ticket. And then the broad strength of the Pro across the entire store is the third large element driving that outsize comp in big ticket.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thank you so much, Ted. Appreciate it.\nDiane Dayhoff - The Home Depot, Inc.: Catherine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot, and good morning.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Good morning.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: My question is around SG&A, specifically labor optimization. You mentioned this in the past as a potential initiative for 2017. If you can provide update on how you are thinking about it now that would be helpful.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah. And when it comes to optimizing, we're looking at that across multiple aspects of our business. We on occasion look at the structure within our business and we have organizational changes. This past year, for example, we brought together our online and marketing teams because that's really the direction of where the business is going. So we're continually looking at how do we optimize and drive productivity within our business around the SG&A.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: And certainly, Craig, you commented on what we're doing with freight inside the store.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yes. And this is an area that in 2016 really is the first year that we've begun to focus on freight handling inside our stores. It's an area of opportunity for us as we continue to leverage the work that we've begun with supply chain Sync, but really optimize how we flow product inside the stores. I've talked about in the past that what we'll ultimately have to get to in our stores is handling product inside the buildings as efficiently as we do in our DCs.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. So as you look at the forecast for SG&A growth in 2017, does it contemplate much in the way of labor productivity savings?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: No material change to what you've seen in the past several years.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: All right. Thank you so much.\nDiane Dayhoff - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you on our first quarter earnings call in May.\nOperator: Thank you.

Now before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter for both sales and earnings, as we continue to see strength across our business. Sales for the third quarter were 23.2 billion, up 6.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 5.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 in the third quarter, up 18.5% versus last year. In the U.S., all three of our divisions posted positive comps in the third quarter led by our Southern division. All our regions positively comped except one region in the North. In New England, we had a small negative comp due primarily to a state sales tax holiday in fiscal 2015 that did not repeat in 2016. Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico and Canada reported positive comps in local currency marking 52 and 20 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth, respectively. As Ted will detail, we saw balanced growth from both ticket and transactions. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps and we saw healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY customers, with Pro sales growing faster than DIY sales in the quarter. Our Pro business continues to be driven by a strong offering of brands that Pros demand consistent product innovation, as well as enhanced delivery and credit offerings to help them more efficiently manage their business. In the third quarter, we anniversaried the acquisition of Interline and are proud of the team's efforts in the first year. The Interline integration continues to progress as we work to execute against the business use cases to leverage Interline's capabilities. We're excited about the opportunity Interline provides us to expand our share of wallet with customers. We continue to see double-digit sales growth from our online business. This quarter, online sales grew over 17% and represented 5.6% of overall sales. Over 40% of our online orders are picked up in the store which we view is a positive sign of our physical stores continued relevance with our customers. This quarter, we rolled out a complete homedepot.com redesign. Content was enhanced to display in full screen optimizing our desktop and tablet displays for customers. You will recall during last year's third quarter, we opened and began shipping from our third direct fulfillment center or DFC in the U.S. With this distribution infrastructure in place, we have been better able to serve the needs of our online customers faster and more directly. We are still assorting the appropriate products to house in our three DFC's but we\u2019ve been able to reduce delivery costs and improve overall customer experience. We continue to invest in our supply chain transformation by optimizing our network through initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. This quarter, we began the rollout of Sync to our Northern division and we continue to onboard new suppliers in the Southern and Western divisions. As you know, this is a multiyear, multi-phased endeavor but we are pleased with our progress thus far. Changing customer expectations are requiring that we simplify our operations in order to improve productivity and at the same time reinvest in the customer experience. Our efforts to drive operational excellence and freight handling in the stores are doing just that. Reducing both time and footsteps needed to move freight end-to-end or from truck-to-shelf will enable us to reallocate associate time to enhance the customer experience. One way we\u2019re reinvesting in the customer experience is through initiatives like COMS and BODFS. As you will recall, COMS is our new customer order management system that was fully deployed last quarter in all U.S. stores. And BODFS or Buy Online, Deliver From Store remains on track to be rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. In the 1,600 plus stores where we have BODFS, our on-time delivery service is now exceeding our target and we have seen double-digit increase in the number of deliveries. We\u2019re pleased with the positive customer response to this enhanced delivery option. Turning to the macro environment, we believe home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the aging housing stock in the U.S. continue to support growth in our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales growth and lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year. Let me close by thanking our 400,000 plus associates for their hard work, dedication and commitment to our customers. I\u2019d like to give a special thanks to all the associates and suppliers who have worked to help the communities impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. They have worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances, often in the face of disruption in their own lives caused by these storms. Service to our communities is a core part of The Home Depot culture and we're very proud of their efforts. With that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with our results in the third quarter. We saw strength across the store, balanced between Pro and DIY customers as well as continued growth in our online business. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps led by appliances which had double-digit comps in the quarter. Lumber, tools, outdoor garden, indoor garden, lighting, d\u00e9cor and flooring were above the company's average comp. Plumbing, hardware, building materials, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical and paint were positive but below the company average. We continue to see balanced growth between transactions and average ticket in the quarter. Total comp transactions increased to 2.4% while comp average ticket grew 3.1%. Our average ticket increase was slightly impacted by commodity price inflation, mainly from lumber and building materials. The total impact to ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 35 basis points. In addition, our average ticket growth was negatively impacted by approximately 33 basis points primarily due to a weaker Mexican peso. Looking at big ticket sales in the third quarter, transactions over $900, which represent approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 11.3%. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were appliances, flooring and roofing. Once again, we saw strong outperformance in many Pro heavy categories as Pro sales grew faster than the company's average comp. This led the strong comps in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, plywood, pressure-treated decking and interior doors. At the same time, we also saw strength with the DIY customer as they undertook various projects around the house. This project business drove strong comps in special order carpet, tool storage, laminate flooring and vanities. Weather remained favorable throughout the quarter and extended the outdoor project selling season. By leveraging forecast analytics, strong supplier collaboration and our flexible supply chain, we were able to meet customer demand throughout the prolonged selling season. Categories such as lawnmowers, seed, planters, fertilizers and soils and mulch posted comps above the company average. As Craig mentioned, our vendor partners, supply chain and internal teams rallied to support our customers impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. Through strong collaboration we were able to get product to our communities in their time of need. We estimate the impact of storm-related sales in the quarter to be approximately $100 million. During the quarter, we held our annual Halloween, Harvest and Labor Day events. These events were a huge success and increased both foot traffic in our stores and volume online. We experienced robust comps in decorative holiday, appliances and power tools. Turning to our interconnected business, we made significant changes for online experiences in the third quarter. We rolled out an updated HD.com site and redesigned our app, both without interruption. The update includes an expanded buy box which now makes it easier for our customers to select their preferred fulfillment option at checkout whether that be delivered to home or picked up in store. These changes have already yielded positive results as we have seen improvements in overall site performance. Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Product innovation remains a key part of our strategy. Adding to our broad lineup of professional grade power tools, we were excited to introduce two new breakthroughs. From Milwaukee, we are launching a 9 amp-hour lithium battery. This battery pack delivers up to five times the runtime, 35% more power and runs 60% cooler than standard lithium battery packs, saving customers valuable time and money. The new battery is fully compatible with more than 100 Milwaukee M18 tools and provides the next big step toward complete corded replacement. This new and advanced battery is a big-box exclusive to The Home Depot. From Makita, we\u2019re excited to announce the new Sub-Compact Drill and Impact Driver. These revolutionary new tools are the smallest Pro tools in the market delivering 18-volt power. The electronically controlled brushless motor in these products enables them to run cooler and more efficiently while at the same time matching the torque and RPMs needed to meet the demands of the Pro customer. These products are another big-box exclusive to The Home Depot. The winter season and cooler temperatures are rapidly approaching and we have a great lineup of excellent values and special buys for our customers during our Black Friday Holiday and gift center events. One product to look for this holiday season is the exciting new Star Shower Motion Laser Light. This new and improved laser light projector not only projects thousands of green and red stars for festive display in front of the home but it also turns into a motion laser light show at a press of a button. This product is a channel exclusive to The Home Depot. Our upcoming events, new product launches and outstanding execution by our associates will help drive a great holiday season. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Ted, and hello everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $23.2 billion, a 6.1% increase from last year driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline brands versus last year foreign currency rates, primarily a weaker Mexican peso, negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $76 million or 0.35%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 5.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.8% in August, 6.5% in September and 6.1% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.9% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.2% in August, 6.9% in September and 6.5% in October. One last comment on comps. While we are on a path to fully integrate Interline brands, we aren\u2019t at a point where it makes sense to include its results in our comps and operational sell metrics. When the business becomes more integrated, we will include Interline's results in our operational metrics. Our total company gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 6 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors. First, as expected, we had 24 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain driven primarily by increased productivity. And finally, we had 17 basis points of gross margin expansion arising from a change in the mix of products sold and improvement in inventory shrinkage. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 62 basis points to 20.4%. In the quarter, we had some expenses that we did not plan for; including $23 million of legal expenses related to our 2014 data breach and approximately $15 million of storm-related cleanup expenses. Even with this unplanned expense pressure, we delivered total expenses under our plan. For the year, we expect our expenses to grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, an increase of 68 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $236 million, down $4 million from last year. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.2% compared to 37.1% last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to approximately 36.7%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.60, an increase of 18.5% from last year. Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, merchandised inventories were $13.2 billion, up $746 million from last year. Inventory turns were 5 times, flat with the third quarter of last year. Year-over-year accounts payable grew slightly faster than inventory increasing by $818 million to $8.1 billion. In the third quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion or approximately 16.4 million shares of outstanding stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to approximately $4.6 billion. Additionally, during the quarter we took advantage of an attractive interest rate environment and raised $2 billion of incremental long-term debt, including $1 billion tranche with a record setting 40-year maturity carrying a coupon of 3.5%. We will use the proceeds of this debt issuance to repurchase outstanding shares bringing our targeted fiscal 2016 share repurchases to $7 billion. Accordingly, we expect to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 29.1%, 280 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Moving to our guidance. We remain encouraged by the strength of our core business. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects modest GDP growth, continued benefits from U.S. housing markets and candidly the market share gains. While we have tough fourth quarter comparisons, as Ted described, we plan for them. Today, we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Note that our sales forecast assumes foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal third quarter. For earnings per share, we\u2019ve tightened up our tax provision and outstanding share forecast and are lifting our guidance. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.9% to $6.33. So thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. Catherine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll hear first from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Craig, the question here is how do you comp the comp in the fourth quarter and the first quarter given the very cooperative weather conditions that you saw last year? I know you briefly touched on that but maybe you can provide a little bit more detail? Plus what are you looking for to ensure that you don\u2019t misread the state of a cycle and either respond too quickly or too slowly to potentially changing market conditions?\nCraig Menear: So on how do we comp the comp, I\u2019ll recall this was the conversation we had going into fiscal 2016 coming out of last year. Quite honestly, that\u2019s the hard work that the team does immediately following the performance that we had last year in the fourth quarter. We are up against big numbers. U.S. comp in the fourth quarter last year was 8.9%. But that\u2019s really the work the team started doing immediately following the close of that quarter. So we feel confident in the programs that merchant teams have laid out, the support with the supply chain teams and then of course our store associates taking those programs and driving them. Quite honestly that\u2019s our job. That\u2019s what we need to do.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And if I could just jump in, it\u2019s Carol here. So we are in the middle of November and we are on track to deliver the sales that we just guided to.\nCraig Menear: And then in terms of what you look at so that we don\u2019t miss anything, we\u2019ve shared in the past I think that we\u2019re constantly watching ticket and transaction and when you step away from the downturn in the mid-2000s, the previous downturn was 2001 and we saw a decline in average ticket. That was a little bit of a leading indicator. Now we have to be careful because ticket can be affected by things like weather. So when you have big ticket sales, for example, in the first and second quarter on things like tractors, weather can impact that. So we do watch ticket carefully. We balance that with transactions. What we\u2019re seeing in the business right now we like a lot. We see a nice balance between ticket transactions.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And in fact transact accelerated through the quarter.\nCraig Menear: Yes.\nMichael Lasser: Throughout the quarter?\nCraig Menear: Yes.\nMichael Lasser: And Carol you mentioned that you anticipate some share gains in the fourth quarter. Historically you really haven\u2019t factored share gains into your longer-term outlook. What\u2019s changing now that\u2019s giving you the confidence to put that in there where you had an impact?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, as we look at the environment we see that there are share donors in certain categories. Ted called out that appliances was a double-digit comp for us in the third quarter. It contributed 50 basis points of our overall growth in the quarter, as for the year. And so as we look to the fourth quarter, it\u2019s always a big appliance selling season and we would expect to continue to grow appliances in the fourth quarter.\nCraig Menear: Michael, we\u2019ve obviously made a lot of investments over the past few years to make sure we\u2019re positioned to be able to capture that.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. And if I could add one last one on the SG&A recognizing that you have one-time items quarter-in and quarter-out, good guys and no so good guys. So SG&A has been growing 2% to 4% after being up at a much more moderate pace, I\u2019m talking on a per square foot basis. So are we just at a point where the business requires a little bit more investment because you\u2019ve had so many years of strong comp, and so the flow through might not be as strong moving forward?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, I can take you back to the beginning of the year. We said that our expenses would grow at 40% of our sales growth rate. We are now seeing that our expenses this year will grow at 32% of our sales growth rate. And what that means, year-to-date our expenses have grown at 37.5% of our sales growth rate. For the fourth quarter, we should expect a lot of leverage on the SG&A line, principally because we have year-over-year expense items that we will not repeat in the fourth quarter of this year. Last year we had outperformance and bonus, we had some store cleanup costs. Those items will not repeat in the fourth quarter of this year, so expect a good flow through. Longer term, as we talked about and we talked about this at the beginning of the year, because of items like rising people costs and we\u2019re not alone. All companies are faced with rising people costs, over the longer term we would expect our expenses to grow at 50% of our sales growth rate. And we\u2019re not providing guidance for 2017 today but you would expect next year for us to come back and tell you it should be more in the 50% area.\nMichael Lasser: Excellent. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now hear from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.\nSeth Sigman: Thanks and good morning. I just want to follow up on the question about the cycle and the outlook for demand in the category. Can you give us a sense of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of bigger ticket discretionary projects? Are you seeing any sort of change in the types of projects consumers or Pros are focused on, basically anything that would indicate that we\u2019re maybe heading into a different part of the cycle?\nCraig Menear: When you look at the larger ticket sales, it\u2019s coming we believe from multiple areas. It\u2019s coming from the strength in the Pro business, it\u2019s coming from our services business, it\u2019s coming from things like the appliance sales growth. So it\u2019s a broad aspect of drivers behind the ticket. And when you look at the third quarter, actually our transactions over $900 was the largest quarter growth of the year.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I think it\u2019s important to just step back and look at where we are in terms of the cycle and focus on home price appreciation, because that\u2019s a big driver of our business. Since 2011, homeowners have seen a 95% increase in their home equity. That\u2019s come about because of rising prices as well as if you have a mortgage, you\u2019ve been making mortgage payments since 2011. So homeowners really do view their home as an investment and not an expense. So the question is, okay, great, well what does it mean for 2017 and beyond? While we see home prices have recovered in certain parts of the country, there are other parts of the country where we are still double-digit down from peak. Those areas include Chicago and Atlanta. So in terms of where we are for the cycle, you can\u2019t look at the averages because the averages will kill you. You have to look at the market. And when you look at the market, we see real opportunity for continued improvement. There\u2019s really interesting statistics that comes out of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies and they call it the leading indicator of remodeling activity. And this leading indicator of remodeling activity suggests continued growth throughout the fourth quarter, throughout 2017. They don\u2019t produce the report past 2017 but their work suggests we will continue to grow.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe a good follow up here would be you guys have rolled out a couple of key offerings to better serve the Pro including credit and advanced delivery options. I know it\u2019s very early, but do you think that\u2019s playing a role in driving big ticket and the strength we saw this quarter? And do you think these options are driving in maybe a different customer or changing behavior within the store?\nCraig Menear: As you said, we\u2019re still in the process of rolling out, it\u2019s early days. We have not completed the rollout of BODFS, our Buy Online, Deliver from Store, yet we\u2019re now up to about 1,600 stores where we\u2019ve launched the program. As I mentioned in my comments, we\u2019ve seen double-digit growth in deliveries. So certainly we think that that is beginning to have a positive impact and making it easier for our Pro customers as well as DIY customers to engage and shop with The Home Depot.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: On the credit side, it\u2019s important to note that we have little over 900,000 Pros that hold a private label credit card with us. We\u2019ve converted over 20% of those Pros onto our new value product. And for those who have converted, 64% of those are activating the new value prop. So we see growth in those accounts. And as we continue to convert and add new Pros into the program, we expect this to be a top line benefit. Today, it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s not materially impacting the top line but it\u2019s growing and we expect that to continue to grow over time.\nSeth Sigman: That\u2019s great color. That\u2019s very much.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nChristopher Horvers: So I wanted to follow up on the hurricane. The $100 dollars of sales related to storms, is that hurricane and flooding combined? And just related to the hurricane, can you talk about how much the hurricane lifted the month of October in the U.S.?\nCraig Menear: The number is both in total. Candidly, the flooding has been an impact throughout the entire quarter and a larger driver.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It was the biggest part of that $100 million.\nChristopher Horvers: Interesting. So the hurricane lift to October actually sounds like it was certainly \u2013 if you\u2019re talking about 50 basis points for the quarter and most of that being related to flooding then maybe 50, 70 basis points of lift to the month of October simply from the hurricane?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Not that much.\nCraig Menear: No.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Just the timing of the hurricane and where it hit; not that much. We saw significant cost coming of the flooding. In fact, I think you know we had to shut down a store, we lost a store. Part of those storm-related expenses I called out on the SG&A line is because we had a \u2013 it could liquidate the inventory, clean up the store and get it back open which we did do, which is very exciting for us.\nCraig Menear: Yes, the flooding happened at the end of Q2. So the flooding impact was the entire quarter and was a much bigger impact. Obviously, the hurricane was in October.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then one of the questions that we\u2019re getting is how you\u2019re thinking about or what\u2019s implied in the fourth quarter related to annual guidance? I think some of the more skeptical investors out there are saying, hey look, you know, Home Depot is sort of implying EPS and comps below where the street is sitting for the fourth quarter. So can you talk about how you thought about approaching the guidance on the year and then how you thought about addressing those questions to investors?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I think the easiest way to think about this is on a two-year stack basis. So the implied comp for the fourth quarter is a little over 3%. If you look at a three-year stack for the first half of 2016, the two-year stack comp is 10.6%. If you look at the two-year stack comp for Q3, it\u2019s 10.6%. If you look then at the forecasted two-year stack comp for Q4, it\u2019s over 10%. So skepticism abound, but we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we give based on these two-year stack.\nChristopher Horvers: Perfect. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.\nScott Mushkin: Thanks, guys. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to poke a little bit more thinking about the environment going forward. Obviously, we had a big election and the market has taken off. But as we think about your business, obviously Pro has grown pretty fast but we have SG&A maybe growing about 50% of sales I think is what\u2019s been said. So as we kind of think about the construct of '17 and beyond and knowing that there\u2019s a lot of dry powder in the housing market, how do you guys think about your growth rate as we move out of the fourth quarter which has got a lot of noise and go into '17 and '18? Do you think we\u2019re at the end of the cycle or could this cycle be a lot different?\nCraig Menear: The first comment I\u2019d make, obviously we\u2019re not prepared to talk about '17. We\u2019ll do that on our next call. But what I would say is if you look at the drivers of growth, we don\u2019t see significant change in the drivers of growth. We\u2019ve had foundational GDP growth. We\u2019ve had in housing home value appreciation, housing turnover, new household formation and then layer on top of that 65% of the housing stock in the U.S. is now in excess of 30 years old. All of those are drivers of business for us. There\u2019s nothing that would indicate that we see that those would change. And as Carol said, there\u2019s varying degrees of recovery amongst different parts of the country. So we don\u2019t see anything on the horizon at this stage that would say anything should change in terms of the growth drivers in our business.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And if you recall the investor conference we had in December of last year, we set forth a sales target of $101 million and operating margin target of 14.5% by 2018. As we sit here today, nothing has taken us off of that target.\nScott Mushkin: I guess I was even thinking the more bullish side, could we \u2013 the recovery we\u2019ve called it a zombie economy, growth cession, we\u2019ve had a lot of different of words we\u2019ve used for it. Is it conceivable as you look at your business over the last three or four years that it\u2019s been obviously very good but a better environment, a better macro environment could drive growth higher? And have you guys thought about that?\nCraig Menear: It\u2019s possible but we\u2019re focused on the numbers that Carol just shared that we\u2019ve laid out in our investor conference. That\u2019s roughly $12 billion plus worth of growth between now and 2018 from where we started this year and that\u2019s the equivalent of opening 357 new Home Depot stores which we won\u2019t do. So that\u2019s no small hill and we\u2019re focused on achieving those numbers.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: The good thing is, Scott, we got a supply chain, we got a staffing model, we can adopt or change or adjust to whatever demand is coming our way.\nScott Mushkin: And then just one \u2013 thank you for that. Just one clarification. Was the Pro growth sequentially, is it sequentially speeding up? And then I\u2019ll yield. Thank you.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: The Pro growth was higher than the DIY growth in the third quarter but the sequential comment had to do with transactions not customer segment.\nScott Mushkin: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning. Following up on some commentary, Craig, you were making about big ticket, so we know it was very strong and I think you called out appliances, flooring and roofing and that you\u2019ve always try to gauge the balance of it. I guess for those categories to have been strong in Q3, how should we gauge the sustainability of those? Appliances seems to have been a share gaining category, it\u2019s been good for a while, it\u2019s probably a big fourth quarter category. Is flooring and roofing more weather dependent or is that more seasonal, or is it lasting?\nCraig Menear: Roofing obviously can be seasonal depending on what happens. If you get ice and snow, you\u2019re not really repairing \u2013 you might repair but you won\u2019t replace a roof. Flooring is less seasonal overall.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then as a follow up I guess to thinking about, I think Carol you talked about looking at individual markets that there\u2019s still some room to go. Can you distill a little further? You gave us geographic color by market. Can you talk about any performance? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s oil markets, rural markets, any disparities on a regional level sort of beneath the geographic data that you provide, better or worse, that you could gauge the overall environment with?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, in certain geographies like Texas where you may say that how the sale is performing there? We see double-digit comps in parts of Texas. So Texas is doing very well. I will tell you our stores in North Dakota are negative comping; two stores in North Dakota, so that\u2019s not a surprise to us. It doesn\u2019t matter to the overall company but that\u2019s not a surprise. On balance, as Craig pointed out, we\u2019ve got good growth across the country with opportunity for more growth.\nSimeon Gutman: And the way you look at pent-up demand you\u2019ve shown us categories that have not reached their full potential. Do you look at your markets that way? Can you share any color about the number of our markets where we don\u2019t think the housing market or our business has gotten back to let\u2019s say some normalized demand level or has potential to keep going?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, we do look at it that way and as we\u2019ve look peak to [indiscernible] markets that have not fully recovered.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now hear from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Fassler: Thanks a lot and good morning to you. First question should be a fairly simple one. You gave us the comp for the big ticket bucket. Can you give us the small ticket and then we can solve for the rest of the business please?\nCraig Menear: Under 50, Matt, was 1.6% comp.\nMatthew Fassler: Got it, understood. And then secondly, you talked about share gains. You spoke about particularly categories like appliances which are more DIY focused. Can you give us a sense of the pace of share gains that you\u2019re seeing in Pro and perhaps some of the categories that might be standing out from that perspective? And your sense I guess as part of that as to how the Pro market looks today from a growth perspective relative to DIY?\nCraig Menear: I would say the Pro is very strong. One thing we saw this quarter is we\u2019ve always talked about the high-spend Pro and the low-spend Pro. The low-spend Pro comp was on par with the high-spend Pro. So that\u2019s nice to see not only geographical but the high and low spend are each comping at that stronger rate in consumer. And as we look across departments, virtually every department had higher Pro spend comp than consumer. So the Pro is strong across the business. We continue to be extremely pleased with our lumber, building material business. Our tool business in particular just continues to accelerate and we\u2019re taking meaningful share in the tools business.\nMatthew Fassler: And presumably we can tie to some degree that migration to Pro with the overall strong performance were the bigger ticket baskets for you?\nCraig Menear: Certainly, yes.\nMatthew Fassler: Okay. Thank you so much for that detail. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We\u2019ll continue on to Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDaniel Binder: Thanks. A few questions. First, August stood out as sort of a softer month. Was there anything in particular that you would highlight there?\nCraig Menear: It was an extremely warm month.\nDaniel Binder: Okay. And then in the appliance business, it looked like the industry as well as you were a little bit more aggressive year-over-year. I suspect it may be in part to what you highlighted earlier just in terms of wanting to take share. But I was curious what your feelings were about the health of the appliance industry given what we\u2019ve heard from vendors and what you see in your own business. In other words, is it taking higher promotions to drive that comp?\nCraig Menear: No, our promotional cadence is almost identical to last year and we see the strength in our portfolio across all of our brands and very, very strong across the board.\nDaniel Binder: And then lastly on holiday, the holiday business every year that business seems to get bigger and I was just curious how you\u2019ve ordered for this year? Is it up \u2013 are orders up double digit, what are you expecting in terms of the contribution to the fourth quarter?\nCraig Menear: Well, it\u2019s a big business and a growing business. It\u2019s still for the quarter not a determinative business for us. But yes, we bought into that. That was part of our growth in inventory and we\u2019re expecting another great holiday season. I\u2019d say also on the back of our Halloween and Harvest, we bought into that as well this past year. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the performance of that deck of holiday segment and looking forward to an equally strong Christmas period as well.\nDaniel Binder: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: And Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank has our next question.\nMike Baker: Thanks. So I just wanted to follow up on the Pro and can you estimate for us what you think your share of the Pro business is compared to your share of DIY? And eventually what do you think you could gain in terms of share for the Pro business?\nCraig Menear: So share around the Pro is a little bit elusive but again, we try to triangulate on the number. I think what we\u2019ve looked at is we\u2019re playing now in a $550 billion market with the addition of the MRO for hospitality, institutional and multifamily. We think total share for The Home Depot plays somewhere in the 15% range inclusive of all of Pro and DIY and services, and we believe that our DIY share is sitting somewhere in the neighborhood of 27% to 28%.\nMike Baker: Okay. And so we back into Pro being about 10% given the penetration --?\nCraig Menear: 10% or 12% give or take, yes.\nMike Baker: Okay. Thank you. And then a couple of other follow-ups. Promotional cadence, you said you were relatively similar but what have you seen from any of your competitors? And particularly on appliances, one of the big vendors had pretty strong appliance units but very low dollars because of mix and pricing. So I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing any of your competitors be irrational, because that\u2019s something that I think has impacted you guys in the past when some competitors got a little irrational with appliances.\nCraig Menear: Well, I would say appliance is included but our entire Q4 cadence is identical. I can\u2019t think of anything that were meaningfully different from Q4 of last year. I would say broadly across the business in portfolio and categories, we are focused on offering an everyday low price to our Pro and consumer customers.\nMike Baker: Right. So that\u2019s your offering. You\u2019re not seeing anything irrational from competitors I guess is the question.\nCraig Menear: Time to time, folks run promotions; they try to drive their business. That\u2019s just the nature of the business these days and we see that. We see that with the competition but we\u2019re going to work hard to try to remain focused on our everyday value for our customer.\nMike Baker: Okay, great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll continue on to Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Carol, one question on the inventory side; I think obviously last quarter you mentioned some error in the algorithm and just curious if you could update us there as far as where you guys are on the in-stock? And then more broadly just how you\u2019re thinking about inventory management now and in the future? We\u2019ve heard a lot of suppliers talk about inventory adjustments, the big customers and curious if you feel that to be somewhat tied to just the end market of point of sale or if that\u2019s more strategy on the distribution side?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, I talk about some of the inventory findings. First, our in-stock rates are a tick higher than they were year-on-year. That\u2019s exactly where we want them to be. We bought in for the season, so our inventory is healthy. We are ready for this season. The quality of inventory has never been better. If I look at clearance, in active, e-velocity, we\u2019re at the lowest levels in the 21 years that I\u2019ve been here. So never better in terms of quality. And in terms of where we think the inventory may go, we\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives on the way in the supply chain roles and maybe Mark Holifield could comment on Supply Chain Sync and so on and so forth.\nMark Holifield: Yes. We\u2019re pleased with the results of the Supply Chain Sync, certainly pleased right now with the state of our inventory. As Carol outlined, a tick higher than last year, well prepared for Q4 and we\u2019ve increased our JLQs for our Pro customers a bit. In terms of Sync, we continue to roll that out. The way to think about that, our RDC network handles about half of our cost to goods sold. We\u2019re live in two-thirds of our RDCs at this point with about two-thirds of the COGS, the cost of goods sold, dollar volume through there. We will be rolling to the north RDCs here as we go through the next several months and that will complete the rollout in terms of the RDCs, and then we\u2019ll continue to roll to other vendors as we continue.\nCraig Menear: I think the most important thing as it relates to inventory, obviously we look for productivity but first and foremost is we\u2019re looking to continually improve our overall in-stock position and be able to take care of the customers\u2019 needs in the quantities that they need.\nDennis McGill: Okay. And then second question just as it relates to both Canada and Mexico I guess kind of different impacts going on, but hoping you can maybe speak to the fundamental backdrop in Canada with housing market looking a little bit weaker there, just what you\u2019re seeing as far as your performance, whether that\u2019s share gain or maybe we shouldn\u2019t be worried about some of the housing metrics? And then in Mexico under the new administration, any thoughts as how it could impact your business with policy or immigration reform, et cetera?\nCraig Menear: Yes, let me start with Mexico. Obviously, there have been changes in Mexico over the years. We\u2019ve been able to drive an unbelievable performance in Mexico through all those changes and we\u2019ll continue to see us doing that. We\u2019re very pleased with our business in Mexico. The team has done a phenomenal job down there of growing that business and positioning us as the largest home improvement retailer in Mexico. As it relates to Canada, clearly what you\u2019ve seen in Canada and what we\u2019ve experienced is in the province of Alberta, in Saskatchewan where more dependent upon energy, clearly we have seen fresher there that we haven\u2019t seen in the balance of the country. But the team has worked hard to offset that pressure and grow the business overall. And we\u2019re very pleased with our business in Canada and the team has done an amazing job to offset that pressure in the West.\nDennis McGill: Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer, please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel: First question, and this I know is a really big picture and early. But with the change in administration here in the United States, any initial thoughts as to how you\u2019re thinking at Home Depot how the shifting political landscape could impact your company?\nCraig Menear: Our job is to stay focused on our customer to make sure that we\u2019re driving the most convenient interconnected experience leveraging all the asset base that we have and that we\u2019re driving value for our customers through great values and through great innovation. That is our sole focus. It\u2019s what we\u2019re all about. It\u2019s what we need to stay in tune with so that we stay relevant to our customers.\nBrian Nagel: Okay. I appreciate that. And then secondly on the \u2013 I know there\u2019s been other questions on appliance as well, but my question here is it seems as though just watching a wide number of \u2013 a large number of retailers that more and more chains of various sizes are pushing into this business. So with that I guess I\u2019m asking are you seeing increased competition from other retailers pushing into the business. And if so, what form is that taking and have you had to change or are you considering changing how you go to market in appliance as a result of that?\nCraig Menear: Yes, there are obviously more folks jumping into this business. But again, as Ted described, we have a very strong appliance business. We\u2019re gaining share in the category. We like our model.\nTed Decker: Yes, we\u2019ve not seen an impact from new entrants and we don\u2019t envision any change to our go to market strategy on appliances.\nBrian Nagel: Thank you.\nOperator: Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Carol, I wanted to go back to one of your earlier comments regarding market-by-market differences. Yes we know that some markets haven\u2019t necessarily recovered from a home price perspective, but we actually have seen pretty rapid home price appreciation in other markets. And at least in pockets, we\u2019re starting to hear about some pricing pressure in some of those. So I guess the question is, are there some high, let\u2019s call it, home appreciation markets where you\u2019re starting to see any flowing in big ticket sales?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, so I actually looked at that this morning. I went to the San Francisco Bay area and I went to Seattle, because those are two markets where you\u2019re seeing real home price appreciation. And I went to see how we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in big ticket or anything that would cause us to be concerned, and we don\u2019t see anything at this point.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got you. Okay. And then just quickly shifting to gross margin, I know you previously talked about gross margin expansion in the back half of this year. Maybe I just had the cadence a bit wrong, but I guess I would have expected some modest expansion in 3Q. Was there anything else that may have impacted the gross margin that you didn\u2019t already cite? And has your outlook for 4Q changed at all?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: No. We were very pleased with our gross margin performance in the third quarter. We expanded by 6 basis points. And based on the guidance I had given you, you should expect similar expansion in the fourth quarter.\nScot Ciccarelli: Roger that. All right, thanks guys.\nOperator: Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities, please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is around trade up and trade down. Have you guys seen any trends in consumers trading up to more expensive products with Interline or trading down for that matter?\nTed Decker: That\u2019s something we watch and have given color on previously and we see a similar trend where our comps are strong across the value line with higher comps in the higher price point goods. And we think that is a lot driven by innovation in the fabulous product that we\u2019re bringing to the market.\nCraig Menear: Yes, if you think about the two products in power tools that Ted called out in his comments, those are unbelievable innovations that clearly help drive ticket within the category and expansion of benefits for the customer.\nSeth Basham: Got it. And in terms of big projects that consumers are doing, are we seeing bigger tickets associated with those projects as they prefer more expensive items to complete them?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: You can look at our services business and our services business up year-on-year. We exited a few businesses at the end of last year. If you ignore the businesses that you exited, our services business which has an average ticket north of $1,000 grew faster than the company average in the third quarter.\nSeth Basham: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGregory Melich: Great. I have two questions. I think one is just a follow-up, Carol, on Interline in that last comment. So if we look at Interline, could you give us the impact on SG&A in the quarter and also just how that business is going? Presumably it\u2019s also growing faster than the company average.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: So Interline contributed $300 million of growth year-on-year. The gross margin [ph] obviously impacted the gross margin. And in terms of EPS, we generated $0.02 of EPS off of Interline in the quarter.\nGregory Melich: And what did it do into SG&A?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It was pressure. It was in the overall guidance that we gave.\nGregory Melich: Okay, so we\u2019ll back into that. And EPS was slightly accretive?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, about $0.02.\nGregory Melich: And then my real question sort of ties back to the SG&A. I think you mentioned that given rising wage pressures and other costs that we should go forward thinking about 50% growth of sales into 2017 and perhaps beyond. How should we think of that? Is it simply if sales are growing 5% that we should assume SG&A dollars grow 2.5%, or is there like a baseline that it grows and then it\u2019s 50% of a comp above that or am I thinking about it too much?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: You\u2019re thinking about it too much, because our \u2013 our largest expense is payroll and we have an activity-based model. And so we have so much opportunity to adjust to the payroll staffing out of our stores. So just use 50%. Will it be perfect? No, but it\u2019s good enough for modeling purposes.\nGregory Melich: Okay. And so that\u2019s more of just letting us know that the fourth quarter where SG&A really isn\u2019t going to grow, as a comparison issue we shouldn\u2019t use that as a new trend. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Exactly.\nGregory Melich: Got it. And then last, if I could sneak one in, the Pro side of the business if we were to disaggregate it and think about the buckets that were driving it, I think in the beginning, Craig, you mentioned a few different things. The new credit offer was last but delivery was focused. Could you give us any highlights there like, Carol, you did on the credit as to how the delivery tick-up is doing and how you see the customer changing as they do that?\nCraig Menear: Again, we\u2019re now rolled out with a new delivery program in about 1,600 stores and again, we\u2019ve seen double-digit growth in deliveries. Now all of that is incremental. We think roughly 50% of that is incremental sales growth, but clearly some customers are taking up on the offer that we might have picked it up before as well. We anticipated that that would happen.\nGregory Melich: Great. And how many of your Pros do you think have used it?\nCraig Menear: That I don\u2019t know.\nGregory Melich: Okay. Thanks. Good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff: We have time for one more question, Catherine.\nOperator: Yes, ma\u2019am. We\u2019ll go to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.\nPeter Keith: Thanks for letting me in. Great quarter.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nPeter Keith: I was curious on the recent step up in mortgage rates the last couple of days, if you have any thought on how that may or may not impact your business and maybe even making some comparisons back to 2013 when we saw another sharp rate increase?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. So we look at the affordability index, which is over 150%, so that\u2019s good news. So now we went back and looked at, okay, historical percentages of household income used for mortgage payments. If you look at the years 1995 through 2000, 22% of homeowners\u2019 income was used for their mortgage payment. It\u2019s down now to about 14%. Interest rates could go up to 7% and no one is suggesting that will happen. But interest rates can go up to 7% and we would be back to about 22% of household income used for mortgage payment. So we got a long way to go before there\u2019s any impact we think to our business from rising interest rates.\nPeter Keith: Okay, that\u2019s interesting. Thank you. And maybe last for me, it\u2019s interesting that mix was at gross margin positive. I guess we\u2019re not used to seeing that in your business. Could you talk about what happened there and is that something that we might see going forward?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, we had higher penetration of certain categories that had higher margin not because their retails went up but because we took cost out. I think we\u2019ve talked to you in the past that we stood up a cost-out team that works with our merchants, and we really do try to drive productivity in our cost of goods sold. So it was that dynamic of a higher penetration in categories with cost out that really gave us the margin expansion.\nPeter Keith: Okay. Thanks a lot and good luck in the fourth quarter.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you everyone today for joining us. We look forward to talking with your on February for our fourth quarter earnings call. Talk to you then.\nOperator: Thank you.

Now before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Diane, and good morning everyone. We had a solid quarter achieving a milestone of the highest quarterly sales and earnings results in Company history. Sales for the second quarter were $26.5 billion, up 6.6% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.7% from last year and our U.S stores had a positive comp of 5.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.97 in the second quarter, up 13.9% versus last year. In the U.S., all three of our divisions posted positive comps in the second quarter led by our Western division. In all 19 U.S regions and top 40 markets saw single to double-digit comps in the quarter. Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency making it 51 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted positive comps in local currency for a total of 19 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. We continue to see broad-based growth across our stores both ticket and transactions grew. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro sales outpacing our DIY business in the U.S. The Interline integration is progressing as we continue to deliver on the acquisitions of value drivers. We\u2019ve been piloting our first business use case offering Interline's catalog of products to Pros shopping Home Depot stores. We are pleased with the traction that we've seen in this pilot although it is still early days. We continue to work towards leveraging Interline's capabilities to expand our share of wallet with our current customers, as well as gain new customers. Our online business had sales growth of approximately 19% versus last year and represented 5.6% of total sales. As Ted will detail, we continue to leverage our merchandising tools to refine product offerings across channels based on customer preferences. Our goal is to provide our customers with the convenient and fulfillment options they desire. We continue to build our capabilities to improve the overall customer experience. For example, in recent months we began implementing our dynamic ETA feature for online purchases. Dynamic ETA provides a delivery date based on the customer's location. In the past, we issued a generic delivery window estimate, which allowed for extra time or cushion for the delivery commitment to customers. As we\u2019ve begun to implement the dynamic ETA, our promised delivery date to customers is earlier and more accurately estimated. As a result, we're seeing an increased conversion in customer satisfaction. We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain as the dividends from investments made over the past several years yield a positive impact on our inventory productivity, logistics costs, and service to our stores and customers. As you know, we see our supply chain transformation as an ongoing work in progress and continue to optimize our network with initiatives like supply-chain Sync. Sync is in the early stages of a multiyear rollout. We're investing to more effectively meet our customer's demands. The rollout of COMS, our new Customer Order Management System, is now fully deployed in all U.S stores. The next phase of COM is to optimize and fine-tune this new system. Following behind COM is the rollout of BODFS or Buy Online Deliver From Store, which we expect to be completed by the end of the fiscal year. While we had a strong quarter, as you've heard we're instituting a high degree of change across many areas of the business. With this amount of change there will be learnings and opportunities to refine the process along the way. In the quarter, we identified several opportunities for improvement, particularly, around inventory management and freight handling, which we're working to address. Turning to the macro environment, we continue to see positive signs in the housing data, which we believe serve as a tailwind for our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and increasing our earnings per share guidance for the year to reflect our outperformance this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. A successful spring season depends on the hard work and dedication of the 400,000 plus associates we have serving our customers today. I want to close by thanking them. Based on the first half results, almost 100% of our stores qualified for success, sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. We are very proud of their efforts. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig, and good morning everyone. We were pleased with our results in the second quarter. Core maintenance and repair categories, as well as many Pro heavy categories continue to have solid performance in the quarter. Our growth in the quarter was balanced. Total comp transactions grew by 2.2% for the quarter, while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Ticket growth was driven by an increase in items per basket as project business continued to show strength. Our average ticket was also positively impacted from slight commodity price inflation, mainly from building materials and lumber. The total impact to ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 18 basis points. In addition, the stronger U.S dollar had a negative impact to our average ticket growth with approximately 69 basis points. Focusing on big ticket sales in the second quarter, transactions for tickets over $900 representing approximately 20% of our U.S sales were up 8.1%. The drivers behind the increasing big ticket purchases for HVAC, appliances, and roofing. All merchandising departments posted positive comps led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. Tools, lumber, plumbing, d\u00e9cor, indoor garden, building materials, and lighting were above the Company's average comp. Hardware, outdoor garden, kitchen, bath, millwork, electrical, paint and flooring were positive, but below the Company average. As Craig mentioned, we continue to see notable strength with our Pro customers. Pro sales grew faster than the Company comp, led by our high spend Pro customers. This continued strength led to comps above the Company average in commercial, industrial lighting, fencing, power tools, power tool accessories, wiring devices and interior doors. We saw continued strength in the core of the store, as our customers undertook various projects. For example, landscape lighting, laminate, and vinyl flooring, garage organizations and cleaning had strong comps for the quarter. Widespread and record setting heat in the quarter drove strong performance in HVAC, air conditioning, fans, and air circulation. Sales were also strong in categories like irrigation and watering still over double-digit comps. Our store associates did an exceptional job executing our summer events and creating excitement in our stores. Our Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Fourth of July events provided excellent value and we saw strong demand from our customers. These events help drive robust comps in appliances, tool storage, outdoor power, and grills. In our ongoing effort to update and refresh our assortments, we continually leverage our merchandising tools to fine tune our online and in store assortments. One specific example of this is with our Patio offering. We found that many customers want to come into our stores to purchase and pick up their Patio Sets. We altered our assortment and put certain Patio Sets back into the store. This strategic move was well-received by our customers, leading to record sales and sell-through in our stores. Our online business had strong growth in the quarter with double-digit traffic growth and improvement in conversion. Our interconnected retail initiatives continue to evolve to meet the changing demands of our customers. Mobile and tablet are over 50% of our traffic and are important tools that our customers use to engage with our products, our stores and our associates. We are enhancing the functionality in mobile with features like larger and clear product images, live mobile chat, and a simplified checkout experience. As evidence of the success of our interconnected strategy, approximately 42% of our online orders are now leveraging our store footprint for fulfillment and nearly 90% of our online product returns are processed through the convenience of our stores. Now let's turn our attention to the third quarter. Our focus on innovation is a key part of our strategy. For our Pro customers we will be introducing the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system in our stores this fall. This DEWALT system uses the innovative FLEXVOLT battery, which identifies various types of DEWALT tools and adjust voltage to provide the appropriate level of power needed. These products provide corded performance without the code and the innovative brushless motors increase tool runtime and durability, saving our Pros time and money on their job sites. Among big box retailers, the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system can only be found at the Home Depot. As smart devices continue to resonate with customers, we're excited about expanding smart technology with the new Ryobi garage door opener. This innovative system connects with any smart device and allows our customers to operate the garage door remotely, talk on the phone or play music through an embedded Bluetooth speaker or park with ease using the laser park assist attachment. The new exclusive Ryobi garage door opener can only be found at the Home Depot. The fall season and cooler temperatures are just around the corner and we have an incredible line up of great values and special buys for our customers during our Labor Day, fall cleanup and Halloween harvest events. With the Halloween harvest season we\u2019ve a tremendous amount of new seasonal products like the exclusive animated window projector kit, which allows our customers to easily decorate their windows with animated digital holiday clips. This is the first digital decoration in the marketplace and it is exclusive to the Home Depot. Our exciting third quarter events along with outstanding execution in stores will position us for success in the third quarter. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Ted, and hello, everyone. Before I review our results, I\u2019d like to remind you that our net earnings for the second quarter of 2015 included a pre-tax net expense of $92 million related to our 2014 data breach and a $144 million pre-tax gain on sale of HD supply common stock. When added together these two items contributed $0.02 of diluted earnings per share last year that did not repeat this year. So with that, let\u2019s get started. In the second quarter, sales were $26.5 billion, a 6.6% increase from last year driven primarily by positive comp sales, as well as the impact of Interline brand versus last year a stronger U.S dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $181 million or 0.7%. Our total Company comp store same-store sales were positive 4.7% for the quarter with positive comps of 2.3% in May, 7.5% in June and 4.5% in July. Comps for U.S stores were positive 5.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 3% in May, 8.4% in June and 5% in July. Our monthly comp sales were a bit distorted by the timing of Memorial Day. Last year Memorial Day sales were included in our May results and this year they were included in our June results. Adjusting for this timing shift, our U.S comps would have been 4.3% in May, 7% in June, and 5% in July. Our total Company gross margin was 33.7% for the quarter, an increase of 3 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors. First, as expected, we had 22 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain driven primarily by increased productivity and by lower fuel costs. And finally, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion due primarily to reaching higher co-op and rebate tiers in certain category classes, which lowered our costs. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 78 basis points to 18.2%. As I mentioned, our expenses in 2015 included $92 million of net data breach related expenses that did not repeat in 2016. In the quarter, we were pleased with our expense performance, as total expenses were under our plan. Due to our continued focus on expense control, we now believe that our fiscal 2016 expenses will grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rates. Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.5%, an increase of 81 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $228 million, up $144 million from last year reflecting last year's pre-tax gain on sale of HD supply common stock that did not repeat this year. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 37% compared to 37.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.97, an increase of 13.9% from last year. Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $12.3 billion, up $464 million from last year due primarily to the impact of Interline. Inventory turns were 5.2x, up 1/10 from the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year accounts payable increased by $778 million to $8.3 billion reflecting the timing of purchases and the impact of Interline. In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.46 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 29%, 400 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Now turning our attention to the full-year. Recent GDP growth estimate suggests a slowdown in the U.S economy from what we expected. But we are encouraged by the strength of our core business as the U.S housing market continues to recover. Based on our first half performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming the sales growth guidance we laid out at the end of our first quarter. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Implied with this guidance is the comp for the second half of fiscal 2016 of approximately 4.3%. This is not a reflection of the sequential slowdown in sales, but rather a reflection of year-over-year performance. On a two-year stack basis, we expect our comps in the back half of the year to be about the same as what we reported for the first half of the year. While we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance, we are lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year principally because of better expense control and therefore more operating leverage than we anticipated at the end of the first quarter. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.6% to $6.31. So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And Shirlone, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will have our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning. There was a lot of noise it sounds like in the early part of the quarter with weather and some Memorial Day shift. Do you -- was there any, I don\u2019t know if it's possible to measure this, but do you think there was some degree of demand destruction that you didn\u2019t pick up, granted June, July improved. But I\u2019m trying to get a sense if you think underlying demand could actually be stronger than it looks?\nCraig Menear: I think, there is no doubt to your point that May result was a tough start. When you look at variability in the quarter month-to-month compared to a year-ago, we had higher variability and part of that was clearly driven by weather. An example would be in Washington DC alone there were 20 days of rain in the month of May. So it's hard to tell, but clearly we know there was an impact.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then, my follow-up, I mean there is a lot of noise in retail across many segments. You mentioned that the housing or housing outlook is fine. I know this seems obvious, but can you maybe just talk about what gives you confidence in it? Is it the Pro growth, is it the type of projects, I\u2019m sure it's all the above, but I would love to hear just some color on that topic?\nCraig Menear: So clearly when we look at housing, things that we focus on our own value appreciation which continues to grow, we look at housing turnover which is kind of running that norms, a little north of 4% of the housing stock is projected to turn in fiscal 2016. And then we look at new household formations and all of those are drivers in our business and all those continue to recover.\nCarol Tome: But I'd say what gives us confidence is strengthen the big ticket as Ted called out another outstanding quarter in our big ticket categories. As Ted also called out, the growth in the quarter was balanced between ticket and transactions and part of the ticket growth was item in the basket growth. And that tells us that the project business is alive and well. And then finally we look at the strength in Pro and our Pro business outpaced our DIY business. So when you couple just the trends that we see in our existing business coupled with what we see in housing, it gives us confidence for the back half of the year.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: We will go next to Kate McShane, Citi Research.\nKate McShane: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. This might sound a little nitpicky, so I apologize, but I just had noticed in your prepared comments that you had mentioned that kitchen specifically was below the Company average comp. And I was just trying to reconcile the strength that you saw in Pro during the quarter versus some of this merchandise commentary and what you are seeing more specifically in terms of what is driving that Pro business in Q2?\nTed Decker: Well, our overall kitchen business did comp positively. The special order kitchens are not as much of a Pro category. The take with kitchens, our in stock kitchen business is more the Pro business and that in fact was a stronger comp than the special order.\nCarol Tome: You\u2019d expect to see some seasonality in our kitchen business. People are on vacation during the summer time, putting a new kitchen into your home isn't really top of your mind. We expect the kitchen business to come back in the fall time, because it typically does.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to John Baugh, Stifel.\nJohn Baugh: Thank you. Congratulations on a strong quarter. I was just curious on payables which were quite strong. You mentioned timing. If you could just talk about the sustainability of that number in the second half and whether your free cash flow assumptions have changed at all for the year? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Hey, John. The payables performance at the end of the third quarter was a reflection of increased purchases. Craig commented in his remarks that we had some learnings during the quarter and one of those learnings was actually we had an error in our order logic that we use for inventory purchases. And so we corrected that error and have corrected it and actually sent purchases to our suppliers, so that is just the timing matter. It will normalize itself by the end of the year. So this isn't a consistent trend.\nJohn Baugh: Great. Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Yes.\nCarol Tome: Yes.\nOperator: We will go next to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning.\nTed Decker: Good morning.\nChristopher Horvers: I wanted to talk about inventories a little bit. We\u2019ve heard a number of vendors talk about inventory destocking at retail, orders down in the second quarter. Is that process largely behind The Home Depot? Does it in any way reflect a less robust outlook for the market? And I know, Craig, you mentioned learnings and process improvement around inventory management and freight handling. Did that have any impact in terms of what we heard from the vendor community?\nCraig Menear: Hey Chris, as Carol just mentioned, one of the learnings this quarter was in fact that we did have an error in an update logic that we put into our replenishment. We identified that, corrected it, and that clearly did have an impact on the order flow that happened during the quarter that has been corrected moving forward.\nChristopher Horvers: Okay. And just thinking about the weather and thinking about the first half in the upcoming fourth quarter, in retrospect now that you are further along, could you reassess the amount of pull forward and the bathtub effect between the first quarter and the second quarter? And as you think about lapping this upcoming fourth quarter, I think a lot of investors are talking about, hey, you know, The Home Depot really benefited from a warm winter. What\u2019s your thoughts on that and do you think the fourth quarter in effect pulled forward demand from the first half of this year?\nCraig Menear: Yes. It's really, really hard to gauge that. Clearly as we called out in the first quarter, we felt that there was some pull forward. It's really hard to know exactly how much that happens. Who knows what they -- whether in the upcoming fourth quarter will be, but we\u2019ll try to stay focused on driving the business.\nCarol Tome: And we know we had a large comp in the fourth quarter of last year that we have to comp on top of and we plan for that. We\u2019ll have a great holiday that, that we\u2019ll talk to you about next quarter.\nChristopher Horvers: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Next Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Research.\nScott Mushkin: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ve got three kind of quick ones.\nCraig Menear: Sure.\nScott Mushkin: I think the first one is, the 60 day terms, I think that you guys brought forward I think was in the last year beginning of this year for the Pro sales. Any quantification on what you think that's doing to your Pro sales, as you look at, I know you\u2019ve talked about strength there.\nCarol Tome: Right. So as we look at sales on our private label card particularly our commercial private label card, we\u2019re really pleased with the results. Sales are up year-on-year, ahead of our expectations. Our new accounts are up double digit ahead of our expectations. So it's still early days, we\u2019re only six months into the program. But we\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing. Now if I could zoom out a little bit and talk about our private label program in total, we actually saw a decline in penetration year-on-year of about 30 basis points, taking our penetration down to just under 23%. The decline was attributed to a decline in the consumer card. And when we peal back the layers of the onion to say, well what\u2019s happening with the consumer card? We see a few things. Last year we had key promotional events that we did not repeat this year. So that impacted the penetration. And then we see increasing competition coming from bank cards. In fact I received one just at my home this week from Visa that's offering deferred financing. So there\u2019s increased competition out there. And then finally and interestingly, we\u2019re seeing a robust penetration increase in PIN-debit. PIN-debit up over a 100 basis points year-on-year is now the third largest form of tender inside of our Company. So the first largest is the bank card, the second largest is the private label card and the third largest is PIN-debit.\nScott Mushkin: Interesting. Thank you. That's good information. Did you -- have you guys looked at when we through election cycles, kind of what -- we\u2019re obviously going to heat up the election cycle, and we\u2019ve heard that at the high-end, some high-end consumers are postponing certain purchases because of the election cycle. Have you guys looked at your numbers, and how does that flow through the Home Depot as we go through the fall?\nCraig Menear: To be totally honest with you, we\u2019re focused on our customer. We don\u2019t really pay a lot of attention to it. It's all about how do we take care of our customers every single day and make sure we\u2019re driving volume for them every day.\nScott Mushkin: All right. Then my last, and this one is definitely a random question, but it's our second year of Prime Day. Do you guys feel Prime Day as Amazon does it? And then I'll yield. Thanks.\nTed Decker: Interestingly on Prime Day there is so much activity in the market place. It draws a lot of shoppers online and our customers respond, and we have a good day dropping off Prime Day.\nScott Mushkin: All right. Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Budd Bugatch, Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch: Good morning and congratulations on a solid quarter. I guess, my first question has to do with the Interline integration. Maybe talk a little bit more or give us a drilldown and give us some color, of A; what\u2019s your doing, and B; maybe the impact on the economics of the company during the quarter?\nCraig Menear: So, Budd, we\u2019re again still working through the integration. We\u2019re kind of ahead of the value drivers. We\u2019ll likely see, but I\u2019ll let, Bill comment on that. He\u2019s here.\nBill Lennie: Budd, we talked a little bit last call, but our customer intercepts and research that we\u2019re doing in the prioritization of our used cases where it's based on really the customer feedback plus if you look at the market opportunity, and we have in pilot our first used case which is the ability to enable customers to shop Interlined assortments inside the Home Depot stores. We have a pilot of 20 stores. It's really early days, but our results are exceeding expectations or really three times expectation. So it's encouraging. It says that all of the assumptions there have the ability to increase Share of Wallet with the Pro, remain intact, and so look at -- and continue to focus on that. But again it is very, very early days.\nCarol Tome: And in terms of the impact on the quarter, as we talked about our top-line growth exceeded our comp sales growth because of the impact on Interline. We called out the impact on our gross margin. It did have a dilutive impact on our gross margin, which we more than made up for with productivity and supply chain, and vendor co-op and rebate. And then it does add more variability and expenses. So, if you look at our expense growth factor for the quarter, backing out Interline it was a little higher than 60%, as we expected. As we now anniversary the Interline acquisition moving into the third quarter, our expense growth factor is going to come more in-line with what we expected. And in fact, our expenses are under such good control, we were under our expense plan for the second quarter. We\u2019re taking our expense growth factor down from the year. At the beginning of the year we said it would be about 40% of our sales growth. We now think it's about 32% of our sales growth.\nBudd Bugatch: Okay. And my follow-up really has to do with appliances, a double-digit comp if I heard you correctly. Ted, how is that -- how sustainable is that? What\u2019s causing that? Do you see that advance in the market itself?\nTed Decker: Well, there\u2019s clearly some share opportunity in the marketplace that we purposely positioned our self for, so we continue to invest in expanding our appliance showrooms with the larger showrooms, we can put more display pieces on the floor. It allowed us to get a much broader showing of Whirlpool\u2019s offering as well as high-end brands like, KitchenAid. So we\u2019re just a lot more relevant in this space with a better offering.\nCarol Tome: And a double-digit comp in appliances meant 50 basis points of total comp growth for our Company.\nBudd Bugatch: Okay. And just quickly, just one follow-up, is Pro penetration, can you give us any comment on that as a percentage of sales?\nCarol Tome: It's hovering where it's always hovered around 40% of sales.\nCraig Menear: Right.\nBudd Bugatch: Thank you very much. Congratulations.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Michael Lasser, UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Craig, how long do you think that home improvement demand can remain decoupled from other elements of the economy, other elements of retail? I think, Carol, in her prepared remarks noted that some economic prognostications have been ratcheted down, but you\u2019re keeping your forecast for same store sales in place. So, how long do you think that this can be kind of an oasis within the broader economy?\nCraig Menear: Well, I think when you look at a few factors. First of all there\u2019s about 4.6 months of supply, average historical is about six months. So that certainly means there\u2019s opportunity as you go forward, that's also helping to keep home value appreciation going. And there is projections in the market out there from various sources that would say home value appreciation continues for the next couple of years for sure. And so, I think this is a tailwind that we see for the foreseeable future in the guidance window that we\u2019ve given.\nMichael Lasser: And if you look at some of the housing market that has gotten really hot, San Francisco, Miami. Are you seeing similar trends there or any sign that demand is starting to ebb out?\nCraig Menear: We don\u2019t really see any change.\nCarol Tome: We haven\u2019t seen any change. The fundamentals which, Craig, pointed out for housing and then the impact to home improvement are really, really good, and you go back to household formation. If the number of people in households were they drop to the 2000 plus, it would create 4.3 million new households. Now will they all go into single family owned households? No. But we serve both. We served owned households and we served rental households. So there\u2019s just a tremendous amount of talent that continues to support our business, and our business outlook through 2016 into 2017 for sure. If not \u201918, \u201919.\nMichael Lasser: And my follow-up question is on the implementation of comp along with change in your ordering algorithm that you implemented in the quarter. Did that have any impact on sales? Did it drag down sales at all? Did it have any impact on in-stock?\nCraig Menear: I mean, it's really hard to know. We really don\u2019t know. And the reason that we don\u2019t is, there is so many items candidly in the store that can be substituted. So, if we cause ourselves hurt in one item, it's very possible that a customer picked up another item. So it's pretty difficult to tell.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. Good luck with the second half of the year.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Seth Sigman, Credit Suisse.\nSeth Sigman: Thanks. Good morning. Great quarter, guys. I just want to follow-up one the last questions. So you exited the quarter with a pretty healthy trend. It sounds like the tone is positive on the demand outlook. Is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of the cadence of comp growth in the back half of the year, Q3 versus Q4?\nCarol Tome: Yes. The way that we built our plan and our forecast, is that the comps for Q3, and Q4 will be more or less the same, shouldn\u2019t see a lot of variability there. Now where you will see variability is on the expense growth factor. The expense growth factor will be higher in the third quarter than it is in the fourth quarter principally because of year-over-year comparison. For the full-year, the expense growth factor should be about 32% of our sales growth.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe just to dig in a little bit further. I mean, have you seen any major change in trends or the demand -- demand outlook exiting the quarter, like early in the third quarter here?\nCarol Tome: No, we\u2019re very pleased with our August results. Parts of the country obviously are flooded. We have a store closed in Louisiana, and we -- our heart goes out to the people who are impacted by that. But if you ignore that kind of activities, we\u2019re very pleased.\nSeth Sigman: Okay, got it. And then, one of the things that you guys talked about is the growth in units per transaction. I\u2019m just wondering, is there a change in trend there, and if so, like you think that's the result of some of the initiatives or is the comp position of the projects that are getting done right now maybe a little bit different like, how do you think about that trend?\nCraig Menear: I think that the units per transaction, this is about the third quarter now that, when you think of all the positive comps we\u2019ve had over the past several years, the units per transaction really didn\u2019t move that much. But for the last few quarters, we\u2019ve seen a healthy growth in units per transaction and it's really units in the larger ticket items. When you start to get into larger ticket items, you\u2019re looking at 40, 50, 60 even 70 items in a basket. So this is clearly a project, while appliance sale for example would help the average ticket, you\u2019re only looking at one or two items, the appliance and maybe some connecting hoses. But our project business remains very healthy, and the growth of that unit per transaction and units in things like lumber and building materials are very healthy for the business. So it speaks to Pro, and it speaks to project.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. That's great color. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Peter Benedict, Robert Baird.\nPeter Benedict: Hi, guys. Just following up on that, is there any historical perspective you guys can provide us with around this, units per transaction trend that you\u2019re seeing? How does the current metrics compare to any period in the past? And when you started to see an uptick historically, how long does that go on for? Is there any perspective around that you could help us with? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: The granularity in items per basket, our history is not so good. Our record keeping is not so extensive, but we can\u2019t really go back to prior periods. But what we can currently and this is, I think a really good new story in terms of the health of the Pro, is that while, the high spend Pros drove the outperformance, the gap between high spend Pros and low spend Pros is narrowing. And as that gap narrows, as we would expect that's a sign of health in this -- in the Pro space. So we would expect this trend in items per basket to continue.\nPeter Benedict: Okay, Carol thanks. That's helpful. And then just my one follow-up would be, just curious if you guys are seeing anything around mix shifts within categories, building products in particular? Any evidence of any trade-up going on or anything like that? Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Well, we\u2019ve continued to see trade-up, we talked about this the last several calls where we\u2019re looking at all our price points and again we had another quarter where our comp progression improves as we go up the line structure from good, better, best. And specific to Pro pricing, I\u2019d say the only callout would be lumber prices are on the move when you\u2019re starting to get some trade-off between plywood and OSV. Just as those prices get back elevated the more premium product in plywood there isn\u2019t as much of a gap in that product class.\nTed Decker: Clearly innovation is a driver to the customer stepping up in the line structure. When you provide new innovative products, people step in.\nPeter Benedict: Okay. Makes, sense. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Dan Binder, Jefferies.\nDan Binder: Thank you. I just want to go back to the comment you made earlier about the replenishment era. I was just curious if it was significant enough that it created any in-stock or in-stock issues or loss sales impact?\nCraig Menear: I mean, we definitely saw an impact in our in-stock position for about six weeks during the quarter, but clearly have recovered from that at this point.\nCarol Tome: And let\u2019s put that in perspective for you. We strived to have in-stocks of 99% or greater. As Craig pointed, we were six weeks under that goal, but the largest gap was 13 basis points. So it wasn\u2019t a major disruption, but because of our standards to be 99% or better, we felt it.\nCraig Menear: Yes. We missed our own expectations.\nDan Binder: Okay. Great. And then, you mentioned earlier that there was certain promotions you didn\u2019t repeat, causing the private label penetration on credit to come down a bit. I was just curious on that, if you could talk a little bit about your promotional posture, how you\u2019re thinking about promotions relative to the market both from big box online, anything you can share with us on that front that will be great.\nCraig Menear: I would say that we have really redoubled our efforts to focus on every day value for the customer. So we are increasingly focused on providing the best product with the best brands at the best prices everyday for all of our customers regardless how they pay.\nDan Binder: Okay. Last one for you if you could. Last year there was a willingness to take on some more debt for share buyback thus far you stuck to the $5 billion share buyback, is there a scenario where you could see the leverage increase a bit? I think you\u2019re still under that two times adjusted that EBITDA at this point.\nCarol Tome: We are around 1.8 times which gives us about $3 billion of borrowing capacity relative to our target. It's not our intent to let that borrowing capacity continue to grow. And as we have in the past, we\u2019ve opportunistically taken advantage of interest rates and availability to raise incremental shares and increase our share repurchases. So you should think about our past practice. It's something that we should continue in the future. But we like to guide based on what we know today. And what we know today is excess cash to buy back shares. And if we like to issue some incremental debt and buy back some additional shares, we\u2019ll let you know.\nDan Binder: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Brian Nagel, Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: My first question, I apologize it may be somewhat repetitive to some of the prior questions. But just to be clear and I think someone else mentioned, there\u2019s been a lot of noise out there with -- in retail sales lately from what other companies are talking about, and clearly we talk about weather. But as you look at the data, even more granular than what we discussed today. Is there anything -- are you seeing anything to suggest or anything to hint at a more cautious consumer environment, particularly in a bigger ticket type projects?\nCraig Menear: As we\u2019ve said, we are fortunate that we are in a space where the customer is willing to spend. That's clearly driven by the dynamics that exist in the housing market overall. And as Ted, called out, we had a strong performance in tickets above $900 growing 8.1% in the quarter, and driven not only by big ticket categories like HVAC and appliances but by the units per basket around the project business. So, it's very encouraging what we\u2019re seeing in that.\nBrian Nagel: Thanks. And then a follow-up Carol, on the expense leverage side. For a while now it seems that Home Depot continues to beat the expectations with regard to expense leverage. You mentioned that again today with, now the higher EPS guidance for the year. So maybe more color on exactly where this latest bit of beat is coming from? And as you look out, is there anything to suggest that at some point Home Depot could really have a more difficult time leveraging expenses or are there continued opportunities?\nCarol Tome: Well, we view productivity as a virtuous cycle in our business. And we are constantly looking out ways to drive productivity while ensuring that the customer experience is the best it possibly could be. Most recently, our HR team did a great job of renegotiating some contracts in support of our medical benefit programs for our associates. And that reduction has caused actually a cost out and with that cost out, our people cost are going to be as high this as we anticipated. That benefit will flow through into 2017, which is a good news story. And there are other examples of that, I won't bore you with all those examples, but there are other examples of where our team continues to go after large purchasing contracts to drive productivity and make sure that the experience is one that we want to deliver.\nBrian Nagel: Thank you and congrats again.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Scot Ciccarelli, RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I know you are guys are focused on everyday value, I know you already commented on that. But there was some noise in the quarter regarding maybe heightened promotional cadence around some of the competitors in your space. Is there anything to note from your vantage point regarding changes in the promotional environment?\nCraig Menear: I mean from time-to-time we see increases in promotional activity. We saw it certainly during the quarter, but we're focused on driving everyday value for our customers.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. So nothing of note. And then Carol, I know one of the things you\u2019ve talked about increasingly over the last couple of quarters is the aging housing stock in the U.S. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve started to come to any conclusions regarding how big of a driver or impact that could be on your business over time? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: We are doing more research in this regard, because we've never been in this place in our country, so we don\u2019t have any history to rely on. So we\u2019ve got more research to do. It actually makes us comfortable about our growth forecast as we go into '17, because when things start to break, you got to fix it. And we think it\u2019s a tailwind, but Scot, I don\u2019t -- I can't quantify it yet. Maybe we look at that research done and by the end of next quarter we can give you some more thoughts.\nScot Ciccarelli: That would be great. Thanks, guys.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Jessica Mace, Nomura Securities.\nJessica Mace: Hi. Good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nJessica Mace: My question is a follow-up on the supply chain. You talked about it being a work in progress. And you mentioned that COM system and some other factors, but I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more detail on the next milestones that we should be expecting and what that impact could be on the P&L? Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Sure. So we do view the supply chain as a an ongoing continue opportunity to optimize, the next big initiative in that is supply chain Sync and Mark Holifield is here. I will let Mark comment.\nMark Holifield: Yes, we're pleased -- as we\u2019ve mentioned, it is a work in progress. We continue to see opportunity to improve our in-stock, our inventory productivity, our logistics costs. Sync is the biggest initiative we\u2019ve going in that. Sync is currently in two thirds of our RDCs, 12 of our 18 RDCs, and we're handling about 60% of the cost of goods sold, the dollar volume that goes through there on the Sync initiative. From that we're seeing mainly improved transportation costs and smoother demand flow and we are working with our suppliers to continue to improve those benefits for all in the supply chain. So we will continue along that path until -- but we're not in a hurry. It's still early days and it's a multiyear initiative that we're pursuing there.\nCraig Menear: To put it in perspective between 2011 and 2015, on a cumulative basis, our supply chain has driven 68 basis points of gross margin expansion. So it's been very productive for us. We call that the productivity that we experienced in the second quarter and year-to-date we've had about 12 or 13 basis points of productivity. So, we continue to anticipate benefits coming on the gross margin line through the productivity in our supply chain and also there will be longer-term inventory turn benefits. We never want to go out of stock, but there will be longer term inventory turn opportunities.\nCraig Menear: And that really comes from shortening lead times.\nJessica Mace: Great. Thank you for taking the question.\nCraig Menear: Sure.\nOperator: We will go next to Greg Melich, Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich: Hi. Thanks. I would love to dig a little deeper into the digital online business. I think up 19%, still quite strong, but it is decelerating. Is that just the law of large numbers? Was there something given all the initiatives you\u2019ve whether it be Sync or supply chain changes or getting ready for BOFDS that\u2019s impacted that?\nCraig Menear: We don\u2019t look at it as a deceleration on a nominal dollar basis. We've now grown over $200 million for \u2026\nCraig Menear: 14 quarters.\nCraig Menear: \u2026 14 quarters. One change was the patio line structure I spoke about, we put more value product into the store that really sold incredibly well. And that took about 2, 3 points of comp of our online number. So we\u2019ve been running at that 20-ish, 20 plus for several quarters now growing the business $200 million a quarter.\nGreg Melich: Got you. And if you -- and just to make sure I got the numbers right, I think you mentioned 42% of online now is done through the stores and I want to make sure I got that right. And two, as you go to this Deliver From Store, how do you think about that in terms of how it could change the online business?\nCraig Menear: Yes, that\u2019s right. So, 42% of online orders are picked up in the store and 90% of returns are processed in the store and then one of the big benefits following the rollout of comp is we are now following with what we call BOFDS, which is Buy Online Deliver from Store. We\u2019ve always delivered from our stores. The difference now is you can execute the transaction online and pick much shorter delivery window for your delivery. We are in about 700 plus stores now with buy online deliver from store very early days. We will be finished with that rollout by the end of this year and we're seeing really nice pickup from our customers and reuse, particularly our Pros, who have used buy online deliver from store coming back and using it a second and third time. So we think that fulfillment number which is the 42% will grow when we include BOFDS deliveries in that number. It's just -- it's very early right now.\nGreg Melich: That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Shirlone, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: That will come from Laura Champine with Roe Equity Research.\nLaura Champine: Good morning. I wanted to dig a little deeper into what\u2019s going on with the Pro. Do you think that you\u2019re benefiting from the growth in the market, or are you actually taking market share with Pros? And then assuming you\u2019re taking share with Pros, do you see more strength with smaller Pros, larger Pros, what categories are you dominating that\u2019s driving that share gain?\nCraig Menear: I definitely think that the market in total at least when you talk to Pros, they\u2019re busier than they were a year-ago. So the market growth is certainly there. And when we look at the strength in our Pro categories, we believe based on all the data that we have or what we\u2019re taking share in those categories as well.\nCarol Tome: And if you think about it Laura, based on the census data, which is an [indiscernible] we grew share year-on-year. And since Pro outpaced DIY growth it had to be share coming from -- in the Pro space. So clearly the market is growing, but we\u2019re taking share at the same time.\nLaura Champine: Got it. And any comments on the strength of the smaller Pro versus the larger Pro?\nCraig Menear: Yes. What --- as I mentioned earlier, what we\u2019ve seen is a narrowing between the large spend Pro and the high spend Pro in terms of the rate of growth and that is a very healthy sign.\nLaura Champine: Got it. Thank you.\nCraig Menear: You bet.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you for joining us today. We look forward to having you join us on our next quarterly earnings call in November.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect at this time.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Diane Dayhoff, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear, Chairman, CEO and President; Ted Decker, EVP of Merchandising; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors, and as a reminder we would appreciate it if the participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up please. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Now before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Diane, and good morning everyone. Sales for the first quarter were 22.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.5% from last year, and our US Stores had a positive comp of 7.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.44 in the first quarter.  We are pleased with the start of the year. In the US, all three of our divisions posted positive comps in the first quarter, led by our southern division. And all 19 US regions and top 40 markets saw single to low double-digit comps in the quarter. Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it the 50th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth.  Our Canadian business also posted mid-single digit comps in local currency for a total of 18 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. While weather had somewhat of a positive impact on our business and certainly drove variability in demand the first quarter was not an early spring story; it was an execution in the core of the store story.  We continue to see broad based growth across our store, as both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro outpacing our DIY business in the US.  As Ted will detail, our customers continue to respond positively to our deep assortment of trusted brands, as we are the product authority for both our Pro and DIY customers. The Interline integration is progressing nicely. We continue to move forward on a number of exciting sales driven initiatives, and we have outlined a path to truly realize the value of the Interline acquisition and the total Pro opportunity over the next 18 to 24 months. We also continue to believe that blending the physical and digital channels in to a seamless customer experience which we call interconnected retail, provides a unique opportunity for us to expose the power of the Home Depot. This has been and will continue to be one of the central tenets of our company strategy and we will remain committed to the investments in our interconnected capabilities.  For the quarter, online traffic growth was double-digits and our online sales grew 21.5%. Investing in interconnected capabilities goes beyond our dotcom business, as we are also continuing to further invest to more effectively meet customers\u2019 demands for increased fulfillment options. The rollout of COM, our new customer order management system is on track to be fully deployed in our US Stores before year-end.  Following behind the COM rollout is the implementation of BODFS or Buy Online Deliver From Store. In certain markets where BODFS has been introduced the demand has been much stronger than we anticipated. This is a good problem to have, but it is challenging delivery capacity which we\u2019re working to address. We still expect BODFS to be full rolled out by the end of the fiscal year.  For the spring season, we are focused on further connecting our in-store and online experiences. We offered more expanded assortment of spring seasonal products online. We also leveraged our digital assets to more effectively target customers with a personalized message pertaining to relevant products and special buys. Additionally, we use digital media to highlight local in-store assortments to drive foot steps to our stores.  To ensure our stores were properly staffed for the busy spring selling season, we hired over 80,000 associates to meet the demand of these increased footsteps. We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain. The flexibility and nimbleness of our supply chain was especially evident in the quarter as we navigated spikey demand without sacrificing in stock levels.  We continue to see dividends from investments made in our supply chain in our in-stocks, inventory productivity, logistics cost and service to our stores and customers. Our BOSS via RDC capability which enables us to fulfill Buy Online, Ship to Store orders through our RDC network leverages both our inventory and our fulfillment channels. The cost savings of this initiative have been above our expectations in both our ship times and customer satisfaction scores continue to improve.  We\u2019ve made great strides with our supply chain over the past several years, and we continue to optimize our network with initiatives like supply chain Sync. While Sync is in its early days of a multi-year rollout, we are pleased with our initial results. Though it is early in the year, our view of the macro environment remains consistent. We believe that housing data indicates continued tailwinds for our business.  As Carol will detail, because of our outperformance in the first quarter versus our plan, we are increasing our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect fiscal 2016 sales growth of approximately 6.3% and diluted earnings per share of $6.27.  Today we have over 400,000 associates, and I want to close by thanking them for their hard work and dedication to our customers. In addition to serving our customers in our stores through Team Depot, our associate led volunteer force, our associates donated their personal time to complete more than a thousand projects and service to our local communities over the past 12 months.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig, and good morning everyone. We had a strong first quarter, driven by continued strength across the store, particularly with our Pro customers, and unseasonally warm February was followed by a more normal but wetter March and April. While weather positively impacted our sales performance in the first quarter, spring has not yet arrived in many of our markets.  In the first quarter, total comp transactions grew by 4%, while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Our average ticket increase was somewhat impacted by commodity price deflation, mainly from lumber and copper. The total impact to ticket growth from commodity price deflation was approximately 15 basis points. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our US sales were up 2.7% in the first quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our US sales were up 9.5% in the first quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were appliances, roofing, sheds and windows, all of which had double-digit comps. The departments that outperformed the company\u2019s average comp where appliances, tools, building materials, lumber, lighting, hardware, mill work and d\u00e9cor. Electrical, paint, flooring, indoor garden, Kitchen and bath, plumbing and outdoor garden had positive comps but were below the company average.  Pro heavy categories continue to show great strength, as we saw double-digit comps in fencing, pressure treated decking, boards, fasteners, doors and conduit. In addition, the core of the store continue to perform well and we saw strength in maintenance and repair categories across the country. Tool storage, commercial and industrial lighting, portable power, power tool accessories, hand tools and wiring devices had double digit comps in the quarter. The core categories including garage organization, laminate flooring, landscape lighting, final plank and wood flooring had comps above the company average. Our store associates did a great job executing our 8th Annual Spring Black Friday event and creating excitement in our stores. In particular, special buys around appliances, outdoor power and hardscapes were well received by our customers, resulting in double digit comps in those categories.  As Craig mentioned, the Home Depot is the product authority for both our professional and DIY customers. We have the deepest assortment of the leading programs in the market place. Many of these brands are billion dollar categories for us. Our Pros recognize our brand advantage and Pro sales outpace the company average in the first quarter.  We continue to use detailed analytics to help us balance the art and science of retail. In marketing we maintain our best-in-class creative and we are also optimizing our ad effectiveness with targeted digital marketing. We remain focused on leveraging customer data to build the right message at the right time for the right customer.  As we\u2019ve made strategic moves away from print and mass marketing to more targeted digital marketing, we have seen great results. Since 2010, our return on advertising spend has nearly doubled.  Now let me turn our attention to the second quarter. We continue to be the leader in the market place for innovation and value that save our customers both time and money. To maintain the momentum in our double-digit comp in pneumatics category, we are introducing the new Milwaukee Pneumatic Framing Nailer, which is the latest addition to the M18 FUEL line up. This high powered nailer is much faster than competing battery powered nailers saving our Pros time on the job site.  And new from [Duval] is the 20 volt Max Brushless Finish Nailer. This compact and light weight finish nailer has innovative features including depth adjustments and multi-functional LED lights to illuminate work pieces. These are great examples of innovative and exclusive products from trusted, best-in-class Pro brands.  For our DIY customers, we are excited about the new exclusive launch of Pergo Outlast Plus Laminate Flooring. This easy to install laminate is water resistant and uses SpillProtect24 technology, a proprietary coating that prevents water from seeping in to the floor. Outlast Plus Flooring allows customers to install laminate flooring in high traffic and water prone areas such as kitchens, bathrooms and mudrooms.  In addition to all the great new products, we are excited about our upcoming events. Our Thrill of the Grill Memorial Day, Fathers\u2019 Day and 4 of July events are right around the corner and we have an incredible line of the great values and special buys that help our customers enjoy this outdoor season [looking forward]. With that I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you Ted and good morning everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $22.8 billion, a 9% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands, versus last year, a stronger US dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately 196 million or 0.9%.  Our total company comps or same store sales were positive 6.5% for the quarter, with positive comps of 10.2% in February, 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Comps for US stores were positive 7.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 11.8% in February, 7.7% in March and 4.6% in April. We estimate weather-driven demand positively impacted our US sales growth by approximately $250 million. The variability and our comp sales performance during the quarter was due in large part to weather and to the timing of Easter this year versus last year. Our total company gross margin was 34.2% for the quarter, a decrease of 13 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors; first, as expected we had 25 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven by lower fuel cost and increased productivity.  For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 122 basis points to 20.7%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth along with great expense control.  For the year, we now expect our expenses to grow at approximately 35% of our sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.5%, an increase of 109 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the first quarter was $237 million, up $44 million from last year, due primarily to higher long term debt balances.  In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.5% compared to 34.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Recall that the effective tax rate in the first quarter of last year was favorably impacted by the settlement of a tax audit. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.44, an increase of 19% from last year.  Now moving to some additional highlights; during the first quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico and we ended the quarter with a store count of 2275, and selling square footage of 237 million. Total sales per square foot for the first quarter was $377, up 6.5% from last year.  Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter inventory was $13.2 billion, up $913 million from last year, reflecting both the impact of Interline and the seasonality of our business. Inventory turns were 4.8 times, up one-tenth from the first quarter of last year.  In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.45 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash, bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion.  Computing on the average of beginning and ending long term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 29.2%, 300 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2015.  Now turning our attention to the full year, while US GDP forecast had pulled back slightly since we built our 2016 sales plan, we continue to see strength in the housing market, with home price appreciation, housing turnover and helpful formation trending where we thought they would. Sales in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, not just because of favorable weather, but because of higher demand for many of our core product categories.  While we ordinarily don\u2019t raise our sales growth guidance so early in the year, we are going to roll forward some of our first quarter out performance, giving the underlying strength of the business. Further, the US dollar has weakened such that the current spot rate of exchange is now in line with the FX rates we used to build our plan. Because of this, we are going to a single point estimate instead of a range for our 2016 guidance.  From the high end of the guidance range we provided in February, today we are raising our sales and earnings per share growth guidance. We now expect our 2016 sale to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide out of [GAAP]. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 14.8% to $6.27. We thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Derek, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nSeth Sigman: In aggregate it seems like weather did help the quarter, and you talked about 250 million or so, can you elaborate on where you saw that benefit, and if that means you actually pulled some sales forward or do you think that\u2019s just incremental.\nCraig Menear: So obviously with a warm February, we had a great start to the year and we saw outdoor project business in the north very, very strong. The 250 million that we\u2019ve estimated, that is - it\u2019s kind of hard to understand exactly how much of that is pull forward, but that\u2019s - what we\u2019re estimating is the demand that we saw from the weather benefit, we think there is 40ish million or so seasonal product pulled forward. \nCarol Tome: And the rest of the outperformance was in building material categories like concrete and pressure treated lumber, so on and so forth. That really is weather driven demand. \nSeth Sigman: And just a follow-up there, does that 250 million consider that spring weather hasn\u2019t arrived in some markets as you alluded to, and would that be factored in to that number?\nCarol Tome: That\u2019s right. We think we pulled forward two spring related categories $40 million to $50 million. And as you know, I don\u2019t what you\u2019re setting Seth, but as you know in certain parts of the country spring has not yet arrived. So we\u2019re still anticipating a bang up spring quarter.\nSeth Sigman: And just one follow-up on the Pro initiatives here, the extension of credit earlier in the quarter. Can you just talk about how that\u2019s going and how incremental to the number this quarter that may have been?\nCarol Tome: Yes, we\u2019re very pleased with the new value proposition that we are offering on our private label card for our Pros. You\u2019ll recall that we are now offering 60 days to pay 365 day return and discounts at the fuel pump. What we\u2019re seeing with our Pros is great receptivity; new accounts are ahead of our sales plan which is great news. But Seth remember that we just rolled this out to all stores in January, so there was no measurable impact to the topline because of this, but we anticipate that to come. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Just want to clarify something, when we used the word pull forward and if we take the 40 million out, that seasonal. Just thinking about the other part that \u2018was pulled forward\u2019 maybe other projects getting done a little earlier, do we know statistically one to three month pull forward. These are projects that presumably could get done in other parts of the year. And where I\u2019m going is trying to think about how that could impact the second quarter versus others later in the year. \nCarol Tome: Well here\u2019s how we\u2019ve looked at this, we think there was 250 millionish of weather-driven demand. It\u2019s not all seasonal pull forward, this is just activity because of great weather earlier in the quarter, and we\u2019re not rolling that forward, because we anticipated that these were projects that would be completed later in the year and just got done earlier in the year. So we\u2019re not rolling that forward. It will bleed in to Q2, Q3, may be even Q4. \nCraig Menear: To you point, if somebody was doing a concrete project but maybe they had plan for the summer and they said, hey, look, the grounds not frozen in the north I can do it now, and they do it. It\u2019s hard to tell which quarters it\u2019s come from, but it\u2019s certainly probably the next couple of quarters.\nCarol Tome: So as we think about the shape of the year and this might help for modeling, we now think that the first quarter will be the highest comping quarter, as a result the first half will be slightly higher than the back half of the year, and if you look at the comps that we are projecting for Q2, Q3 and Q4, we expect them to be in the similar range, not a lot of difference in those comp numbers. \nSimeon Gutman: That\u2019s helpful. My follow-up on the online business, I think you mentioned growth of about 21.5%, anything different about the pickup in store percentage that changed and then your comments on the delivery strain maybe from delivering from store, is that because Home Depot is offering the customer the option of where they want the product from or that\u2019s your system that\u2019s choosing to deliver from store. \nCraig Menear: First of all a comment, the percentage of pickup is around 40% where the customer is choosing the option to pick up their items from homedepot.com in our stores. And as it relates to the delivery, we have piloted the delivery program for a while, we saw mid-single digit growth in deliveries with the pilot, when we went in to additional markets, markets like Atlanta for example. We saw a pretty substantial increase in the customer option to choose that delivery and we\u2019re seeing double digit growth in deliveries. \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll hear from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Carol, as you mentioned it\u2019s not typical for the company to raise its guidance after the first quarter, and you have seen strong first quarters in the past. So what\u2019s different about what you\u2019re witnessing in the business right now and inspire so much confidence for you to move estimates higher? \nCarol Tome: It\u2019s really the strength across the store, and as you know when we build our sales plan we use our directionally correct but imperfect sales forecasting model which is an economic driven model. We do not build market share gains in to our forecast. As we look at the performance in the first quarter, clearly there were some share shifts. Look at appliance, Ted called it out, appliances contributed 50 basis points of our comp growth in the first quarter. So we are confident with what we saw in the first quarter and what we\u2019re seeing early in May to roll forward the out performance of the first quarter.\nMichael Lasser: So you mentioned GDP forecast are a little lower, housing is about where you thought it was. So what\u2019s changed is you\u2019re gaining a little bit more market share than you originally thought. \nCarol Tome: We don\u2019t plan market share as you know, so we believe there were share shifts and that was confirmed by [NAICS] [ph] data that came out that shows that from a census perspective anyway we did grow share. The other thing that we must look at is housing and just from all sorts of things that are happening within the housing market that we haven\u2019t built in to our plan, but we find to be of interest. Here\u2019s the statistic, we\u2019ve seen home equity values increase 94% since 2011. How is that possible? Because home prices are up 25% and people have been continuing to pay down their mortgages. So there\u2019s a wealth affect that\u2019s occurring with home owners. And this wealth effect as we\u2019ve talked at length, if you feel like your home as an investment and no an expense you spend differently in your home, and you can [indiscernible] in our big ticket categories. \nMichael Lasser: And then my follow-up question is on the expense outlook, you\u2019re now expecting expenses to grow at 35% [indiscernible] sales. Is that all due to what happened in the first quarter, or do you expect there to be some expense [good guys] [ph] in the remainder of the year? \nCarol Tome: Well despite [indiscernible] plan considerably in the first quarter, our total expenses were actually $13 million under our plan. That was driven by lower utilities as you would expect because of warmer weather in February, but also we\u2019re not seeing the kind of pressure on medical as we had anticipated. So now for the full year, we anticipate that our expenses will be lower than our original plan, which is helping tick our expense growth faster down from what we have said at 40% to now 35%.\nOperator: And next we have Kate McShane with Citi. \nKate McShane: I wanted to follow up on the other question that was just asked. Just given some of the earnings that we\u2019ve seen so far for Q1 that the health of the US consumer I think is being called into question somewhat. So I wondered if you could beyond what you\u2019ve already mentioned just talk about the DIY business, and if there\u2019s any read through there to the overall take of the consumer, and just how much of the out-performance of Pro versus DIY is driven versus maybe the housing statistics versus your initiatives?\nCraig Menear: I would say that when you look at the strength of the business, it really comes across the board. We\u2019re really pleased with the mix of both transactions and ticket growth that we had, it\u2019s something we look for in terms of balancing the business. We see the consumer continuing to engage in big ticket sales with transactions above $900, growing at 9.5% in the quarter. So while our Pro business was strong, and we\u2019re pleased to see that, we\u2019re also very pleased to see the growth in our DIY business. So the balance is what really is, is what we\u2019re striving to achieve and we\u2019re seeing that balance across the store. \nCarol Tome: And again I go back to the housing data, the housing data suggest that home owners still like they have more value than they did before. Look at negative equity, homes with negative equity have dropped from 22% at the beginning of 2012 to now 8.5%. \nKate McShane: And then my second follow-up question is unrelated, I know you\u2019ve spent some time in the prepared comments talking about Buy Online Ship from Store, which I think you\u2019re rolling out by the end of the year. Just wonder if we could have more detail in terms of how much of your merchandise that program will address? Is it going to be eligible for everything that\u2019s online and in the store? How will we expect that to work by the end of the year?\nCraig Menear: It pretty much is almost everything we sell, whether its online or in store, we\u2019ll be eligible for delivery, and we\u2019ll leverage the supply chain network that we\u2019ve build out to do that in a most cost effective way using our RDCs as flow-through points for product that will come from our distribution points that a customer chooses to have delivered, so definitely a broad approach to the assortment that we carry. \nOperator: And Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research, your line is open\nScott Mushkin: I just wanted to go back to the Buy Online and Deliver From Store economics, trying to understand it a little bit more. Our research has suggested particularly the (inaudible) really want to do that. They don\u2019t really necessarily want to pick up in-store. I was just wondering looking at the uptake is exceeding expectations, what are the margins attached to that business. \nCraig Menear: First I would say that in our business we have a lot of project business. We have a lot of things that are big and bulky, and so that\u2019s why in many ways we\u2019re seeing significant portion of our customers chose to pick up their products in-store and then potentially have it delivered it from store. We also have Pros, who are interested in having the product deliver from store to their job sites. It saves them time, it saves the runners from to come in to the stores overall. And then candidly, we\u2019ve been doing delivery from store for quite some time, for years, and that\u2019s just part of the overall operating cost of doing the business, and so we approach that on a day in, day out basis as part of operating the business and our value proposition for the customer across product takes out a new account. \nScott Mushkin: So refresh my memory do you guys charge for that or is that not charged for?\nCraig Menear: Yes we do. We charge for it and there\u2019s options for tighter windows where there is a premium paid.\nScott Mushkin: And then I wanted to go into the credit changes extending from 30 to 60 days, and just try to understand a little bit more of the credit limits attached. I know you guys are using a bank to help you with that. What are your upper credit limits, and is there a thought of expanding that out and maybe just a little tutorial on that, that would be great. \nCarol Tome: Sure. Our private label credit card is underwritten by a third party and on I\u2019ll do some averages and talk to you about outliners. So for our commercial customers these would be our Pros. The average line of credit is $6600, which seems to adequately meet their needs, but we do have some higher spend Pros. So the third party underwriter will extend larger lines, and we have six [build through] lines to many of our customers who ask for those lines.  Furthermore, if there is a situation where the credit lines tighten up a bit, we have a second look program with another third person provider that will take a second look at the request and up the line of credit. So we have a number of tools in our toolkit to adequately provide the financing requirements of our Pros. The biggest tool is moving to 60 days, because if you think about it, we\u2019re providing working capital support for them. They are going to get paid by their customers before they have to pay us back. \nScott Mushkin: And I think you said there\u2019s some six figures out there. With the mix of the business are you anticipating that 6600 that you referenced going up meaningfully, and would you guys ever think of taking some of this on your own balance sheet or no?\nCarol Tome: We\u2019ll let the customers take us where they take us. We want to grow the Pro and if they need more credit, we\u2019re happy to force them in that effort. In terms of taking it on to our balance sheet, we love the arrangement that we have with our third party underwriter today. \nOperator: And moving on we\u2019ll next hear from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChris Horvers: Wanted to just at the risk of beating a dead horse so to speak, follow-up on California and the oil markets, we\u2019ve seen someone like Costco seen some variability in California and they sell a lot of food so it was a bit surprising to us. Are you seeing anything different in those markets that alerts you or causes any concern?\nCraig Menear: No, overall we\u2019re really not and the area that we watch most closely is Texas. We have 178 stores in Texas. Texas absolutely outperform the company average in the quarter. I think all major markets in Texas outperformed well. Texas clearly has diversified their economy more so over the past few years, which I think is a benefit. Clearly in western Canada we saw some pressure. As you might imagine not quite as diversified environment there. So we haven\u2019t really seen any major shift. \nCarol Tome: Actually in California Governor Brown just released some [water] restructuring, so we think that would be a good mark for our growing business. So our California business is doing quite well. We did have a pop-up store in North Dakota; we popped it up during the height of the [fracking] days. Chris we\u2019re popping that store down. \nChris Horvers: It\u2019s a big pop-up.\nCarol Tome: That\u2019s about the impact really. \nChris Horvers: Understood, and can you talk about any research that you\u2019ve done around millennials and household formation? Are they coming to form households now, do you think they will act like Gen X did before them and how do you think it impacts the long term outlook of the box and the online business?\nCraig Menear: We actually have done a fair amount of research here and it was part of our strategic planning last summer, where we had several groups of millennials work on what Home Depot looks like 8 to 10 years out as well. What our research tells us is that basically this is a delayed cycle, that the millennial generation has many of the same desires that generations prior to them have, we\u2019ve seen as household formation goes up roughly a third or so of those formations are happening with millennials at the tail end of that age group. It appears there\u2019s about a six year delayed cycle here. But our research indicates that in many ways they\u2019ll act the same as previous generations. \nCarol Tome: Yeah, the average age of new home buyers last year was 33 years old, that\u2019s the edge of the millennials. So that another proof of age that at some point they want to own a home. \nChris Horvers: Yeah, and then one last just clarification question, was there any impact in the monthly because of the Easter shift?\nCarol Tome: If we look at how we reported comps, and I\u2019m talking to the US now, March was reported was 7.7. If you shift it for like-for-like for April that comp would have been a 9.2. April was reported at 4.6, it would have been like-for-like 3.6. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays.\nMatt McClintock: I was wondering if we could ask a question on appliances. Thinking about the longer term opportunity within that category, particularly now that you\u2019re seeing other channels of retail that are maybe more challenged right now the department stores etcetera; looking at that as also a new growth opportunity, can you maybe just update us on your thoughts and maybe how those thoughts have changed now that you\u2019re seeing more competition in that category?\nCraig Menear: We haven\u2019t seen the impact of any increase competition in our [finance] business; it\u2019s extremely strong again in the first quarter and that it accelerated as we exited the quarter. We\u2019ve been leaning in to that space as you know, and we\u2019re going to expand the appliance square footage in to another 100 odd stores again this year. So we\u2019re very happy with the results, in fact certain markets some competitors entered the space. We saw significantly higher performance than rest of the country. \nOperator: And next question in the queue we have Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: So my first question with market share, anything as you look at the data to maybe comment to market share one way or the other, and particularly with what seemed to be somewhat of a volatile weather through the period did that impact market share trends at your chain within the channel through the quarter? \nCraig Menear: I don\u2019t think we really have any way of knowing if weather really impacted share. We\u2019re really focused on making sure that we\u2019re driving every day great value for our customers and trying to bring innovative products that solve problems for them. Ted I hope you have any additional comments, but --.\nTed Decker: No, again with the weather has been normal and in fact good are seasonal businesses, so the whole store has been performing and then the things tied more heavily to the consumer in outdoor gardening that has been extremely strong where we have good weather. So don\u2019t know yet if we would have taken any share there. And then right now April in the north and even now a day like today with a lot of rain, again we don\u2019t see great consumer outside sales. But again you don\u2019t know the relative performance at this point. \nBrian Nagel: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And the second question I have is bigger picture in nature, but one of the questions I get a lot from our clients is, here is Home Depot\u2019s put up great numbers now for a while and how much longer does this persist? And I know an analysis you had talked about it at your analyst meeting and said just to look at the productivity of the store, particularly by category, so maybe as a quick update there, as you look around the store and relative to historic peak levels if you will, where are still the biggest opportunities in the categories to drive increased productivity from here?\nCraig Menear: I would say that as we look at the business, first of all my starting comment would be, we\u2019re planning a $550 billion market all-in now with the addition of Interline and Plain in the MRO space for multi-family hospitality and institutional. And we own less than 20% of that in total. So we think there\u2019s lots of opportunity to grow.  We\u2019ve several initiatives underway and I have both Ann-Marie and Mark Holifield are here. I\u2019ll let them comment, but several initiatives underway to drive productivity as we move forward and coordinated effort between our supply chain and our store operations team. \nMark Holifield: This is Mark Holifield, we are very pleased with the supply chain Sink initiative. We\u2019ve got rolled pretty much in the southern tier of RDCs with a good deal of our dollar flow on that. One of the things that\u2019s going along with Sink is the floor load process where we\u2019re loading our product under the floor, where previously it was loaded on pallets, and that\u2019s driving tremendous productivity just filling trucks much more full as they depart for stores. So still rolling that out, so still lots of opportunity there. \nAnn-Marie: And in conjunction with that there is tremendous opportunity in the backend of the store. So as Mark talked about how to think, we also focus on getting this product to the shelf. And as we manage the flow of products in the stores, we then really engineer the backend to create a better streamlined process to get the product on the shelf and much quicker as well. So a ton of opportunities there, and in addition we have talked about Buying Online Deliver from Store. We\u2019ve also talked about Buy Online Ship to Store and all those are convenient experiences for the customer and we want to make sure that we lean in and show that we organize or labor round where the customers go in and create an efficient and effective process for them. \nCarol Tome: And if I could jump in, this sales productivity opportunity is to - as Craig said huge market to plan, lots of room for growth. But if you think about it from pick to drop, we still haven\u2019t fully recovered some of our category. So when I look at productivity still to be recovered special or kitchen, mill work, some of our building materials category still have room to recover from the peak. \nCraig Menear: The building material categories in lumber, mill work, those were still as Carol said off our \u201806 peak as we exited last year. And it was nice to see those were some of our strongest departments in the first quarter here in 2016. So it\u2019s nice to see larger project business under way. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.\nPeter Benedict: In the past you\u2019ve spoken to it\u2019s roughly 25% of your sales mix being in a bucket that you\u2019ve considered at risk of online competition, obviously that\u2019s a big topic right now. Is that still the right way to think about it, and can you give us any color may be on how the products in the bucket have performed relative to the rest of the box or how you\u2019ve been merchandising against that bucket?\nCraig Menear: Yeah, I would say in general, still a good way to think about it. If you think about those things that carry the highest level of risk would be those that are small package, reasonably high value, easy to ship product. So you think categories like power tools, faucets and so on. As Ted called out, we had a tremendous quarter as it related to tool sales. Quite candidly we\u2019re seeing both channels grow in these categories that represent that 25%. We\u2019re staying very focused on driving great value for our customer every day. \nPeter Benedict: And then Carol maybe just on leverage, is there a scenario where you would be comfortable revisiting that two times leverage (inaudible), what would need to happen for you to even consider something like that?\nCarol Tome: Peter as you know, our targeted adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 2. We\u2019re slightly under that, we\u2019re about 1.9 today. We like that too as a guardrail. It provides financial flexibility, but more importantly just we can sleep at night because we don\u2019t have too much leverage as a company, and so we like it.  Now it\u2019s not our goal to let that leverage ratio decline, and it will as we earn more. So as you\u2019ve seen us in the past, as the leverage point gets to a certain inflexion point and it infiltrates our selling and so forth, we will raise incremental debt. And you said that to support our share repurchase program. \nOperator: And next we\u2019ll hear from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nDan Binder: If we look at the comp store sales to the quarter, there was a little bit of deceleration which I suspect was weather related. I was just curious if you could comment on whether May has picked back up or seeing trends similar to April?\nCarol Tome: As I said earlier, one reason that we\u2019re confident with our ability to lift the sales for the year is what we\u2019re seeing in May. \nDan Binder: And then on the Pro business I know you said it was above the company average, and there is somewhat of an estimate in there. But just curious is the big gap between the DIY and the Pro business widening, stable or narrowing?\nCraig Menear: Not dramatically different. It was slightly stronger in the first quarter, I think we saw more outdoor project business which can have a tendency to be Pro related if you\u2019re doing things like concrete. \nDan Binder: And then lastly on the overtime proposal that\u2019s out there being reviewed, can you just comment on how Home Depot would be able to adjust if it becomes law?\nCraig Menear: We look at all factors when we put together our plans. Clearly we are aware that this was possible to come, that\u2019s factored in to our guidance. \nOperator: And Jaime Katz with Morningstar your line is open. \nJaime Katz: I\u2019m curious about lending standards, you guys have mentioned them in the past, and I\u2019m wondering if there have been any changes particularly if you have them by any sort of demographic. There have been a few articles out recently saying that millennials have had a more difficult time accessing the credit markets.\nCarol Tome: Well you can look at it through two lenses, first is just call it consumer credit, which may come through bank card or in our case through a private label card. We consumer credit asks are being approved 71% of the time. So that\u2019s a pretty good approval rate. Now I\u2019ll tell you if that was pretty high, its over 700. But that\u2019s a pretty good approval rate and also speak to the type of customers who are shopping inside of our store. And the approval rates of our Pro cards or Pro applicant is about the same. It gets [approval] 70% of the time.  Then you need to look at lending standards and for mortgages and lending standards are changing ever so slowly, it\u2019s like a glacier melting. And you can appreciate it why, because financial institutions have higher capital ratios, it\u2019s very hard to make a buck in this rather straight environment. So you can understand why its slow to move. But we\u2019ve factored that in as we think about where our business may go. And if there were to be easing, our underwriting standards for mortgages that would be good news, because the affordability index if you can get a mortgage the affordability index is something like a 170. That\u2019s awesome. So if you can get it approved, you can afford it. \nJaime Katz: Can you guys offer any commentary on any lessons you may have learned so far from Interline Brands or shared best practices you\u2019ve adopted into The Home Depot model? \nCraig Menear: The lessons learned would be that our anticipation that we have a customer who has come and made across both businesses would be a clearer learning. The desire for the customer whether it\u2019s an Interline customer to fill in and shop at The Home Depot and/or customers who are shopping in The Home Depot to have a desire to buy through Interline is there. We\u2019re pleased with it, I\u2019ll ask Bill if you have any other comments. \nBill Lennie: Jaime, Bill Lennie. I think Craig\u2019s exactly right, we\u2019re encouraged by the customer feedback and the advantages they see when we combine Interline and Home Depot. And then the second thing that we\u2019re pleased with is the collaboration we\u2019re seeing within outside sales organization and our ability to join forces and sell across the end markets. \nOperator: And next we have Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank\nMike Baker: Just one or two may be even three follow-ups. One, just to clear on the guidance are you raising the full year guidance because of currency being less burdensome and what you saw in the first quarter? Are you also changing and raising the second, third or fourth quarter guidance or is all the increase just because of what we saw in the first quarter and currency?\nCarol Tome: Mike the increase is solely related to the outperformance in the United States. The reason that we are no longer providing a range is that the exchange rate that we use for our plan are now about the same as the current spot rate. So no need to provide a range, but we\u2019re just rolling forward our performance except for weather driven demand. We are rolling over the rest of the outperformance. \nMike Baker: So no real change in how you would have thought about the second, third and fourth quarter?\nCarol Tome: That\u2019s right. \nMike Baker: Two others; one, Easter so if I understand it, so Easter hurt March, helped April, that\u2019s because of the store - people don\u2019t really shop on Easter. But I would\u2019ve thought that would have been outweighed by people shopping before Easter to do some outdoor projects, but that\u2019s not the case. Easter hurts March and it helped April to shift, did I understand that correctly?\nCarol Tome: Easter is not a big selling day for the Home Depot.\nMike Baker: But again the sales around Easter don\u2019t offset that I suppose?\nCarol Tome: No, they don\u2019t. \nCraig Menear: You\u2019ll lose if we (inaudible).\nCarol Tome: Because it\u2019s a weekend in spring, but again it did impact the (inaudible).\nMike Baker: Right understood. And then one last, this is maybe a bigger picture question. But it sounds like you think some of the housing trends are favorable and we agree with that. One thing you look at as an important metric and we agree again is that home price appreciation. But home prices are now pretty close to where they were in 2006, if we think about as the peak year. So how do you think about that? Are we concerned that there\u2019ll be less home price appreciation and then therefore less of a driver to your business?\nCraig Menear: I think the way we\u2019d look at it and the important factor is, is when home values are positive it\u2019s a good thing for our business. Clearly the customer knew to recover the value of their homes. We\u2019ve seen that recovery obviously take place and improve for a large portion of customers. But as long as home value stay positive it\u2019s a good thing. For years and years home value has grown on an average in the low single digit 1%, 2%, 3%. \nMike Baker: And in your view as we are now back towards peak year, your view is that that home price appreciation can continue?\nCarol Tome: We factor that in to our longer term forecast, and now this year we believe home prices will be up around 5%. It\u2019s important to note that if not fully recovered even with that 5% and it\u2019s certainly different in different parts of the country. So if we take 5% this year and then we take next year maybe 3%, the year on after that, and so it continues to crack the point because it is just ongoing home price appreciation. \nDiane Dayhoff : Derek we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Absolutely, our last question for today comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. \nDennis McGill: Just a couple of quick ones; Carol, on the cash flow can you just refresh how we should think about cash flow drop down for the year and working capital as you work through the year?\nCarol Tome: Yeah, so we think we\u2019ll generate around $10 billion of cash from the business this year. That includes a slightly improvement in working capital principally in inventory turnover. We\u2019re planning to take our inventory turnover up by [10] in 2016. \nDennis McGill: And then the share transaction that\u2019s greater than $900, you\u2019ve talked about that as around 20% of late. Where did that peek out in the last cycle?\nCarol Tome: Where did it peak out in 2006?\nDennis McGill: Just so the sign of big ticket share. \nCarol Tome: I don\u2019t know. I have to go look at it. I\u2019m not even sure we did that (inaudible). \nCraig Menear: I don\u2019t know that we did in 2006, but I can tell you that for the last seven or eight, maybe seven years it\u2019s been pretty comparable to that. And I think the other factor to consider is when we look at 2006 and look at kind of peak performance, in our own minds we\u2019re not sure what the peak really was, because in 2006 we actually had negative transactions. We were firing customers. And so we don\u2019t know that we actually - we assume we didn\u2019t actually peak in 2006 the way we should have. \nDiane Dayhoff: Well, thank you for joining us on our call today, and we look forward to discussing quarter earnings results in August.\nOperator: And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

And so Diane we wish you all the best in retirement.\nDiane Dayhoff: Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Fiscal 2017 was another record year for our business and we achieved the highest sales in net earnings in company history. Fiscal 2017 sales grew $6.3 billion to $100.9 billion and an increase of 6.7% from fiscal 2016, while diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $7.29. Sales for the fourth quarter were $23.9 billion up 7.5% from last year. Comp sales were also up 7.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.2%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.52 in the fourth quarter. We continue to see broad-based growth across the stores and our geographies. All three of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps in the fourth quarter, but we did see more variability in regional performance than we have in several quarters due to weather. Internationally, both Mexico and Canada posted another quarter of positive comps in local currency. While sales did benefit from hurricane recovery efforts, we also had hurricane related expenses. Our merchants, store teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter both in stores and in and online. As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter and we saw a growth in both pro and DIY categories. Pro-sales once again outpaced DIY sales in the quarter as the work that we\u2019re doing to enhance service capabilities for our pros continue to resonate. We were pleased with the growth of sales to our DIY customers who also gave us a likelihood to shop again score of 86% up almost 150 basis points from last year. Our interconnected business made great strides in 2017 as the team continued to enhance our digital assets to enable a more seamless experience for our customers no matter how they choose to shop with us. We implemented a new e-commerce platform, enhanced our search and mobile functionality, increased check out speed and expanded chat functionality to improve the customer experience with our online contact centers. We continue to invest in our digital properties and it has increased traffic and conversion. Versus prior year, our online sales grew 21% in the fourth quarter and 21.5% in fiscal 2017, now representing 6.7% of our total sales. While we are seeing significant growth in our online sales, these online shoppers see the relevance of our stores as approximately 46% of our online U.S. orders are picked up in our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. We have talked a lot about the progress we have made in building our upstream supply chain network over the past several years. We\u2019ve also told you about the 1.2 billion investment we plan to make over the next five years to leverage the capabilities and competitive advantages that we have in our upstream network, while significantly improving our downstream proficiencies to leverage our scale in convenient locations. This year we will pilot the local flatbed DFCs and market delivery operations, but I want to remind you that this investment in one Home Depot supply chain is a five year journey where the financial benefits won\u2019t be realized until the initiative is complete. These investments are critical to meet the evolving needs of our customers and we are committed to creating the fastest most efficient delivery network for home-improvement products. But we are not an organization that rests on our laurels of previous accomplishments. I don\u2019t want to miss this opportunity to applaud each and every one of our associates for the incredible work that has brought us to this point in our company\u2019s history. As I mentioned, fiscal 2017 was a record sales and earnings year on the heels of a record fiscal 2016. In 2017, our associates and suppliers served our customers during their time of need as we navigated the disruptions caused by various natural disasters. We also welcome two new teams to the Home Depot family, through the acquisitions of Compact Power and The Company Store. All of this was accomplished during a time marked by a high degree of change in our business as we respond to the rapidly evolving retail environment. As they always do, our associates continue to adapt to these changes, while consistently delivering outstanding customer service. Today, our Board announced a 15.7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.03 per share. We remain committed to maintaining disciplined capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. Turning to 2018 and beyond, I\u2019m very excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us. Carol will take you through the details, but we expect 2018 to be another year of growth with expected sales growth of approximately 6.5% and diluted earnings per share of approximately $9.31. At our investor conference in December, we outlined our three-year financial targets and an accelerated investment plan to create the one Home Depot experience for our customers. Today we are reaffirming our investment strategy in our 2020 targets to grow sales as high as $120 billion with operating margin as high as 15% and we are updating our return on invested capital target to now more than 40%. One of the areas that we are investing in is our associates, and in the fourth quarter we did just that. We recognize associates through success sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. For the second half of the year, 99% of our stores qualified for success sharing. Beyond success sharing, we were pleased to be able to pay out an incremental one-time bonus to our hourly associates in light of tax reform. Together, this was an investment in our associates of more than $240 million in the back half of the year. I want to close by thanking all of our associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. We look forward to continuing this momentum in 2018 and with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nEdward Decker: Thanks Craig and good morning everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter where sales exceeded our expectations. We saw strength across the store led by our pro customer and our online sales continued their double-digit growth. Looking at our departments, lumber, electrical, and tools had double-digit comps in the quarter. Appliances, plumbing, and building materials were also above the company\u2019s average comp. Decor, flooring, millwork, paint, indoor garden, hardware, outdoor garden, and kitchen and bath were positive, but below the company average. Lighting recorded a low single-digit negative comp primarily due to LED price deflation. In the fourth quarter, we saw a growth in both ticket and transactions. Comp average ticket increased 5.5% and comp transactions increased 1.9%. Commodity price inflation in lumber, building materials and copper positively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 105 basis points. Foreign exchange rates also positively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 42 basis points. Big ticket sales in the fourth quarter or transactions over $900 which represent approximately 22% of our U.S. sales were up 9.8%. The increase in big ticket sales was driven in part by strength in vinyl plank flooring, fencing and appliances. Transactions for tickets under $50 which make up approximately 16% of our U.S. sales grew by 0.8% in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we saw strong sales with both our DIY and pro-customer. Sales for our professional customers grew double digits in the quarter. Pro-heavy categories, lumber, pressure-treated decking, insulation and gypsum all had double-digit growth during the quarter with solid unit productivity. Our paint initiatives continue to gain traction, as we saw strong sales to both our pro-and DIY customers throughout the quarter. Turning to our DIY customers, we saw a terrific response to our events throughout the quarter. Traffic was strong both in-store and online during our Black Friday gift center and holiday events. During the quarter, our DIY customers drove strong comps, in power tools, hand tools, rugs, appliances and decorative holiday. We also continue to see strength in storm related categories in the quarter with double-digit comps and generators, wet dry vac\u2019s and portable heating. This part of our focus on balancing the art and signs of retail, we continue to refine and localize our assortments. Recent examples with our heart skates category, which includes pavers, wall block and landscape rock. We are leveraging the power of our clustering and space optimization tools to assign assortments and facings at the local store level. As a result, we have been able to optimize on shelf inventory levels to provide job [ph] block quantities for our customers, minimize shelf maintenance for store associates and maintain a meaningful innovative assortment. Initial results of warm weather markets have been strong. Now, let me turn our attention to the first quarter. Product innovation and speed to market allow the Home Depot to maintain its position as the number one retailer in product authority and home-improvement. To that end, our merchants are constantly collaborating with our suppliers to deliver new products exclusively to the Home Depot. For example, we have recently updated our assortment of Klein tools for professional electricians. This includes the new 9-inch Journeyman Diagonal Cutting Pliers that provide 57% more cutting surface and new magnetizer tool that is great when needing to magnetize a screwdriver or bed. The addition of these new products to our existing assortment of bit box exclusive Klein tools keeps us winning with the electrician. With spring quickly approaching we are gearing up to fulfil the needs of our customers as they complete their outdoor projects and get ready to enjoy the warm weather. In addition to our annual spring Black Friday event, we are excited about our new patio set offerings which provide customers great value across a wide selection to fit their specific style and needs. New this year is part of our exclusive Hampton Bay collection we are offering cushion guard technology, which guarantees water repellency as well as protection from fading and stains. This gives our customers peace of mind and reassurance that they are purchasing quality material at an everyday low price. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, total sales were $23.9 billion an increase of 7.5% versus last year a weaker U.S. dollar positively impacted total sales growth by approximately $100 million or 0.5%. Additionally, we estimate that hurricane-related sales positively impacted total company sales growth in the quarter by 1.7% or $380 million. Our total company comps or same store sales were positive 7.5% for the quarter, with positive comps of 8.3% in November, 11.5% in December and 3.1% in January. Comps, pre rep stores were positive 7.2% for the quarter with positive comps of 8.2% in November, 11.4% in December and 2.5% in January. Our monthly comps were distorted by the timing of Christmas. This year, the Christmas holiday fell in our fiscal January rather than December. Adjusting for this timing shift, our total company comps would have been 8.3% in November, 8.5% in December and 5.8% in January. For fiscal 2017, our sales increased 6.7% to $100.9 billion and total company comp sales were positive 6.8%. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 6.9%. During the year, foreign exchange rates positively impacted total sales growth by approximately $67 million or 0.1%. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.9% a decline of 12 basis points from last year. We attribute the March decline in our gross margins primarily to lower margin hurricane-related sales. For the year, we experienced 11 basis points of growth margin contraction in line with our plans. In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 30 basis points to 20.5%. Our expense leverage was driven primarily by our strong sales performance. During the quarter, we had a few expenses that we did not plan. First, as a result of the one time cash bonus stemming from tax reforms, we incurred approximately $170 million of incremental expense, and we incurred approximately $66 million of hurricane-related expenses. Fiscal 2017 operating expense as a percent of sales was 19.5%, a decrease of 47 basis points from last year. For the year our expenses grew at approximately 63% of our sales growth rate. Ignoring hurricane-related sales and expenses and backing out the onetime bonus, our expenses grew at approximately 45% of our sales growth rate in fiscal 2017. Our operating margins for the fourth quarter was 13.4% and for the year, was 14.6%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter grew by $11 million to $246 million, reflecting for the most part a higher long-term debt balance versus last year. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 39.6% compared to 35.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a net tax expense of approximately $127 million resulting from tax reform. While this is a provisional charge it was slightly better than our initial estimate. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.52, an increase of 5.6% from last year. For the year, diluted earnings per share were $7.29 an increase of 13% compared to fiscal 2015. Our fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by approximately $0.17 due to the onetime bonus and net tax expense previously mentioned. Now moving onto some additional highlights. During the fiscal year, we opened six new stores including three in the U.S. and three in Mexico, for an ending [Ph] store count of 2,284. Selling square footage at the end of the year was 237 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per square foot increased 6.7% to $417, the highest level since fiscal 1999. At the end of the quarter, merchandised inventories were $12.7 billion up $199 million from last year. Inventory turns were 5.1 time up from 4.9 times last year. Moving onto capital allocation, in fiscal 2017 we generated approximately $12.3 billion of cash from the business and used that cash as well as proceeds from $3.3 billion of both short and long term debt issuances to invest in the business, repurchase our shares and paid dividends to our shareholders. During the year, we invested approximately $2.3 billion back into the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions. Further, we repurchased approximately $8 billion or about 49.5 million of our outstanding shares including roughly $2.1 billion or 11.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. Finally, during the year, we paid $4.2 billion in dividends. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 34.2%, 280 basis points higher than the end of fiscal 2016. Today\u2019s press release includes our guidance for fiscal 2018 and I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP so fiscal 2018 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2017. There are a few things to keep in mind when thinking about our fiscal 2018. First, fiscal 2018 will include a 53rd week, so the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 will consist of 14 weeks. We will continue to report comps on a 52-week basis but we will base our overall guidance on 53-weeks. Second, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we will adopt ASU 2014-09 which addresses revenue recognition. This accounting standard will not have a material impact on our sales or our operating margin, but it will change the geography of certain items on our income statements. Our guidance today does not incorporate this new standard. We will give you a more detailed update during our first quarter conference call in May. Finally, our guidance incorporate the investment plans we laid out in December and the impact of tax reform, so with that, let\u2019s zoom out and look at the macro environment. The U.S. economy is strong, and tax reform is net positive for the housing industry. We expect higher job growth, higher income growth, and yes, higher mortgage rates. But with that comes higher home price appreciation and rising housing demand, which should drive home improvement spending. For fiscal 2018, we expect sales to grow approximately 6.5% with the extra week adding approximately $1.6 billion in sales. During fiscal 2018, we expect total company comp sales of approximately 5% and we\u2019re planning to open three new stores. For fiscal 2018, we are projecting our gross margin to be about the same as it was in fiscal 2017, reflecting for the most part the benefit of the extra week. As we discussed during our December Investor Conference we have a number of investments plan which will cause our expense growth factor to be higher than when it's been in the past. Further, with tax reform we have elected to pull some of the investments forward into fiscal 2018. We expect our 2018 operating expenses to grow a little more than a 100% of our sales growth rate. For the year, we expect that our operating margin will be approximately 14.5% with the extra week adding approximately $300 million in operating profit. For fiscal 2018, incorporating tax reform we estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately 26%. We expect fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 28% to $9.31 with the 53rd week contributing approximately $0.19. Our earnings per share guidance include our plan to repurchase approximately $4 billion of outstanding shares during the year. For the year, we project cash flow from the business are roughly $14.1 billion, which includes about $1.8 billion of cash resulting from tax reform. We will invest $2.5 billion of this cash back into the business in support of the strategic initiatives we outlined at our investor conference. We will also use this cash to pay $4.8 billion of dividend. As Craig mentioned we just announced a 15.7% increase in our quarterly dividend which equates to an annual dividend of $4.12 in line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 55% of earning. Finally, we will repurchase $4 billion of outstanding shares. Note that this is a preliminary share repurchase target and may be adjusted throughout the year. At our Investor Conference in December we shared with you our long-term financial target and our strategy to create One Home Depot. Over the next three years we will nearly double our investments into the business to enhance the customer experience, invest for the future and create value. Today we are reaffirming and updating our long-term targets. By fiscal 2020, we are aiming to grow our sales to a range of $115 billion to $120 billion with an operating margin of 14.4% to 15%, reflecting the impact of tax reform and a resulting higher net operating profit after tax. We now believe our return on invested capital for fiscal 2020 will be more than 40%. So, we thank you for participation in today's call. And Abby we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations, Diane. My first question is on the topline in the fourth quarter. You were cycling two warm winters and I realize the hurricane was some benefit in the quarter, but if you look at the underlying run rate of the business, is there anything to glean \u2013 like did the business \u2013 or the fact that some of these categories were still hanging in despite you had more normalized weather, does that mean we should see an even stronger spring when we get there?\nCraig Menear: I think overall, we are first of all very pleased with the performance in the quarter both across categories, as well as geographies. To your point, we definitely had benefit from hurricane recovery sales partially offset by actually a real winter in January this year. Carol, you might want to share just how we\u2019ve made up the fourth quarter.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. So we were really pleased with the result in the fourth quarter. Clearly, the hurricane sales were higher than what we had included in our guidance at the end of third quarter, so we were pleased with that. But the business, just the underlying business was very strong. As Craig pointed out, we had winter. And if you look at the month of January alone and the comps across our division, the comp in the western division and the southern division in the month of January was higher than the comp for the company for the quarter. Now in the north where we had real winter and I think you experienced that winter, our comp was low single digit as you expected. So what does that mean? We should have a great spring, I would think when you have a normal winter.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then my second question, looking at the housing market in total and then maybe looking at the market color that you guys have. In more mature markets where the housing market has already recovered. Can you talk about any trends good and bad? And then alternatively in less mature recovery market anything that you\u2019re seeing that\u2019s encouraging about the pace of sales in those markets?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. So as Craig mentioned, if you look at the variability in our regions, the spread was a bit wider than we\u2019ve seen in the past several quarters, but that\u2019s because of the hurricane-related sales where we had high, high double digit comps. But if you ignore the hurricane-related sales you actually see the variability tightening. And that\u2019s actually because the economic environment in the cities that have recovered is robust, and there\u2019s a housing shortage. So let\u2019s take a look at San Francisco for example. San Francisco is very robust. The month of supply in San Francisco [Indiscernible], so we continue to see strong growth there. In areas at the countries that haven\u2019t fully recovered, well, good news there too. So, housing as an asset class across the country continues to look very good.\nCraig Menear: I think one other comment on that. If you look at a market like Dallas which has had tremendous growth in home value appreciations, the affordability index is still terrific, so we\u2019re looking at housing continue to be tailwind for us.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: Congratulations, Diane. So, I want to just go over quickly on Simeon\u2019s question on hurricane. So, if we look at the cadence for the business over the last couple of quarters, it seems like you actually got a bigger benefit from the hurricanes here in the four quarter, which was little surprising to us. Any new insights as we\u2019re watching these sales come through as to how long these benefits persist into 2018?\nCraig Menear: So overall the fourth quarter was almost comparable to the third quarter in terms of total benefit which as Carol mentioned, fourth quarter was slightly stronger than what we had anticipated. When we look at the go-forward in the business for 2018, we expect the sales from hurricanes to be somewhat comparable to what we experienced in 2017 overall, and most of that coming in the first half of the year.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Right. So just to put the numbers behind that we believe we had $652 million of hurricane-related sales in the back half of 2017. And we expect to have that same number of sales in 2018. The difference of course is that the 2018 sales will be a little bit more profitable than what we experienced in 2017, in fact when you add it all up we lost money on those sales. We lost about $11 million on those sales in 2017 and expect [indiscernible] a little bit of money on those sales in 2018.\nBrian Nagel: And then my follow-up question, Carol, you mentioned in your prepared comments just the \u2013 pull forward a bit in the cadence of investments that you laid out in the Analyst Day, now that the tax legislation was just passed. Any more color on specifically what investments you\u2019re pulling forward earlier? And then, how should we think about \u2013 with that, the potential return on those investments?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, happy to. So let me just give you a breakdown of our expense growth factor guidance for 2018. Our core expenses will grow at about 45% of our sales growth next year. We add to that then about 10% related to acquisition. As we\u2019ve talked in the past, our acquisitions have more variable expenses than our core. So when you add core in acquisitions, expenses growing at 55% of our sales growth. Then the investments that we\u2019re making add another 46 plus, so our expenses will be a little more than 100% of our sales growth in 2018. What are we pulling forward? Well, if you remember the pie chart that we shared with you at our Investor Day and we\u2019ve showed buckets of expense, one of the buckets of expense was a bucket called other. And in that bucket called other were people expense. So we are pulling forward some of those people expenses, because those are easy things to do. Some of the other investments that we\u2019re making, it takes time. Well, like we\u2019ve talked to you about supply chain as an example, our supply chain initiative is actually a five-year initiative, but the people investments are things that we can pull forward and we think that\u2019s the right thing to do.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. Thank you very much. Congrats again.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMike Baker: Hi. Thanks. Two questions. One, can you explain the calendar shift in a little more detail, December versus January. How does Christmas end up in January? And then I guess related to that, even when you make that adjustment, January does seem to have been a little bit softer, but is that just the winter weather?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. So, Mike, it\u2019s just our accounting convention. We have a four, four, five close and it\u2019s just when Christmas day falls. And Christmas this year was a Sunday or Monday. Anyway, it just fell into another month. So it just calendar. That\u2019s all it is. In terms of our January comp, yes, even on an adjusted basis it was lower than the previous two months, but we had a winter in January as I mentioned. Our western division, our southern division in the month of January comped higher than the company average for the quarter, but we can get a sense of were those comps were very good, but in the north where we had winter it was low single digit.\nMike Baker: Right. Okay. That makes sense. One follow-up, rates doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s an issue yet, but I think in the past you\u2019ve given some color on, where is that sort of break point where we start to become worried about rates either measured on a 10-year bond or 30-year fixed mortgage or however you look at it?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. So 30-year rates today are 4.2%. The consensus estimate for 2018 is 4.3%. I have seen a high estimate out there of 4.6%. But just to put it into perspective, our math suggests that for every 25 basis points of mortgage rate increase it\u2019s $40 of additional mortgage interest per month. So we don\u2019t see any concern with the rising interest rate over the next several years actually. Remember that historically [Indiscernible] mortgage is 5.6%, and as Craig commented the affordability index broadly speaking is still very good at over 155%.\nMike Baker: Okay. Very good. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations, Diane. As we look out over the course should we expect to see the composition of your same-store sales change at all particularly as you make more e-comm investment and your e-comm mix just comprise the bigger percentage of the total? Or as you\u2019ve said in the past should we expect half coming ticket and half coming from traffic?\nCraig Menear: We still look at it on a split of roughly 50-50 overtime coming from ticket and traffic overall. And from departments we still have opportunity in larger ticket building materials, special-order kitchens, lumber, while lumber has certainly run-up in price, the project is still growing and we still have significant opportunities, so from a department perspective we\u2019d see continued growth in those apartments.\nMichael Lasser: And Ted, is there any thing to read into about the performance of the lighting category. The price deflation in LEDs has been happening for a long time. Could it be now that, that category has just reached either a maturity point or it's now starting to shift more online?\nCraig Menear: Now, we\u2019d see the price deflation continuing into 2018 and we planned for meaningful deflation that continues throughout 2018.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: There\u2019s some good news with price deflation, because we are re-lapping our stores with LED light. And it was a good thing that we\u2019ve waited for this investment because the cost curve is coming down. So glass half full here.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSeth Sigman: Thanks a lot and good morning, and nice quarter, and of course Diane, congrats. I just want to follow-up on the gross margin outlook for flattish in 2018. I\u2019m wondering if you can reconcile that with the longer term guidance that calls for, I think it was a decline of 40 basis points over the next three years. And related to that presumably freight and mix could still be headwinds as you look into 2018. What do you assuming as other offsets in there? Thank you.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. So we\u2019ve guided gross margin flattish for the year. That includes the 53rd week. The margin in that 53rd week will be higher because it doesn\u2019t have as much fixed cost allocated to it. So if you ignored the 53rd week the gross margin for the business would be down call it seven-ish basis points. We have factored into our outlook a tightening transportation market, higher fuel costs, although that's gotten better recently. We\u2019re going to have to stay lose of this. So we\u2019ve got of cost out opportunities that we will certainly drive. But the transportation market is tightening. So we might little pressure there, but we\u2019ll manage through it.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. And then a question on the delivery from store initiative, I think it\u2019s been in the stores for over a year now. Can you speak about the performance, the types of Pros that are utilizing it? And if you're seeing actually new customers come in or is it just driving share of existing Pros wallet? Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Sure. Seth, I\u2019ll comment. We\u2019re very pleased actually with the growth overall into February and we\u2019re seeing that happened with our Pro and with our consumer and Mark is here, I\u2019ll let him comment.\nMark Holifield: Yes. We\u2019re seeing the same kind of mix of Pro in consumer that we see across the business. We\u2019re very pleased that that store-based delivery continues to grow. One highlight there we\u2019re continuing to roll out the car and van, lower-cost delivery options to more markets as we go including our home market of Atlanta now, so expect to have that rolled by spring to all the major markets.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And the question always is incrementality and based on our analysis for driving incremental growth here.\nSeth Sigman: Very helpful. Thank you. Good luck.\nMark Holifield: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatt Fassler: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Diane, thanks so much for all your years. And Isabel, welcome back to you. I want to start with quick follow-up for Carol, you gave the adjusted comps on a monthly basis for the total company. You have the Jan \u2013 do you have December and January numbers for the U.S. stores alone?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. 300 basis points shift. So you can just do that math.\nMatt Fassler: Great. My next question, if you talk about the transactions under 50 bucks. I mean, I used to just point to the bigger ticket transactions growing at or close to double digit and the smaller ticket transactions growing low singles. Are those transactions being subsumed by -- in other visits i.e. the visits coming down and that just reflected in the bigger ticket? Is it a question of market shares or the question of that business being done online? How would you -- how should we think about that trend in the small ticket business?\nCraig Menear: Now, we\u2019ve actually done some work in this area and I would start with the comments that this has been impacted by both innovation and inflation. And I\u2019ll let Carol walk through the details of this, but we\u2019re actually please with what we\u2019re seeing.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We are. So we took our ticket and broke it into quintiles. And if you look at the bottom quintile, we see the price has jumped through innovation and inflation, 11% over the past couple of years. So it\u2019s moving out of that less than $50 bucket into a higher bucket. The other contributor is the price inflation and LED light bulb. LED light bulb would be in that \u2013 in the other bucket. So, it just the change in the business and we\u2019re reacting to that change.\nMatt Fassler: Great. Thank you so much guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.\nChuck Grom: Hi. Thanks. Just a quick modeling question, just on the expense growth factor certainly north of 100%, should we expect that to be pretty even throughout the year by quarter or are you expecting any lumpiness throughout the year?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It will be lumpy. It will be higher in the first half of the year than in the back half of the year, because in the back half of the year 2017 we had hurricane-related expenses that will not repeat.\nMatt Fassler: Okay. Helpful. And then just historically when you have that type of winter that you guys are going through this year and us as well. Can you just remind us how the business tends to pick back up in the spring based on your historical experience?\nCraig Menear: Well, totally, it\u2019s dependent on when spring actually breaks and that is -- that can happen earlier, it can happen late. Mother of Nature will control that. But what we do see from that type of activity is generally you'll see when you have a harsh winter you got a lot of garden opportunity with the replacement of shrubs. You have ice damage that takes place in Brooklyn. So there is different types of elements within the business that will actually see a benefit from a hard winter.\nMatt Fassler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Hi. Good morning. Just generally when costs are rising, transportation, labor, general inflation et cetera, how much of these costs increases are you able to pass-through with the consumer?\nCraig Menear: Well, first of all, in each situation with cost in our first cost of goods we look at that on a case-by-case basis and work with our suppliers to help them try to minimize as many impacts as we possibly can. And then candidly we look at our portfolio approach to how we actually deal with that. And so cost may not necessarily go into a category where we may absorb some costs. It could go somewhere else. And we obviously look to offset that within our own business to try to hold value for the customer.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Hi. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nDennis McGill: Hi. Good morning. Thank you everybody. Carol, first question from the Investor Day, I think you talked about the investments hopefully adding somewhere in the neighborhood of I think about 50 to 200 basis points to same-store sales growth. How did you think about benefit in 2018 when you formed the plan?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. Not lot of benefits in 2018. So we\u2019ve had to first make the investments and if you think about, we talked about $1 billion investment over the next three years. We\u2019re going to kind of ramp up. So you\u2019re going to see more of the return in the back half of the three-year planning than you do in the initial part of the three-year plan.\nDennis McGill: Okay. Thank you. And then second question when you talk about cash flow from the business and then look at the guidance for share repurchases, can you just maybe talk about how you thought about getting to that $4 billion number especially with repatriation being an opportunity and maybe also just update us on where that stands as far as getting that cash back?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. So based on the cash flow guidance that we\u2019ve given to and use of cash, you\u2019re like wow, you can have some left over cash. And that\u2019s right, we are. And we are exploring what to do with that cash. And it could be additional share repurchases, dividends, payback debt, built cash for the future so on and so forth. We\u2019re going to take our time just make through [Indiscernible] and determine what we will do with the cash. We will let you know. The $4 billion specifically is what we had on our Investor Day, so we just kept that for the year and then we\u2019ll update you as year continues.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, everyone. Carol, I don\u2019t know if this was answered earlier, if you did I apologize and I missed it. What is the mortgage rate that you think starts to adversely impact home pricing trends? And then relating to that obviously real estates are very localize industry, but you have thoughts regarding the potential impact on home prices in affected areas?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Let\u2019s look at the latter part into question first. 80% of American households were going to have more money this year because of tax reform, given the increases in the standard production. Further corporations are enjoying \u2013 many corporations are enjoying lower tax than we see many corporations taking that cash if you will and investing in the people [Indiscernible]. We think those offset any negative that could arrived with the change in the mortgage interest deduction or the cap on state and local tax reduction. And just a few other things; on the cap on mortgage interest reduction 750,000, only 5% of houses that are sold in a year are 750,000, so it\u2019s a small subset of what happens to the housing worker. Further as we\u2019ve talked about, only about 30% of tax filers itemize, and only about 22% itemize for mortgage reduction. On the state and local tax front, if you live in California or New York, you're not going to feel very good, but then there\u2019s a housing shortage. I commented on San Francisco with 0.8 months of supply. New York City has 2.2 months of supply. So we don\u2019t actually think those going to be any impact on housing as a result, although if you live in New York or California you may feel it. Now, on mortgage rates, you can\u2019t just look at mortgage rate alone, because you have to look at where home prices are going, to look at affordability. But if you just kept home prices where they are today, it\u2019s our view that mortgage rate to go to 7% before there\u2019s any issue on the affordability. The other way of looking at is just averages, right. And the average mortgage rate over the past 30 years is 5.6%. So that might be a good number for us to all to kind of land on.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nAlan Rifkin: Thank you. Congratulations Diane on your retirement and welcome back Isabel. So shortly before the tax reform was passed you laid out your three-year goals and presumably there are going to be incremental investment from the tax savings. Why is that -- and obviously those that will result in an increase returns. My question is why is there no change to the three-year 2020 guidance, if the returns by that point should be realized?\nCraig Menear: So, Alan, we\u2019re actually not looking to do incremental investment beyond what we shared, 11.1 billion over three years is what we believe that we need to do and there's a kind of you will a durability factor to making that all happened. So there is not really the opportunity to add a whole bunch of new investment on top. As Carol mentioned we are pulling some investments forward if we can do and make it happen faster, but don't look for us to add a whole new layer of investment on top of the 11 1 billion.\nAlan Rifkin: Okay. Thank you, Craig. And a follow-up if I may. I believe you said that the flooring category or comping positive was below the corporate average? It seems like for the first time in many quarters that is the case, I was curious if you provide some color what is going on in a category in your opinion?\nCraig Menear: We\u2019re very pleased with the performance. You have to remember, Alan, the average set is 7.5%, so it's very healthy across the flooring portfolio.\nAlan Rifkin: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks and Good morning. So following up on the SG&A, the sales growth rate, you guided over the three years 75% to 90%. Is the pull forward mainly from 2019 into 2018 and how should we think about the cadence of that 75 to 90 as we look past this year is in 2019 thus lower as a result?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We pull forward both from 2019 and 2020, so we\u2019ll update on 2019 and 2020 when we get to those years, but nothing changes from the overall expense growth factor guidance that we gave you back in December.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And as you\u2019re thinking about how robust the backdrop here is in home improvement? Has there\u2019s been any changes in terms of the promotional environment as it seems like some prices being passed through here as it becoming less promotional or any change at all sequentially?\nCraig Menear: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a significant change in the promotional activity, if anything we were less promotional in Q4, but the overall market was very similar to prior year.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks very much. Have a great spring.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.\nEric Bosshard : Good morning. In terms of Pro and online just curious what you learned or any big learnings from those three areas in 2017? And then how you think about the growth rate in 2018 relative to 2017 in those areas?\nCraig Menear: So, overall, we're very pleased with our Pro business in 2017 and we continue to see growth there. And as customers continue to take on bigger projects as a result of feeling good about their home values, we see that continuing as we move into 2018. Go on, if you have other comments on that.\nEdward Decker: Eric, I\u2019d say the other learning is that the more dimensional our relationship with our pro is the stronger our share of wallet becomes, and I think that was exemplified by the pros that are managed by our passes [Ph] which was one of our fastest-growing areas for a pro-business. So it\u2019s that pro-engagement and that one-on-one recognition that seems to be resonating with the customer and we will carry that into next year.\nEric Bosshard : And as it relates to the online, again, very pleased with what the team was able to accomplish in our online business, setting in a whole new platform that we operate on, enhancing our capabilities around search and mobile, and Kevin\u2019s here and I\u2019ll let him speak to how we are thinking about 2018.\nKevin Hofmann: Yes, certainly from a learning perspective, just reinforced what we\u2019ve been chasing, chasing the customer and wherever they lead us, we invested significantly to eliminate a lot of friction between the different channels as we pursue our One Home Depot strategy investing in expertise and knowledge in the online property. You\u2019ll see more of that in 2018, you know with similar growth aspirations, we got a consistent track record of over $1 billion  dollars of growth in each of the last few years in our online property and we\u2019ll look to do that again in 2018.\nEric Bosshard : And then one follow-up question, as inventory progress, inventory leverage was solid in 2017. The two points within that, what contributed to that and how should we think about the path of that moving forward?\nCraig Menear: Well we were very pleased with our overall inventory position as we came through the fourth quarter and finished the fiscal year. Our primary focus when it comes to inventory is to maintain in stock. That is first and foremost so that we have the customer needs on the shelf when they come. In market or [Indiscernible]...\nMark Holifield: Right, Craig. I mean customer service begins with instock, so that\u2019s always the top initiative, but we\u2019d expect to continue to leverage inventory as our business continues to grow in the quarter. We\u2019ll be making some investments as we open new distribution facilities for online, but we continue to expect to leverage our inventory.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, so if you just want to model in, model inventory turn around to 5.3 times.\nEric Bosshard : Great. Thank you.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Abby, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay, our last question will come from Daniel Binder with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Binder: Great. Thank you. Just on the pros, I was wondering if you\u2019d talk a little bit about that gap between DIY and Pro, I know it\u2019s been consistently growing faster than DIY. Is that accelerating and then could you also talk a little bit about the interline trends?\nCraig Menear: Well Daniel, I think the one thing that we\u2019ve seen is there\u2019s a little cloudiness in where the actual purchases are coming from, in some cases, you are seeing people at DIY projects that are now electing their pros to go and do the purchase and the work, so but we are very pleased with the DIY growth, and seeing strength with our consumer business as well as the pros, so there\u2019s a good balance there. And then as far as interline, we are pleased with the progress, pleased with the results. We saw a strong sales growth in all three end markets, institutional multifamily and trades, continue to see prior traction and pro purchase in the MRO initiative, so pleased with the progress.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And maybe one difference that we were seeing is the rate of growth for the high spend pro is the same as the rate of growth of the low spend pro, that\u2019s just so we are in terms of the recovery they are....\nDaniel Binder: And then one follow up if I could on merchandizing, you know one of the emerging trends we\u2019ve seen out there, obviously is the connected home, just wondering when we\u2019ll see more from Home Depot on that, it seems like you are pretty well positioned to capitalize on it, but maybe a little bit further behind some other players in the electronic space on that area of the business?\nEdward Decker: Yes we are rolling out some more dedicated end caps in one and two and even three days sets as the amount of connected home product comes into the store. We are super excited, there is new product coming from Ring, there\u2019s new product coming from Nest, there\u2019s new product on light and fan controls by Lutron, so really across the board, all our major suppliers are coming up with great innovative product and we are growing the space in the store to merchandise it appropriately.\nCraig Menear: I think the other thing that you\u2019ll see is just in general, in every bay in the store where there\u2019s an opportunity to have product that is enabled through technology, you\u2019ll see that happen over the next five years. It will continue to evolve and it won\u2019t be somewhat a section over the next five years, it will be in every day in the store. That will happen, because the manufacturers are finding ways to enhance their product for the customer.\nDaniel Binder: Great thanks.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you on our first quarter call in May.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s call and we thank you for your participation.

Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you, Diane, and good morning everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $25 billion, up 8.1% from last year. Comp sales were 7.9% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.7%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.84 in the third quarter, up 15% versus last year. I'm incredibly proud of our performance given that this quarter was one marked by an unprecedented number of natural disasters, from hurricanes and flooding to earthquakes and wildfires. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all of our associates and communities who are directly impacted. As they always do, our associates and suppliers did an incredible job supporting those in the paths of these natural disasters. They worked tirelessly and under difficult circumstances to get product where it needed to be, often as they too faced disruption in their own lives. Though our store teams worked tirelessly to reopen stores as quick as possible in the wake of these events, several of our stores, particularly in the areas like Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and St. Croix, were forced to remain closed for an extended period of time. Our solid performance in the quarter was driven by outstanding execution across the entire organization, though our results were not solely due to storm-related activities. We saw a broad-based growth across our geographies. Every region posted positive comps in the quarter, but the storms did impact the variability in performance across the regions. Internationally, both Mexico and Canada posted another quarter of positive comps in local currency. As Ted will detail, both tickets and transactions grew in the quarter, as we saw growth not only in storm-related product categories, but in core categories as well. We saw a healthy balance of growth from both our pro and DIY categories, with pro sales once again outpacing DIY sales in the quarter. We believe that the work we're doing to enhance the service capabilities for the unique needs of the pro customer continues to resonate. Our interconnected strategy continues to drive sales both in stores and online, as online sales grew approximately 19% in the quarter, now representing approximately 6.2% of our total sales, with approximately 45% of our online U.S. orders being picked up in our stores. And should a customer need to return an item purchased online for another item, our conveniently located stores are there for them, with 85% of our online order returns being completed in-store. For fulfillment options beyond the store, we continue to see great results with our store delivery which grows every week. We are also currently piloting other delivery options, which we'll talk to you about in more detail at our Investor Conference in December. The flexibility of our supply chain is a competitive advantage for our business, a fact that was particularly evident given the unpredictability of demand associated with this quarter's natural disasters. And while our supply chain did a fantastic job keeping impacted stores in stock, they did so while continuing to support the business in non-disaster-impacted areas as well. So, while this was a unique quarter for us, I am encouraged by the underlying health of the core business. From a macro perspective, we continue to see positive signs in the housing data, which we believe serves as a tailwind for our business. As Carol will detail, because of our outperformance in the third quarter and the expectation of additional sales from the rebuilding efforts associated with the storms, we are increasing our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. I want to close by thanking all of our associates, especially our store associates, for their hard work and continued dedication to our customers and communities. Helping in a time of need is a core part of The Home Depot culture and that is exactly what our associates did this quarter. We are very proud of their efforts. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thanks, Craig, and good morning everyone. We had a great third quarter, driven by strength in our core business. We also saw incremental demand stemming from the natural disasters during the quarter. I'd like to thank our cross-functional teams and supplier partners for their efforts in mobilizing our response. These efforts allowed us to get product to our communities at their time of need. We had five departments record double-digit comps in the quarter. This included lumber, appliances, electrical, indoor garden and tools. Building materials and flooring were also above the company's average comp. Decor, hardware, paint, millwork, plumbing, kitchen, bath and outdoor garden were positive, but below the company average. Driven by price deflation, lighting was slightly negative. In the third quarter, we saw growth in both ticket and transactions. Comp average ticket increased 5.1% and comp transactions increased 2.7%. Commodity price inflation in lumber, building materials and copper positively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 105 basis points. Foreign exchange rates also positively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 41 basis points. Big ticket sales in the third quarter or transactions over $900, which represent approximately 22% of our U.S. sales, were up 12.1%. The increase in big ticket sales was driven in part by strength in appliances, vinyl plank flooring, special order carpet, and several pro-heavy categories. Transactions for tickets under $50, which make up approximately 16% of our U.S. sales, grew by 1.8% in the quarter. In the third quarter, we saw strong sales with both our do-it-yourself and professional customers. Sales to our professional customers grew double digits in the quarter, with similar growth rates in both our high-spend and low-spend pros. Pro-heavy categories such as lumber, wire, insulation, gypsum and hand tools, all had double-digit growth during the quarter. Storm-related categories also saw significant growth, with double-digit comps in generators, wet/dry vacs, tarps and ladders. In response to the storms, our merchandising execution, field merchandising and supply chain teams worked together to make real-time decisions to adjust our product assortment and inventory levels. This allowed us to better stage product and optimize our store footprint. Looking beyond the storm-related demand, we continue to see momentum in our core business. Comps in non-impacted markets remained strong, with healthy growth in both ticket and transactions. During the quarter, we hosted several events that helped drive traffic and create excitement in our stores. We were pleased with our annual Halloween, harvest and Labor Day events, which recorded strong growth year-over-year. Now, let me turn our attention to the fourth quarter. In our constant pursuit of being the product authority in home improvement, we continue to focus on bringing new and innovative products to market that save our customers both time and money. One area where we continue to demonstrate this product authority is with lithium-ion cordless power tools, and now we are on the forefront of bringing this technology to adjacent categories. In the fourth quarter, we are excited to introduce the most powerful cordless compressor in the marketplace. The DEWALT FLEXVOLT cordless air compressor offers all the convenience and portability of cordless, and allows our customers to continue using the pneumatic tools they already own. Each battery charge provides our customers the power and run-time they need to complete a variety of projects. This new DEWALT FLEXVOLT cordless air compressor is a big box exclusive to The Home Depot. Adding to our incredible lineup of professional-grade power tools, we are excited to introduce a new product lineup from Makita that offers an even more powerful cordless solution for a multitude of tools. The new Makita LXT product line offers 36-volt power to a fresh lineup of recip, circular and miter saws, as well as grinders. With these tools, our pros will be able to tackle any job faster and with up to 50% more run-time. This new and advanced lineup of power tools is also a big box exclusive to The Home Depot. With fall coming to an end and the winter season rapidly approaching, our associates are preparing for another series of exciting events. In the fourth quarter, we will host our Black Friday and holiday events along with our best gift center ever. Our gift center will consist of incredible values and products from the best brands such as Milwaukee, DEWALT, Ryobi, Makita, Diablo and Husky just to name a few. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our third quarter results in detail, I would like to take a minute to touch on the impact of the three hurricanes that affected our business in the quarter. First, we saw increased demand as customers prepared for and started to recover from these events. We also experienced store and DC closings. In fact, we had 236 stores closed for some period during the quarter. We estimate that hurricane-related sales positively impacted total company comp sales growth by approximately $282 million in the quarter. These sales were in lower-margin categories like plywood and generators, and we had additional supply chain costs. So, our gross margin on the hurricane-related sales was considerably less than our company average. Finally, we experienced roughly $104 million of hurricane-related expense in the quarter for items like people cost, increased security in our affected stores, and storm damage. So, while our year-over-year sales growth was positively impacted by the hurricanes, our operating profit was negatively impacted by $51 million. In the third quarter, total sales were $25 billion, an increase of 8.1% versus last year. A weaker U.S. dollar positively impacted total sales growth by approximately $102 million or 0.4%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 7.9% for the quarter with positive comps of 7.7% in August, 9% in September, and 7.2% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.7% for the quarter with positive comps of 7.3% in August, 8.8% in September, and 7% in October. In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.6%, a decline of 17 basis points from last year. While there were many factors that drove our gross margin performance in the quarter, we can isolate the year-over-year change to the impact of the hurricane-related sale. In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 54 basis points to 19.9%. As I previously mentioned, during the quarter we had approximately $104 million of hurricane-related expenses. Backing out the sales and expenses associated with the hurricane, our operating expense as a percent of sales was better than our plan. Our operating margin for the third quarter was 14.7%, an increase of 36 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter grew by $11 million to $247 million, reflecting a higher long-term debt balance versus last year, offset somewhat by higher interest income. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.9% compared to 36.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.84, an increase of 15% from last year. Now moving on to some additional highlights. During the quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico for an ending store count of 2,283. Total sales per square foot for the third quarter were $412, up 7.9% from last year. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $13.4 billion, up $178 million from last year, and inventory turns were 5.2 times, up two-tenths from last year. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $2.1 billion or 12.3 million shares of our outstanding stock. This included 5.6 million shares on the open market and 6.7 million shares repurchased through an accelerated share repurchase or ASR program. For the shares repurchased under the ASR program, this is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon completion of the ASR in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2017, we're now targeting share repurchases of $8 billion, of which $2.1 billion will occur in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we took advantage of an attractive interest rate environment and raised $1 billion of long-term debt, of which $500 million was used to repay debt that came due in September. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 32.5%, 340 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we continue to see underlying strength and momentum in our core business. The macro environment remains supportive, and we believe housing is a tailwind for our business. In addition, we expect the hurricane recovery efforts to continue across a number of our markets. As a result, today we are lifting our fiscal 2017 sales and earnings per share growth guidance. We now expect fiscal 2017 sales to increase by approximately 6.3%, with positive comps of 6.5%. We now expect our fiscal 2017 gross margin to decline by approximately 12 basis points. For the year and reflecting the expense impact of the hurricanes, we now expect our expenses to grow at approximately 55% of our sales growth rate. And finally, for the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.3%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. For fiscal 2017, we now expect diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 14% to $7.36. We look forward to talking with you at our Investor Conference on December 6 in Boston where we will give you an update on our key strategic initiatives and our long-term financial targets. We thank you for your participation in today's call and, Catherine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll first go to Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Morning.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: So, how long do you expect the hurricane-related spending to impact your sales results? And how is the trajectory going to look? Is it initially the greatest right around the event and then it tails off over time, or will it be pretty consistent over the course of the period that you expect to have an impact?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Hey, Michael. We certainly expect, as Carol called out, to see continued sales increase from the hurricane as we move into 2018. It'll be pretty much in the first half we think.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah. So, we have a lot of experience with hurricanes and we see that Hurricane Harvey was much like the Baton Rouge flooding last year. Hurricane Irma is much like Superstorm Sandy, although on a smaller scale, and Hurricane Maria, well, it's much like Katrina, although on a smaller scale. And what our past experience tells us is that the hurricane-related sales tend to be the highest in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which the hurricanes occurred and then they tail off over time. As Craig said, we would expect them to tail off throughout 2018. For the purposes of building our forecast and guidance today, we have hedged back some of the anticipated hurricane-related sales in the fourth quarter, because it's the fourth quarter and anything can happen with weather. I will tell you based on the first two weeks of our sales in November, our forecast would appear to be conservative, but it's a good thing to put together a conservative forecast. When we look at the year-on-year impact, we would expect, as Craig mentioned, that there would be no comp DWIT (20:43) next year as a result of the hurricanes. We would have the same amount of hurricane sales in 2018 as we had in 2017.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Carol, do you want to explicitly tell us what the amount of hurricane-related spending that you expect in the fourth quarter?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: I would not like to specifically tell you that.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. I thought I would try. And then, I forget it was Craig or Ted, one of you gave us a little tease about the analyst meeting and talking about new delivery options that you're piloting. If you were to go free shipping on some dollar threshold across all of your online SKUs, how margin dilutive would that be to your overall P&L? It looks like you've got, out of your top 150,000 items right now, you've got about 6,800 that would qualify for free shipping. So, what if you went kind of across the board, how margin dilutive would that be?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Michael, today we offer free shipping on any order over $45, so the majority of everything we ship today falls under free shipping.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors: Thanks. Good morning. I'm just wondering if you guys could speak to the quarterly progression of sales, excluding the hurricane impact throughout the \u2013 not only in the U.S., but worldwide?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, we didn't go back and recalculate the cost, but just let me tell you the impact of the hurricane-related sales and then you can do the math. We project \u2013 not project, but we have seen that the hurricane-related sales in August were about $10 million, the hurricane-related sales in September were about $150 million, and the hurricane-related sales in October were about $120 million.\nChuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors: Okay. Yeah, we could do the math there. Great. And then, when you look ahead and try to quantify the impact of the top line, I'm just wondering when you think about the gross margin profile of these sales going forward, how historically has it played out? Obviously, here in the third quarter they were significantly lower than you would typically see it, but how do they progress going forward?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: When you think about the kind of prep sales, if you will, that largely happens as you move into a storm, you're selling things like plywood and generators which are very low-margin rate goods. As you move past that and get into cleanup and recovery, you then begin to see a more normalized mix of sale across the business, and it depends again on the type of storm that it is. And that has a tendency to be more normalized margin in the business.\nChuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors: Okay. Thanks very much, and good luck.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now hear from Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Good morning.\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: You talked a little bit about product innovation, specifically the battery technology. Connected home has also been an emerging category. It seems like a natural fit for a few different retailers out there, one has been particularly aggressive. I'm just curious if you could give us some thoughts on how Home Depot is positioned to benefit from that.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, Dan. It's Ted. I think we're very well positioned. We have quite a bit of product that's selling very nicely with strong growth year-over-year. I'm most excited right now about some of the new thermostat product coming out from Nest. We have great innovation coming from Ring. We've been partnering with Ring for some time. They've given us a number of launch exclusives as well as nuanced product exclusives. I think that speaks to their confidence in Home Depot's ability to bring that type of product to market and sell it. But we're experimenting with how we display the product. As you know, we're a working warehouse, so how to get that product aggregated in a series of bays with different merchandising approaches is something we're working on, and happy with the number of different formats we're utilizing right now.\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: Great. And then as \u2013 for my follow-up question, a separate topic on credit. I know you don't own your credit portfolio, but just wondering if you can provide us with some color on how that portfolio is doing, if there's an increase in lending, willingness to lend, delinquencies, write-offs, things of that nature.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, thanks very much. So, you're right, we don't own our credit portfolio, but we do have visibility into the portfolio. It's a very healthy portfolio with an average net receivable of $12.6 billion. As we look inside the portfolio, we see that it's performing nicely. Our loss rates are up slightly year-on-year, but they're considerably under the historical average. The historical average, just to put in perspective, is 4.3%. In terms of approvals for customers applying for our private label credit card, we see on the consumer side that 73% of all applications are being approved with a FICO of around 750. So, we write a pretty high quality here. On the pro side, 72% of all applications are being approved, and for the pro, that line is around $6,700. So, hopefully that's helpful.\nDaniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC: Yes. Thank you very much.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yes.\nOperator: And we'll continue on to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Nice quarter. Can you diagnose the health of the do-it-yourself versus the do-it-for-me customer, if you're seeing any changes in frequency or ticket? And I ask because there's a lot of focus on the ticket and traffic breakdown as if there's something to be gleaned about the cycle based on how the customer segments are behaving.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: We actually see growth across both the pro categories, the do-it-for-me categories and the DIY categories. And we've seen a sequential improvement in the small ticket quarter-over-quarter, tickets below $50, which have a tendency to lean more towards DIY as well. And the large ticket growth continues as a result of strong pro business and categories like appliances and roofing and flooring. So, not really seeing anything that has us concerned at all about the DIY business.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Or do-it-for-me.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Right.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: No.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Not any one.\nSimeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And my follow-up, just two parts. First, if we get a cold winter this year, does that represent a tough compare in any way since we've had a couple warm winters? And does it change any complexion of margin for the next couple quarters? And then the follow-up or the second part was just, can you comment on the online sales? It looks like the trajectory slowed, I'm curious why.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: In terms of the weather, if you will, what happens is some categories will do better in cold weather, other categories will not. So, we've had the benefit of project business through warm winters, but then that actually puts pressure on your categories in the cold weather type things, like heaters and so on. So, it's really a balancing act, one offsets the other.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: And that's why we tend to look at our business on the half and not the quarters, because there always are these weather-related year-over-year compares and we have this bathtub effect that we've talked to you about in the first half that always occurs. On the margin, the margin is what the margin is based on where the sales are, but no real pressure coming at us.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Right. We were actually pleased with our growth online. Kevin is here. I'd let him comment.\nKevin Hofmann - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, we saw real strength in our flooring business, our blinds and window coverings businesses, our bath business. And as Carol mentioned, we had a number of stores that had days they were closed due to the hurricane impacts and that actually affected some of our online penetration in those stores, but that was really the only thing that caused a blip in the quarter for us.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah. The sales growth was $243 million year-on-year, so we were pleased with that. And just to put the store closings into perspective, they were closed a cumulative 809 days, which is the same as having 2.2 stores closed for an entire year.\nSimeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Well, thank you.\nOperator: Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan has our next question.\nChristopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Morning.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Morning.\nChristopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So, I wanted to follow up on the expenses. So, it looks like ex the hurricane top line and bottom line SG&A impact, you grew SG&A to sales at about a 39% growth rate. How do you think about that ratio as you look forward in the business? I know you typically sort of guide to 50% and there's always a kind of productivity opportunity at The Home Depot. Do you think that 50% is still the right number? Or is 40% the right number? Do you see any upward pressure on your sort of marginal flow-through around SG&A versus sales?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, let's just look at the fourth quarter and, as you know, we don't guide on the fourth quarter, but I'll give you some color on the fourth quarter. The expense growth factor in the fourth quarter will be similar to what we've guided for the entire year. And as you know, we've now lifted our guidance such that the expense growth factor should be 55% for the entire year and you may say why is that? Well, a few reasons. One, we will have some ongoing hurricane-related expense not to the extent that we experienced in the third quarter, but there is some natural disaster expense that's going to happen in the fourth quarter. Two, we are significantly outperforming our plan, which is a good news story and that means we're going to be paying more bonuses, so we'll have more success sharing for our hourly associates. And we're delighted with that, but that will put some pressure on the expense growth factor in the fourth quarter. And then there's just a little bit of currency nuance in all of this because when you have a weaker U.S. dollar, your expenses outside the United States when you translate them back actually are a little bit higher than it would have been last year. So, hopefully that helps guide what the fourth quarter would look like. And then as you know, we've got our Investor Day coming up on December 6 and we're going to give new financial targets for 2020, so we'll grind you through everything on such things.\nChristopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I guess \u2013 but as you think about, it seems like if I look back in 2016 you grew, I think, 30% relative to sales. So, does that indicate any sort of upward pressure on incremental cost versus sales?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah. You recall at the beginning of the year we said 50% was a good number to use and that included rising people costs. I mean, we're not alone. All retailers are faced with rising people costs and we view our people as an investment, so we have some of that pressure. But, Chris, at the end of the day, the operating margin this company wants to lift in a BAU basis. We will leverage expense in a BAU basis and if you want to use 50% as a BAU number, that's a good number to use.\nChristopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Understood. And then just curious about your crystal ball, you talked about no DWIT (32:23) from the hurricanes as you look to next year. It seems like there's a bigger hurricane this year versus last year, so what gives you the confidence in saying that at this point? I guess why not let the Street put the DWIT (32:39) in there? What are you seeing that would motivate you to guide that way this far out?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: I mean as we've shared, each storm is different and Harvey was very different than the other two storms. And the situation in Harvey is a much more protracted recovery because of the nature of the storm being water-based and the fact that there were a fair amount of folks that didn't have insurance because they didn't live in a 100-year floodplain. Unfortunately, they were in a 500-year floodplain. And so we just think that that recovery is going to be protracted. And in a storm like that, you have to go in and basically people are ripping everything up down to the studs and starting over. That's going to take a while to recover.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: We have \u2013 I've got a 10-page deck that \u2013 well, if you work for us, I'd tell you. And I'm not going to tell you. But if we look at Harvey as an example, it really looks so much like the Baton Rouge flooding, but it's 3.7 times bigger than the Baton Rouge. So, we just modeled our experience in Baton Rouge, kind of multiplied it by three point times to get the effect for this year and into next. There's actually a lot of science that went behind this expectation, but I appreciate the suggestion that maybe we should put a DWIT in (34:09) but I'm not hoping to, but I appreciate the suggestion.\nChristopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So, it's a first half versus back half 2018, basically?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah. We'll be good in the first half. There'll be \u2013 yeah.\nChristopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Understood.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah.\nChristopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll continue on to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning, and nice quarter. I wanted to follow up on the pro business, nice to see that comps continue to grow in the double-digit range. I realize it's tough to isolate, but as you think about some of the initiatives in place, whether it's credit or delivery or integrating the Interline catalog, can you maybe point to where you're seeing utilization of some of those offerings is starting to increase and what you think is really driving some of that traction? Thank you.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Bill?\nWilliam G. Lennie - The Home Depot, Inc.: Seth, this is Bill Lennie. It really \u2013 I'd say that the pro business is on a broad base of strength, whether it's the project business that continues to be strong, as well as a good balance between ticket and transaction. But we have made some enhancements to our Pro MyView (35:19) system in the store which gives our PASAs or Pro Account Sales Associates a better view into their customers and better insights on where to reach for category expansion and how to get a better engagement with our customers. I think the acquisition of Compact Power is another area where we can increase the engagement with our pros. And we know that the more that we get that multilevel engagement, whether it's online, whether it's delivery, whether it's any one of our other services, that we do increase the reach into the customers' wallet and we do start to see growth in the share of the customers' business. Then on top of that, we're also seeing an increase in the number of pros that are shopping our stores as well. And we've got solid performance against categories, against FCC codes and increasing pro customer engagement.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you for that. And then just as a follow-up, as you think about the housing outlook, one of the things we've observed is a pickup in home ownership among millennial consumers. If we assume that continues and that's going to become an increasingly important demographic for the business over time, can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing, if there's anything different in terms of behavior for that customer group and some of the things you're doing to try to target that customer base? Thank you.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Sure. We're actually not seeing a ton of difference. Obviously, if you think about new home ownership, some of the things that happened early on in that is categories like paint, categories like outdoor garden where they're beautifying their home. Those are the simpler projects that begin and that kind of takes place no matter what age group is buying the home. But we're very pleased with the trend. This is something that we saw in our research, that millennials would, in fact, step into home ownership. It was just a delayed cycle and that is playing out. And we think that bodes well for the housing market going forward. Also, our research says that, as Craig said, the types of projects that they're going to engage in are very similar to any new homeowner and in research, we see that the millennial is showing an interest to be DIYers as well, so actually a quite keen interest to do the projects themselves.\nSeth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. With regard to the hurricane sales we've talked a lot about, and I know this might be a little near term in focus, but is there any way to measure \u2013 clearly Home Depot stepped up nicely here in its efforts to help customers, but how your market share tracked in these events versus what you would normally consider market share trends from the business?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, we really have no way of knowing that. It's just \u2013 it's happening, it's unfolding right now, we just don't have any way of knowing that.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's fair. The second question I had with regard to online, again we called it out as a growing, but still a small portion of the business. As online continues to evolve, is there any surprises here with regard to maybe what your customers are buying online? And then also, how should we think about just the investment needed to continue to support the online initiatives? Thanks.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: As it relates to any surprise in the online, I think, probably the thing I'd say there is we shared several years back our bubble chart, if you will, in terms of how we thought the online business would play out by categories, and there was a group of businesses in the lower left of that chart that we thought wouldn't have much influence. I think the thing that we've now realized is the shopping experience in almost every category starts in the digital world and it truly is an interconnected experience going forward. So, we're paying attention to the digital representation across all of our business as we go forward, creating an interconnected experience, if you will, the one Home Depot experience for each category and that's probably the big, I'd say, learning from a few years back that we've had.\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: To build on that in a bit, Craig, you mentioned our bubble chart listing all our key categories and looked at what is the intensity of inquiry, online and then matched against the actual purchase behavior. And the purchases haven't changed that much. The large categories that were large three years ago are large today. It's a lot of bath, a lot of lighting, a lot of power tools, et cetera. Those continue to be big businesses. But some of the most heavily engaged, again as Craig said, we're not going to get a lot of purchasing online with pro commodity, we see the highest engagement online is with our pros checking inventory levels and price. So, again a very interconnected shopping experience. They're still then going to the store, but they want to make sure everything is there for their project before they go to the store.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: And so that means we have to continue to invest in the experience and at our Investor Conference on December 6, we will lay out our investing plans.\nBrian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: So, I look forward to that. Thank you very much.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thanks.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Alan Rifkin with BTIG has our next question.\nAlan Rifkin - BTIG LLC: Thank you very much, and congratulations on a great quarter.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thanks.\nAlan Rifkin - BTIG LLC: First question for Craig. Craig, you mentioned that the flexibility of your supply chain continues to be an asset benefiting you. Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color on exactly what you are doing there in the sustainability of things?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Sure. And I also have Mark Holifield here, too. He can jump in, but I'd say the investments that we've made in creating the core components of our supply chain, our RDC or rapid deployment network, has been a significant advantage in our ability to flow and point goods where it needs to be. And it all starts there. And, Mark, I don't know if you want to add on to that, but?\nMark Holifield - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, our focus continues to be on creating a fastest and most efficient supply chain in home improvement and to do that, we're planning and collaborating much more with our vendors through our Sync initiative using our truckload resources much more capably filling our trucks and building our productivity within the four walls of our distribution centers and really synchronizing the whole flow of the supply chain to achieve that. And we've had great results in working with our suppliers to make that happen.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: I guess just one last comment that I'd have on that, Alan, is Ted called out our field merchandising team. They play a key role in these type of situations, where they truly become the field general on the battlefield, if you will, in a sense and help direct and point the supply chain and the merchants' efforts. And that's a key component of what we do as well.\nAlan Rifkin - BTIG LLC: Okay. Thank you. And just a follow-up if I may for Carol. Inventories at $13.4 billion, up about 1.3%, substantially lower than your revenue growth. What effect from the hurricane, if any, was there on your inventory levels? And can you maybe just provide, Carol, some commentary on if those levels are satisfactory to you right now? Thanks.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, the impact of the hurricane on the entire supply chain was enormous and the team did an awesome job of redirecting products to get it to our stores and our customers in need. In terms of our inventory levels, our inventory turnover, we're very pleased where we are. We've worked really hard to drive productivity and inventory and that starts with the products that we source, the great associates who sell them and then how to flow them through our supply chain. One of the initiatives that we've been investing in is something we call supply chain, we think, which lowers the variability and improves the predictability of orders. One of the desired outcomes was higher inventory productivity and we're seeing that. So, we're very happy. Long-winded answer to say we're happy with our inventory levels.\nAlan Rifkin - BTIG LLC: Great. Thank you very much.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And Matthew McClintock with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. Carol, you said that you will leverage expenses. In the past, you've said that there's always a natural tendency for your gross margin to want to lift, but you reinvest back in value. And I guess my question is, how do you think about your future growth algorithm coming from further reinvestments in value versus, maybe, investments in the store experience or investments in deliveries? How should we kind of segment the growth going forward from those two buckets? Thank you.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you for asking the question. We're devoting a good part of our Investor Day on December 6 to talk about the future and how we parse through that. There's a BAU point of view and then there will be an investing point of view and we'll share with you both to give you a real clear understanding of what we're going to be doing over the next several years.\nMatthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I'll look forward to that.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Sorry to kick the can down the road, but we've got an Investor Day in just a few weeks.\nMatthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Not trying to steal your thunder in any way.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.\nMatthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: But if I could ask a follow-up then, just on Dan's question regarding connected home. On appliances specifically, how do you think about evolving the selling model of appliances as they become more connected and how to think about tying that into your broader connected home offerings? Thank you.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, we're very engaged that the product manufacturers are really coming up with some terrific innovation. We're working with them closely. We have a view into the pipeline of what's coming. We integrate then with other products in the store. As we've said before, we're very much an open-source platform where any of our products can work with any other products through an agnostic hub. So, yeah, we think we're in a great spot. We added a lot to our online collateral to showcase all products, but in particular appliances. It's a category we've put a lot of effort into, lots of photos and 360-degree spin and features and measurements and how to get ready for installation, a home delivery model, and contacting the customer the day before and then hours before the actual installation. So, it's all part of our end-to-end thinking and business model development for appliances.\nMatthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot, and look forward to seeing everyone.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go to Kate McShane with Citi.\nKate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Morning.\nKate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: My question was on Interline. Now, that Interline is integrated and your salespeople are able to access that inventory for The Home Depot customer, how much do you think that is contributing to comp? And how much do you think there's room to ramp that business up in a more meaningful way at the store level?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: First of all, let me start with we're very excited about the Interline business and we continue to work the integration of that business, and we're pleased overall with the direction and results we're seeing in that. And, Bill, I'll let you...\nWilliam G. Lennie - The Home Depot, Inc.: So, Kate, we really have two initiatives rolled out into the stores. The first one is pro MRO, which gives the pro customers shopping in our stores access to the Interline catalog and we're seeing that engagement in those sales ramp week-over-week in a nice fashion right on target to where we would expect them to be. Key categories for engagement with the pros are running in plumbing, electrical, HVAC, and hardware. So, it's right down the center of that and the core of the business. And then the second initiative is our ProPurchase card which I would really describe as a pro access card. It gives the Interline customers access to shop our stores and with the swipe card have their purchases billed back onto their accounts, and we're seeing that adoption rate ramp back up. We were off to a light launch for that, but it's trending nicely and we're pleased with both initiatives and then when we're together in December, we'll talk about some next steps and next phases.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Given the size of our company, it's hard to see that all those success flowing through on the top line in a measurable way right now, but the trend is right. The trend is positive, and the opportunity set is big. As we've described, the addressable market in the MRO space is $50 billion, and we're just scratching the surface there, so there's a lot of room to grow.\nKate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll continue on to Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning and thank you. First question, I guess, Ted, on the storm recovery, what you saw in October, I guess, maybe tail end of October into November, are there categories that you could call out as seeing a disproportionate benefit from some of the repair items?\nEdward P. Decker - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, I think if you look at the categorization of the two storms, as Craig said, both are very similar in the preparation. You're doing plywood to board up windows, and you're getting generators and water, et cetera. And then when the storm hits, a lot of things like outdoor tools and chainsaws and debris removal. After that, the flood in the more Houston market, there you're literally ripping the floor to the studs. So, you have wiring and wiring devices and gypsum and mud and paint and flooring, quite a bit of flooring product, also cabinetry and appliances, et cetera. With the storm in Florida that went up the coast, that's more exterior damage, say, roofing and gutters, some windows, shutters, exterior paint, and things like that. So, we see the duration of the storm much more out of Houston as we get into the interior fit-and-finish of flooded-out homes.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Carol, on the holiday side, that's been an area in the fourth quarter the last several years where you've been able to generate some solid upside, and you talked about maybe being conservative on the hurricane side of things. How would you frame the holiday side within the forecast and any additional color you can provide on what might be different this year, exciting this year that would create another lift on top of last year's success?\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah. Well, we plan to comp last year's outstanding results, and we're going to do that, and maybe we have a conservative forecast. So, maybe even a bit better.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: We're pleased with the early results.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: We sure are. The first two weeks of November have started off very strong.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC: All right. Thanks. Good luck, guys.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I just wanted to \u2013 I mean after that last comment about how strong things are in November, I just want to know, outside of the hurricane areas, did you guys want to give us a U.S. comp?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: No, I don't think we'll do that, but I can tell you this. Our business, if you look at the business in areas not affected by hurricanes, I mean we're actually very pleased with the business, both from a transaction standpoint, a ticket growth standpoint, growth in key categories across the business. We see strength across the store and across geographies, as we said in our earlier comments. So, we're very pleased with the trends in the business right now.\nScott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC: And would you be comfortable calling it sequential strength?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah. I mean...\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: Sure.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah. And if you look at it as well on a two-year stack basis, sure.\nScott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Then the one thing (52:57) we had a lot of questions, but one thing that hasn't been talked about and we get a lot of questions on is tax policy. Obviously, with the rollout of the House plan, we saw a little step-back in some of the home-related hard-lining names, and I just wondered if you guys had a thought as we go into 2018 about tax policy. Where we are in the cycle? Generally, that's the kind of question we get, too. And if you have any fears as we move into 2018, that we could actually see a slowdown in your business, ex the hurricanes. Thanks.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Sure. So, on a broad basis, I'd say we're very supportive of tax reform that would fuel the economy and create jobs. And so, that's something that we hope we see take place here. And I think there's obviously a lot going on between the House and the Senate. We'll see where this all falls out. As it relates to some of the pieces that are being discussed individually and how that impacts housing, candidly, we don't subscribe to the fact that we believe the mortgage interest deduction elimination would have much of an impact. I mean we just don't think it has much, and in large part because the majority of households wouldn't have an impact from what's described today. But it's pretty early to tell. We don't know what's going to get passed.\nCarol B. Tom\u00e9 - The Home Depot, Inc.: It's early days. Our research shows that only 23% of tax filers actually use the deduction. And then of the people who have mortgages, only 5% have mortgages in excess of $500,000. And then if you have to think about, well, what is the impact to those who actually have mortgages in excess of $500,000 who might itemize and use deductions, it's really based on that marginal tax bracket. And the way to think about it (54:53) cost of their mortgage. And with mortgage rates so low, it's not a material impact. In fact, we know that for every 25 basis points increase in mortgage rate, it's $40 a month. So, you can do the math. You can come up with your own impact. But we just don't \u2013 as we stand here today, don't think there'll be a material impact. As we think about housing broadly and fears of slowdown, we don't see that for 2018, 2019 and 2020 for a number of reasons. We've talked about an aging housing stock, household formation and home price appreciation, and you may say, well, home prices are really hot, haven't they fully recovered peak to trough? Well, yes, they have, but on an inflation basis, they're still down double digit. And when you think about the wealth effect that's been created with higher home prices, there's been about a 122% increase in equity or about $64,000 per home, and that's translating into spending in the home. And the forecast for home price appreciation next year is very good. So, we don't \u2013 the rumors of our impending slowdown, we don't see because we look at the underlying data and then we look at what happens in our stores every day and on our website, and we just don't see it.\nDiane Dayhoff - The Home Depot, Inc.: Catherine...\nScott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks.\nDiane Dayhoff - The Home Depot, Inc.: ...we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you so much for fitting me in. Good morning. Two kind of clean-up questions on a couple of tactical items. First of all, obviously, it's a tough quarter to discern the significance of moves in individual line items, but if you could talk about how you think the storm impacted your traffic numbers versus your ticket numbers during the quarter.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: So, again, when \u2013 Matt, when we looked at the business across regions and looked at non-storm areas versus storm areas, the data around tickets and transactions is actually pretty comparable. And we didn't see a dramatic departure. Obviously, Houston, that market is up and up significantly. But when you look at regions which are, give or take, 100 stores, we don't see a big departure in the numbers, storm versus non-storm.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then secondly, we didn't talk much about the promotional environment. Obviously, the gross margin ex the impact of the storms looked very clean. Your appliance business was quite strong, and you didn't seem to pay a price for that. Anything noteworthy in the market, particularly relative to the first half of the year?\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah, we see a pretty similar promotional cadence. Most people's Black Friday ads are out and it's pretty much right on last year, so maintaining the current promotional environment.\nMatthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you so much, guys.\nCraig A. Menear - The Home Depot, Inc.: Yeah.\nDiane Dayhoff - The Home Depot, Inc.: Well, thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to meeting with you at our Investor Conference in Boston on December 6.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation.

Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter achieving a milestone of the highest quarterly sales and net earnings results in the company history. Sales for the second quarter were $28.1 billion, up 6.2% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.3% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 6.6%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.25 in the second quarter, up 14.2% versus last year. We continue to see broad based growth across the store in all geographies. In the U.S. all three of our divisions posted positive comps in the second quarter as did all of our 19 regions and top 40 markets. Internationally, both Mexico and Canada posted another quarter of positive comps in local currency. Our solid performance was driven by the outstanding execution of our store and merchant teams delivering value and service for our customers across multiple events both in store and online. As Ted will detail both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter and all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. We saw a healthy balance of growth from both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro sales once again outpacing DIY sales in the quarter. We believe that the work that we are doing to enhance the service capabilities for the unique needs of our Pro customers continues to resonate. We are focused on being a valued partner for our Pros by offering solutions both in-store and at the job site that help them to more effectively manage their business. This includes enhancing our leadership position in tool realm. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Compact Power Equipment, a leading national provider of equipment rental and maintenance services. Compact Power has provided larger jobsite equipment rentals at more than 1000 Home Depot stores since 2009. The acquisition is yet another investment to enhance our portfolio service offerings for our Pro and though we have worked closely with the Compact Power team for many years we are delighted to officially welcome them to the Home Depot family. Our investment in Interline and the MRO customer is another avenue to better serve the needs of our Pros. Use case one, the rollout of Interline\u2019s catalog of products to Home Depot stores is now implemented and we are pleased with the early results. We also continue to roll out use case 2, which enables Interline customers to shop Home Depot stores using a swipe card linked to their Interline account. Though it is early days, we are seeing an incremental sales lift from accounts who have been given the swipe card. Our deeper level of engagement with the Interline customers has helped to drive sales growth that outpaced the company average in the quarter and we remain very excited about the MRO opportunity going forward. Another growth engine for our business is our focus in interconnected retail. Our dotcom business represented 6.4% of sales and grew approximately 23% in the quarter. Our digital team continues to invest in contents, side improvement and better mobile experiences to take the friction out of the interconnected experience online, while our operations team remains focussed on improving the Interconnected experience in store. The result of these combined efforts is continued improvement in sales and customer satisfaction scores across both platforms. This is the power of interconnected retail. As you know we look at productivity as a virtuous cycle here at the Home Depot and our efforts to connect our business end to end continue to pay dividends that enable us to reinvest in the customer experience. We are pleased with the productivity in the business during the quarter as the end to end initiatives to improve freight handling in the store continue to drive labor efficiency and optimize product flow from truck to shelf. Beyond the four walls of our stores, we continued to drive productivity throughout our value chain with initiatives like supply chain sync. Sync is live in all of our RDCs but as you know this is a multiyear, multi phase endeavour as we work to unboard each of our suppliers flowing products through our RDCs. We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain as our investment over the past several years is having a positive impact on logistics cost, inventory productivity and service to our stores and customers. Turning to the macro environment, we continue to see positive signs in the housing data which we believe serve as a tailwind for our business. As Carol will detail, because of our out performance in the first half versus our plan we are increasing our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect fiscal 2017s sales growth of approximately 5.3% and diluted earnings per share of $7.29. The success of our spring selling season is the direct result of our 400,000 plus associates and their passion for our customers that extend well beyond serving them in our aisles. For example, this year we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Home Depot\u2019s in-store kids workshops. Held in our stores on the first Saturday of every month, these workshops have become a source of empowerment, accomplishment and pride for millions of children and their families. We like to think that we are fostering the next generation of do-it-yourselfers with some of the most enthusiastic participants over the years even trading in their many aprons for larger ones by becoming associates in our stores themselves. I want to close by thanking all of our associates for the hard work and continued dedication to our customers, as they once again successfully navigated the increased demands associated with our busiest selling season. Based on the first half results, approximately 99% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. We are very proud of their efforts. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig and good morning everyone. We had a great second quarter driven by strength of both our Pro and do-it-yourself customers. In addition, our online business continued its momentum as online sales grew approximately 23% versus last year. We saw broad-based growth across the store as all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. Lumber, Electrical, Tools and Flooring had double-digit comps in the quarter. Building Materials, Appliances, Indoor Garden and Decor were above the company average. Plumbing Millwork, Kitchen and Bath, Outdoor Garden, Hardware, Paint and Lighting were positive but below the company average. In the second quarter, total comp transactions grew by 2.6% and comp average ticket increased 3.6%. Commodity price inflation in Lumber, Building Materials and Copper positively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 68 basis points. During the quarter, we held a Memorial Day, Father\u2019s Day and Red, White and Blue events. These events drove excitement in our stores for both customers and associates and we were very pleased with the results. Looking at big ticket sales in the second quarter, transactions over $900, which represent approximately 22% of our U.S. sales, were up 12.4%. A few drivers behind the increasing big ticket purchases were appliances, flooring and certain Pro heavy categories. Transactions for tickets under $50 which now make up approximately 16% of our U.S. sales grew by 1.5% in the quarter, reflecting, among other things the return of our Outdoor Garden business in certain parts of the country. In the second quarter Pro sales outpaced the company average driven by both our high spend and low spend pros. We saw strong comps across several lumber and building material categories, as well as categories like pipe and fittings, power tools and wire. Sales to our DIY customers also should strengthen the quarter, with flooring, storage and organization and patio all outperforming the company average comp. We strive to balance the art and science of retail as part of our core merchandising strategy. For example, we are using data to help our merchandising execution team for M.E.T execute more effectively. M.E.T services based in our stores with primary responsibility for planogram integrity and shelf presentation. Currently, each space serve a space on overall store volume. We are initiating unique service for patients based on category specific sales and transactions. M.E.T. associates will receive individualized and optimized work assignments through the first phones. This allows for the most efficient use of passing hours and focuses based service where customers shop most. Looking ahead, we will continue to build capabilities and invest in people, process and technology in order to leverage our data to better serve our customers. Now let me turn our attention to the third quarter. We strive to be the product authority in home-improvement by providing our customers with the best brands at the best value. Our assortments includes many exclusive brands and we are excited to be expanding our launch of PPG branded products, a brand that is being trusted by Pros for over 100 years This quarter we are introducing PPG Timeless Paint. This new product is one coat coverage is available in both interior and exterior paint. PPG\u2019s world class coding technology improves durability saving our customers time and money. Product innovation is also at the forefront of retail strategy. Flooring, both hard and soft has been an excellent growth driver for our business this year and we continue to see great innovation within the category. New to our assortment is an improved vinyl plank flooring from LifeProof. This innovative product features a highly engineered closed cell phone PDC core that delivers rigidity and strength that is lightweight and easy to handle and install. It is also 100% waterproof and scratch resistance and is available in over 40 patterns. This new LifeProof vinyl flooring is exclusive to the Home Depot. We are excited about our upcoming Labor Day, fall cleanup and Halloween harvest events. In the third quarter, as always, we will be offering a variety of special buys and values throughout the store and online to help kick off the fall season. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Ted and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $28.1 billion, a 6.2% increase from last year. Our total company comps or same store sales were positive 6.3% for the quarter with positive comps up 5.8% in May, 5.9% in June and 7.2% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 6.6% for the quarter, with positive comps up 6.6% in May, 6.2% in June and 7% in July, versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $64 million or 0.50%. In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33.7% a decline of 6 basis points from last year. The year-over-year change in our gross margin is explained in largely by the following factor. First, we had nine basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity. Second, we had approximately 8 basis point to our gross margin contraction due to a change in the mix of products sold. And finally, we had 7 [ph] basis points of gross margin contraction due to higher strength than one year ago. In the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 44 basis points to 17.8%. In the quarter, our expenses were $20 million over our plan, due primarily to a true up of our bonus accrual. Even so our operating expenses as a percent of sales were better than our plan due to our strong sales deployment. One last comment on expenses. As we told you last quarter, we expect our expense growth factor to vary by quarter giving year-over-year comparisons and the timing of investments. Looking ahead, we expect our expense growth factor to be lower in the back half of the year than it was in the first half. Our operating margin for the second quarter was 15.9% an increase of 38 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter grew by $21 million to $249 million, keep reducing the impact of adding $4 billion to our outstanding long term debt over the past year. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.6% compared to 37% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 reflecting the benefit of a new stock compensation accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of the year. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $2.25 an increase of 14.2% from last year. Moving onto some additional highlights, in the first six months of the year, we opened four new stores, including three in the U.S. and one in Mexico. We have now opened a new store in the United States since 2013. Our New York store still open void, and we are pleased with their initial sales performance. Total sales per square foot for the second quarter were $464 up 5.9% from last year. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $12.9 billion, up $545 million from last year and inventory turn were 5.3 times, up one tenth from last year. In the second quarter, we repurchased $2.6 billion or approximately 17.3 million shares of outstanding stock bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to approximately $3.9 billion. Additionally, during the quarter, we took advantage of an attractive interest rate environment and raised $2 billion of incremental long-term debt. We will use the proceeds of this debt issuance to repurchase outstanding shares, increasing our 2017 share repurchase target from what had been $5 billion to now $7 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long term debt and equity for the trailing 12-month. Return on invested capital was approximately 32%, 300 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Year-to-date our sales and earnings per share have exceeded our expectations. Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we expect to see continued growth in the repair and remodel market as [Indiscernible] has experienced solid waste growth, faster home price appreciation and the re-emergence of first-time homebuyers. As a result, we are looking at fiscal 2017 sales and earnings per share growth guidance to reflect our first half performance and are confident in the back half of the year. An addition as Craig mentioned, we recently completed the acquisition of Compact Power equipment and are excited to welcome the Compact Power team to the Home Depot family. As we look to the back half of the year, Compact Power will not have a material impact to our sales or earnings per share forecast, but it will slightly affect our gross margin and expense structure. We now expect fiscal 2017 sales to increase by approximately 5.3% with positive comps of 5.5%. While this suggests our second half comps will be slightly lower than our first half comps, our sales guidance is based on our planned foreign exchange rates for the back half of the year. Given the recent performance of the U.S. dollar, there could be some upside to our sales forecast. At the beginning of the year, we expected our fiscal 2017 gross margins to decline by 15 basis points from what we reported in fiscal 2016. Reflecting the impact of Compact Power, we now expect our fiscal 2017 gross margin to decline by approximately 10 basis points. For the year, also reflecting the impact of Compact Power, we now expect our expenses to grow at approximately 46% of the rate of our sales growth. Finally for the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.3%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off GAAP. For fiscal 2017, we now expect diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 13% to $7.29. Our updated earnings per share guidance reflect the points I just mentioned as well as $7 billion of share purchases for the year. So we thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Debbie, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first today to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks, good morning. Quick question I guess on the recovery. The longer the recovery persist, I mean just natural it seems like the market is getting some angst, that there is eventually going to be a shoot or drop. How do you get comfortable with the tenure of the recovery, clearly the business is performing great, and if there are yellow flags, how do you know what you are looking for?\nCraig Menear: I mean, I\u2019d say Simeon that we\u2019ve had obviously a protracted recovery here, and it has been clearly driven from housing which has been a steady but slow recovery in the market. You know we continually look at months of supply, there is 4.3 months of supply in the market of housing availability against a historical norm of six, that clearly is helping to drive improvement in home value appreciation, but housing starts haven\u2019t returned to their norm yet either. The only thing that\u2019s kind of run on an historical averages is housing turnover. So, we see this housing favorability continuing as we look forward. And I think the watch out for us is, you wouldn\u2019t want to see affordability become an issue, but that at this point doesn't seem to be a concern for us at all.\nCarol Tome: Right. As we look at the affordability index, it stands at 153%, so long ways to go before that would be a watch out for us. And recovery is a difficult thing to put your arms around. But if you look at simply PFRI dollars they\u2019ve only recovered 70% of the loss. So, if you put that into baseball terms like [Indiscernible] 6 [Indiscernible]. The other thing that\u2019s really interesting to us is the age of the housing stock. We\u2019ve talked to you a lot about 66% of the housing stock being older than 30 years. Did you know that 51% of the house stock is older than 40 years and as houses age, well, they need more of repair.\nCraig Menear: It\u2019s more spend.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. My follow-up is one e-commerce and I\u2019m sure this will be topical. I just want to ask one angle of it. So, in using the power tool category as an analog for how to think of appliances, the pushback that we been getting is that look Home Depot has done a great job in powered tools, but they have a lot of exclusive brands and labels which is different than appliances, and ultimately appliances will be harder to control given some of the large national brands. Can you can you share some thoughts on that comment?\nCraig Menear: Look, what I would say is, we have a lot of categories of goods in our stores, over 200 plus categories of goods. And we compete with lots of folks across all of those categories. And candidly by category the strategy is different because the categories are different. And so, our job is to create the strategies that allow us to be the customers\u2019 advocate for value across the categories and compete accordingly. And it varies by category what our approach is.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions on market share. First, it looks like your total sales increased slightly less than the category according to the Census Bureau. So where do you think you might have lost some share to during the quarter? And then I have a follow-up on that.\nCraig Menear: Actually based on the NAICS 441, it actually looks that we gained share in the quarter. We don't believe we lost share in the quarter.\nCarol Tome: No. We\u2019re up 20 basis points.\nCraig Menear: Yes. 20 basis points year-over-year.\nTed Decker: 20 bps to 28.12.\nCraig Menear: Right.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. And then the second part of the question is on e-commerce, the e-commerce channel within home improvement overall. Do you think that you're gaining share within that channel within the category? And what rate of growth do you think the home-improvement category is growing online?\nCraig Menear: So, we actually have an interconnected retail approach and our customers are blending the physical and the digital world together. And we look at share in totality as it relates to Home Depot's gain in the market against what the market is growing.\nCarol Tome: And we\u2019re pleased with the share gains. It\u2019s important to remember that over 43% of our online transactions are picked up inside of a store. This is One Home Depot. Not an online or in-store business, but it\u2019s One Home Depot.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDan Binder: Thank you. As you just mentioned different strategies for different categories online, obviously appliances have been in the news recently, I know you do some of your appliance business online. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the complexity of that transaction, how the customers shopping it in the store even if they're ordering it online and where you think your competitive advantages are if you start to see that category become more available online at other competitors?\nCraig Menear: Dan, look -- if you look at the interconnected experience, candidly for appliances, there are lots of other categories. In many, many categories the shopping experience starts in the digital world even though it might finish in the physical world or in some cases actually finish in the digital world as well. It is truly a blended experience today where the customer, the front door of our store is no longer at the front door of our physical store for many, many product categories. The customer starts digitally looking at product, doing research and then in many cases particularly in large ticket they come in and they actually want to talk to one of our associates before they make a purchase, but we clearly in big-ticket categories we sell both in the physical and the digital world.\nDan Binder: And then, if I can just ask one other question related to delivery. Can you give us an update on how many of the stores are able to deliver to the Pro within two hours now?\nCraig Menear: Yes. We've actually rolled out the delivery program at the end of fiscal 2016, Mark Holifield is here. I\u2019ll let Mark\u2026\nMark Holifield: Yes. Hey, Dan. Our buy online deliver from store and our deliver from store capabilities were fully rolled out at the end of last year and we offer the two and four hour window options at all of them at this point.\nCarol Tome: And Mark, certainly we\u2019ve seen sequential growth in our delivery business every week in the quarter. So our customers are responding very well to this offer.\nMark Holifield: Very healthy growth.\nDan Binder: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about, Carol, last quarter you talked about Pro being up two times DIY. Does that trend continue? And can you talk about the growth that you\u2019re seeing in the Pro versus DIY. What does that make you all think about what's going on in the market now and in terms of the duration of the growth going forward?\nCarol Tome: Sure. So, yes, our Pro\u2019s grew twice as fast then the DIY, actually expanded that gap a bit in the second quarter. And Chris, I can recall talking to you last August about our sales, our Pro\u2019s going out on vacation. Well, based on what we\u2019re seeing in the stores today our Pros are not on vacation. The stores are busy and our sales are quite good.\nChristopher Horvers: Nice. And then, I think one of the questions that was asked on our last that was really interesting and I wanted to put out there. You have companies like Wayfarer spending a lot in advertising in Amazon reported to be more interested in the category. So, obviously as you saw these companies get rewarded with sales growth and not necessary profitability clear in Amazon's last report. So do you think that given this increased interest in greater advertising spend, do you need to flex some muscles here and maybe deleverage advertising a little bit to defend the Home Depot brand in the home related categories?\nCraig Menear: Chris, I\u2019d say, one of things, I\u2019m very proud of the team. They have worked really hard over the past several years to drive dramatic improvement in terms of the effectiveness of our marketing dollars to reach a customer in a space where they have a high level of interest. So, we have been on a path to balance our approach in terms of marketing both in traditional media and in digital media, and the team has been able to drive incredibly effective returns on our marketing spend.\nCarol Tome: We spend more on digital on the second quarter than we did TV and radio combined. So the team is doing an awesome job at getting more eyeballs, higher return on that spend.\nTed Decker: Yes. Our overall advertising spend is up, lower single digits, but as we\u2019ve essentially made more significant pivot to digital marketing it's over half our marketing right now. That's a medium that you can get good insight on the return on your spend and as Craig said, the team just done a great job continuing to increase the return on that spend, so leveraging that low single digit to a much more productive return on overall ad spend.\nChristopher Horvers: I\u2019m sure you do a lot of key search terms and so forth there. Is that becoming more expensive to you as Wayfarer and Amazon focus more on the category?\nCraig Menear: I mean, it various by category by day candidly.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. Thanks very much.\nCraig Menear: Yes.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel: Nice quarter.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: So my first question, I guess is follow-up on some of other e-commerce type questions, but maybe to exactly Chris was saying some minute ago. You other e-retailers are online only chance if they may at least indicate some interest gain into this category. But from your vantage point are you seeing anything suggest that anyone\u2019s coming out with the much, much more price aggressive effort in one that you would have to match or you choosing to match?\nCraig Menear: I mean, Brian, we\u2019ve invested obviously in tools and capabilities to inform our merchants in terms of the overall competitive position in the marketplace both in the digital and in the physical world. And this quite candidly has been something that the company has been focused on since its inception in terms of making sure that we\u2019re driving value. Core belief that I have is as merchants, we are the customer\u2019s advocate for value period. And that's the job of the Home Depot and the Home Depot merchandising team every single day. So we must stay focused on a competitive offering and quite candidly value is defined by what the customer is willing to pay for it.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. And my follow-up question and shifting gears a bit, flooring. I think you call that out another bright spot. Again, from a competitive standpoint there's been \u2013 there\u2019s others companies now they are pushing to the flooring [Indiscernible] perspective. Overall what do you see as far as, I guess, how would you characterize the consumer demand of the category than are you see anything from stepped-up competitions you had to react to?\nTed Decker: As Craig said, it's a great point we competed over 220 categories. Flooring is a very big category and there are actually lot of competitors have been and will be. We see consumer demand very strong and the consumer is responding to the Home Depot value proposition. So we have innovative product. We have exclusive product. We have new technology and exclusive launches at the Home Depot. And we've worked very hard on her in-store selling model and Ann and her team are just doing a great job communicating that value to the customer in both are hard and soft flooring and they\u2019re both doing extremely well as I called out double-digit comps for the category.\nBrian Nagel: Thank you. Congrats again.\nTed Decker: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Kate McShane with Citi Research.\nKate McShane: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was curious about your comment with regards to the reemergence of the first time home buyers. Is this the first time we\u2019re seeing this and if this were emerging would this be enough to offset any slowing of price appreciation if there were to occur?\nCarol Tome: Well, its really interesting to see what happens with the first-time homebuyers in the second quarter. The highest number of first-time homebuyers since 2005. About 424,000 first-time homebuyers making up 38% of all homebuyers and up 11% year-on-year, so that\u2019s good news. Why? Because first-time homebuyers tend to buy homes that need repair and remodel. So, as we see and we anticipated this happening with millennials coming into an age where they start to form families, children or pets or whatever their family unit might look like they're moving into the home which bodes very well for us and to your point it extends the recovery.\nKate McShane: Thanks. Great. Thank you. And then, Ted had mentioned that the three events you conducted during the quarter. Just wondered if that deferred in any way versus last year and does that help explain some of accelerations into July?\nTed Decker: They were similar events in duration as last year, Kate.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Fassler: Thanks a lot and good morning. My question relates to your discussion of sales trends by ticket. Can you just remind us whether that store-only, whether that's inclusive of online? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nCraig Menear: Yes. It\u2019s all in.\nCarol Tome: It\u2019s all in.\nMatt Fassler: I guess, is there anything about the way consumers are shopping based on project or basket that would change the composition of that sales performance by ticket, just thinking about the outsize, extended outsize growth of the big-ticket piece and the fact that the small ticket piece has been growing at a slower rate for kind of equally consistent period of time.\nCraig Menear: The biggest driver behind that has been the recovery of our Pro customer and the growth that we've had in categories like appliances and flooring. Those are big-ticket purchases in and of themselves, so an appliance is clearly much larger than our average ticket. Our flooring job is significantly larger than our average ticket. And our Pro customer spends dramatically more than the average DIY customer. So those have clearly helped to drive the growth in tickets above $900. And then, we did see the recovery in the smaller ticket, Matt, as a result of the garden business coming back to a more normal state in the second quarter.\nMatt Fassler: Great. Thank you so much, guys.\nCraig Menear: Yes.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill: Hi, good morning and thanks.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nDennis McGill: One more question just going back to appliances and online, I think you said, 6% of sales are online now for the total store. Can you just maybe just fame appliances relative to that number and just give a little bit more detail on how you mentioned, Craig, the buying experience in some cases starting digitally and ending digitally. What percentage of those big-ticket transactions and appliances are executed online? Just kind of give some frame of reference to the categories as a whole already being an online category?\nCraig Menear: We don\u2019t break that data. I mean, for a competitive reasons we would not share that data. Thanks.\nDennis McGill: Okay. I won\u2019t count that as my question. And so my question is will shift to non-online. When you look at outdoor garden I guess for the first half of the year it\u2019s a below-average categories, so I guess the weather comps year-to-year didn't really get the typical bathtub affect? Carol, when you look at the back half of the year do you expect that some of that could come back and the full year would balance out or is that lost demand at this point?\nCarol Tome: Some of the softness was \u2013 and softness is relative to the category grew, so [Indiscernible] and Ted, I wouldn\u2019t think we get much of that.\nTed Decker: No. I think some of the uptick we saw in July was that extended season all in, it was a reasonably good season, I wouldn\u2019t say great, certainly colder and wetter early and it was really wet into end of June, so some late garden, but I think we\u2019ve seen that and it just isn\u2019t that big until you get into fall and then hopefully you\u2019ll get a seed season and some planning season.\nDennis McGill: Okay. And then, second question just as it relates to inventory, Carol, how would you characterize inventory in the channel today when you just first store or same-store in the acquisitions and so forth thus far as what a supplier might be facing with projects and so forth. Is there less inventory throughout the channel today and if so can you quantify that in anyway?\nCarol Tome: We\u2019re growing inventory to support ourselves. We also want to drive productivity as Craig called out in his remarks. And so we\u2019re always going to look to improve the velocity of our inventory return that might going to press us. As Craig always said, the customer service starts with in-stock, you got to have with the customers want and certainly we will do that working with our supplier partners.\nDennis McGill: So the inventory, I think turn into a frame earlier being earlier been up a little bit, is that a same-store representation?\nCarol Tome: That is One home depot representation includes inventory in our stores and in our distribution centers.\nCraig Menear: Yes. The total inventories are 545 million in the quarter.\nDennis McGill: Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Alan Rifkin with BTIG Corporation.\nAlan Rifkin: Thank you very much for taking my question. Carol, you mentioned that the expense factor in the second half should be lower than in the first half. Given the fact that typically second half revenues and aggregate are less than the first half and you said that you forecasted comps to be a little bit lower in the second half versus the first half. Is the reason for a lower expense factor in the second half entirely due to compact power or are there other things going on there?\nCarol Tome: Let me give you a little bit more color on our expenses that I put in place. As you know we stepped up our capital spending program this year taking our total spending up to $2 billion including $359 of capital to invest in our stores and certain of our stores are getting new wayfinding package, new flooring and lighting, new restrooms, break room and so and so forth. That capital comes with the next step. Now, we didn\u2019t plan for the activity over every quarter and in fact a lot of that activity took place in the second quarter. And so I look at our expense performance in the second quarter, but it was planned, expenses related to our store investment which would include old write-offs with old fixtures and reset expense and that sort of thing. Year-on-year it was up $19 million. So it was pretty lumpy in the second quarter. That won\u2019t be as lumpy in the back half of the year and that\u2019s really the driver of expense growth factor first half versus second half.\nAlan Rifkin: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. And then follow-up, with respect to Compact Power either Craig or Carol, could maybe just talk about the margin structure for that business. Would it be correct to assume that it\u2019s a lower gross margin, as well as lower SG&A business and what effect on a full-time basis to EBIT margin does the acquisition of Compact Power in and of itself has?\nCarol Tome: Happy to talk about it. First, the Compact Power, the revenues for Compact Power are recognized on a net and not a gross basis. So you have gross margin associated with that business, it\u2019s highly margin accretive. And Alan, that\u2019s one reason why our gross margin guidance for the year has change from what had been down 15 basis points to now down 10 basis points. Because the revenues are recognized on a net basis and because there are expenses in Compact Power it put some pressure on our expense growth factor for the year. We had guided that the expenses would grow at 43% of our sales growth. We\u2019re now suggesting 46% of our sales growth, that\u2019s because there are no revenues we will report on net basis, but they are expensive. If you look at EBIT of Compact Power, its very accretive. In the back half of the year this is a small business, strategically very important. But in the back half of the year Compact Power should contribute a penny of EPS accretion.\nAlan Rifkin: Okay. Thank you very much, Carol.\nCarol Tome: Welcome.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Carol, you\u2019ve already highlighted how the housing stock in the U.S. continues to age. And obviously, that\u2019s been a pretty big thing for you over the last, call it, two years or so. Do you happen to -- I know it\u2019s something you guys have been looking at for a while. So do you happen to have any analytics around the home improvement spending maybe by vintage or do you know if there's an average percentage spend relative to an average home price?\nCarol Tome: Yes. A couple of data points. Homes build before 1980, the average annual home proven spent is $3500 a year. Homes build after 2000 the average annual home improvement spent is $1500 a year. So there\u2019s a pretty nice delta as the homes age. The other interested data points and we haven\u2019t proven this analytically in our own research, but I\u2019ll share with you anyway because I think it gets very interesting. We look at John Burns Real Estate Consulting Group a lot. We\u2019ve got some really interesting data in housing. And they say, that for average every percentage point improvement in real wages and real wages are up this year after inflation 2.2%. They say for every percentage points increase, there\u2019s a 1% increase in the repair and remodel spend. Interesting, we haven\u2019t proven that, but it stands to reason. You got more money in your pocket you\u2019re going to spend some more money on your home.\nScot Ciccarelli: Yes. That makes sense. And then just a quick follow up. You also mention how first-time home buying is finally starting to accelerate. Again that should be good for duration, but just based on historical purchase patterns would you expect that the impact your small ticket performance? Presumably there's a little \u2013 a lot more kind of nickel dime type projects that are probably done, but I don't if that's true or not.\nCarol Tome: I wouldn\u2019t think so. No, because when they\u2019re going into the homes they need to repaint them. And paint is not just a bucket of kind of put it down and paint, but it\u2019s a tape and tarps and all the other stuff that goes with it.\nTed Decker: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t think so other than a trip for picture hanging or something like that, that would be under $50, but yes, your -- which we like.\nCarol Tome: Which we like, yes.\nTed Decker: Older basket.\nScot Ciccarelli: Right. So no real change in the cadence between big ticket and small ticket as you windup getting more first time home buying?\nCarol Tome: Still think so.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Keith Hughes with SunTrust.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. You mentioned several times earlier in the call that your Pro is up well in excess with the DIY. Can you give us any insight on product categories that they particularly well with the Pro in the quarter?\nTed Decker: Well, certainly our building material categories did very well. Our electrical did very well, tools, consumers, consumer\u2019s love our power tools, but the Pro\u2019s are really the heavy users of that. Lumber is very strong, our lumber prices are nearer at all-time highs, our unit productivity is you know, the commodity prices we know will go up and down, we watch the units very carefully in lumber and building materials, and those have been very strong as well.\nKeith Hughes: And you had mentioned earlier in the call, introduction about the Pro paint initiative. Is that is an area. Is that rank among your tops in terms of revenue of the Pro?\nTed Decker: Yes. The Pro paint initiative that we have with each of their NPPG has been very successful. I'd say overall we\u2019re pleased with our growth in our paint business. I'd say we\u2019re holding shares if not gaining a little bit to share in paint, but our Pro paint initiative in particular is multiples higher growth than our DIY paint business.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scott Mushkin with Wolf Research.\nScott Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess I wanted to take a step back and ask some boarder question. A lot has been asked on the call. I mean, as you guys look at your business, because obviously just performing terrifically and obviously a big tailwind from what\u2019s going on macro, but also lot of the great things you guys are doing. What do you worry about?\nCraig Menear: So, I\u2019d say there two things that are up there on the list. And one is we\u2019re investing in the One Home Depot experience, that\u2019s how the customer views us, not exactly how we\u2019re built, so we have to do some things to get there completely. And you worry about the ability to execute on that fast enough and the change management that comes along with that. Second worry, I\u2019d say, is the customer and their associate experience in our high-volume stores. Clearly, with the growth that we've had that puts pressure on in those stores disproportionately. And so, we\u2019re going to have to invest to solve that situation and we\u2019re working to put that in place, but those are certainly two worries that we have in the business.\nScott Mushkin: Right. That\u2019s really good insight. But I was just wondering if you could talk about kind of how things going so far this quarter, I mean, we had the retail sales numbers out today. There were good. We experience sometimes a third quarter low, because DIY is not as strong as Pro. I was just wondering any thoughts as we look into third quarter, anything we should consider?\nCarol Tome: Yes. Scott, as we mentioned just little bit earlier, we are quite pleased with our sales in August thus far. \nScott Mushkin: All right. Perfect guys. Thanks very much.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt McClintock with Barclays.\nMatt McClintock: Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nMatt McClintock: It\u2019s been a little over a quarter since you now had access to Interline inventory and your stores. And I was wondering conceptually how should we think about the benefit from that access, building and having an impact on your sales? How do you build awareness of that? Is that really what we\u2019re waiting on to see an acceleration in the business form that or just how to think about that benefit layering in over the coming years? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: I mean, I\u2019ll start and Bill is here who runs our Pro and Services business. But as I call out my comments, we\u2019re actually very pleased with the use case one and use case two response from our customers and with that as well as the operative the team at Interline, Interline actually grew above the company average growth in the quarter or so.\nWilliam Lennie: Yes. Craig, thanks, quick comment. We\u2019re now live in 1958 stores, so we basically have finished the rollout. We have 1500 stores that have access to Interline\u2019s products next day and an additional 458 stores that are a two-day delivery. And we\u2019re seeing great activity on a broad base of goods primarily servicing the trades from plumbing electrical hardware also strengthen the HVAC business. So it's doing a nice job of extending our product reach given us access to deeper inventories for Pro that are coming in and looking for project-based purchases. And then, overall, average ticket on par ramping up sequentially week-over-week and pleased with progress on the MRO business.\nMatt McClintock: And then, Carol if I could have a follow-up just \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but the seven basis points of pressure from higher shrink. I have to ask about it because it almost offset the benefit from the supply chain. Could you just talk about what you are seeing there, what\u2019s driving that? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: As you know there are many drivers of shrink including higher staff and changes in operational processes and new systems. We have a cross functional team that is addressing us. We are hearing from other retailers that [Indiscernible] is up across the board. But we really focussed on what have we changed in front of our store that will have to cost some of this. And in fact the cross functional team has identified a few defects that we are correcting. And we will continue to work on this going forward.\nMatt McClintock: Thank you very much for the color.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.\nPeter Benedict: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. First it was just kind of the labor market and wages and availability workers. I mean, what are you guys seeing on that front, whether it be with the seasonal folks that you hire or some of the speciality or full time folks. That\u2019s my first question.\nCraig Menear: So Peter we hired seasonally this year over 90,000 people and one of the great things that happened in this season was we enhanced our application process through improved mobile experience, it actually doubled our applicant pool. So we were pleased with that as a better experience for the applicants themselves and was pretty effective on our end as well. We are certainly seeing wage pressure and that varies market by market, but that\u2019s something that we anticipated and planned for and it\u2019s actually built into our guidance for 2017.\nPeter Benedict: Okay, thank you. And then, Carol just curious on the FX, just to make sure I understand you correctly your guidance right now still assumes, I think it was the $250 million headwind from FX for the years, is that right?\nCarol Tome: In the back half, it\u2019s actually $250 million. That\u2019s right. So if you were to add that back, you would calculate the comp to be about the same as what we reported in the first half.\nPeter Benedict: Okay. And then last one if I could, just sneak one in. The store refreshes that you\u2019ve alluded to, remind us how many you are getting done this year, how many you think you could maybe do in 2018. And Craig, anything specific, I mean you talked about trying to alleviate some of the customer experience and associates experience friction that may occur in these high volume stores. Anything in particular that you are focussed on that you are seeing some improvement from as you kind of work to re-engineer the stores a little bit. Thank you.\nCraig Menear: The first part of the question in terms of how many this year or approximately 500 stores will get the updates that Carol referenced earlier as it relates to signage, navigational signage, lighting, Floor, break room, rest rooms and so on. And then in the high volume stores, you know we have to work to continue to prove the experience for the customer on the front end, in particular and get the customer through the registers with greater speed and then likewise those stores feel more pressure from office and bus pick up and we\u2019re working to solve that for them as well. And that will be a different scenario by different type of stores, but those are the areas of focus.\nCarol Tome: And Peter, you know we\u2019ve got an investor conference in December and so we\u2019ll lay out our plans for 2018 and beyond at that conference.\nPeter Benedict: Okay. Fair enough, thanks so much guys.\nCarol Tome: Debbie, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our last question today from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities\nSeth Basham: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nCraig Menear: Sure.\nSeth Basham: As we look at the trends in small ticket sales relative to big ticket sales, obviously they have been underperforming for some time. Do you think that you are still gaining market share in some of the small ticket categories?\nCraig Menear: Yes, I would. I mean, the small ticket is healthy, we talk about the transactions being up 1.5, but that also comes with a strong positive comp associated with those transactions. And you know the mix of the business we used to talk about under 50 being 20 odd percent and over 900 being 20 odd percent. And that dynamic shifted as the customer has responded we think largely to the product and the innovation in the store. And again, we look at this every single week where are the sales coming from in the assortments and we continue to see the customer respond to the innovation and buy up the continuum on the assortment. An example of that would be in soils and mulch this year. So we talked about garden coming later which it did and we had a fine garden business in the second quarter, but we were a little less promotional on commodity mulch, because what we find is the customer is buying heavily into the organics. We have a number of exclusives in organics with Kellogg's and doctor Herbs and some of the Scotts miracle growth product and customers are happily trading up and we are talking you two and sometimes three and four times the cost for a bag of organic mulch over commodity mulch. So we look at it very carefully because it\u2019s a natural and fair question that we continue to be comfortable with what the dynamic is of ticket growth. We look again that it\u2019s exclusively this year product mix and then the effect of commodity prices, lumber and building materials. There has been no price impact on our AUR.\nSeth Basham: That\u2019s helpful. And given that that\u2019s [Indiscernible] of this call as we think about the e-commerce in fact it\u2019s on the small ticket categories. Do you feel like you guys are better or less well positioned to gain share in some of the smaller ticket categories as a result of what\u2019s happening with the online channel.\nCraig Menear: I mean we feel very comfortable although we competed across all segments of the line structure. Opening price point, mid price point, upper price point across channels.\nSeth Basham: Excellent. Thanks a lot guys.\nCraig Menear: All right.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well thank you every one for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $23.9 billion, up 4.9% from last year. Comp sales were up 5.5% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 6%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67 in the first quarter. We were pleased with the start of the year as we executed within a more normalized spring environment and navigated a tough weather comparison with weather driven and demand that we saw in the first quarter of last year. All three of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps led by our Southern Division. On the international front, both Canada and Mexico posted another quarter of positive comps in local currency. The power of our interconnected retail strategy continues to gain traction in our international businesses as digital sites in both countries were recently updated driving sales growth and positive response from our customers. Turning back to the U.S. we saw a broad based growth across our store as both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter and all merchandising departments posted positive comps. Our commitment to new and innovative products continues to be a contributor of our ticket growth. Our merchants collaborate with our supplier partners to bring innovative and exclusive items to market that delivered value for our customers by saving them time and money. As Ted will detail the extension of Lithium-Ion Battery technology into the outdoor power category is an excellent example of our ongoing focus on innovation and we continue to see great sales in this category. Another engine of growth for our business is the Pro customer. As Pro sales once again outpaced the DIY sales in the quarter, we recognized that Pro customers have needs that go beyond our traditional in store offerings and we believe that the work we are doing to strengthen our sales support, assortment and fulfilment for this customer base continues to resonate. For example, our in store tool room business helps our Pros more effectively run their business. In many cases our partnership with the Home Depot can translate into business for our Pros as we can connect to them with our do-it-for-me customers through our Pro referral platform. We continue to see significant opportunity to help our Pros manage and grow their business while driving higher product pull through and strengthening our relationship with our do-it-for-me customer. Another component of our overall Pro strategy centers on Interline in the MRO customer. Use case 1, to rollout of Interline\u2019s catalogue of products to Home Depot stores is now live in over 1500 U.S. stores. We continue to roll out use case 2 which enables Interline customers to shop Home Depot stores using a swipe card that is linked to their Interline account. Interline sales growth outpaced the company average in the quarter and we remain very excited about the opportunity that Interline provides. The power of interconnected retail creates growth opportunities for the Home Depot. As we invest in this area, we are seeing a positive response from our customers in the form of improved customer satisfaction scores and increased sales. In the first quarter, our online traffic growth was robust and our online sales grew approximately 23%. Our supply chain continues to be a source of strength for our business. The flexibility and nimbleness of our supply chain is a competitive advantage. This is particularly evident during our busy spring selling season when regional weather conditions vary resulting in spiky demand patterns. Operationally, nimbleness and flexibility carries over into our stores. This spring, M.E.T our Merchandising Execution Team helps us drive productivity by reducing merchandising set times by 25%. In Store, associates efficiently manage great flow within the store while remaining focused on providing strong customer service in the aisle. And we hired over 85,000 new associates to ramp up for spring sales with a simplified application process reducing the time it takes to complete an application by upto 80%. The success of our first quarter is a result of each and every one of our associates, and I\u2019d like to thank them for their hard work and dedication to our customers. Looking forward, we plan to continue this momentum. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig and good morning everyone. We had a great first quarter driven by continued strength across the store. Our Pro business was particularly strong and outpaced the company average. We also saw excellent growth in our online business as online sales grew approximately 23%. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. Appliances, Lumber and Flooring had double-digit comps in the quarter. Tools, Electrical, Plumbing, Decor and Kitchen-Bath were above the Company average. Indoor Garden was inline with the company average. Building Materials, Millwork, Hardware, Lighting, Paint and Outdoor Garden were positive but below the company average. In the first quarter, total comp transactions grew by 1.5% and comp average ticket increased 3.9%. The increase in average ticket was positively impacted by a number of things including customers trading upto new, innovative products. Commodity price inflation in Lumber, Building Materials and Copper also positively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 75 basis points. Looking at big ticket sales in the first quarter, transactions over $900 which represent approximately 20% of worldwide [ph] sales were up 15.8%. Few drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were Appliances, Flooring, and Roofing. In the first quarter, sales with our Pro customers outpaced the company average driven by both our high spend and low spend Pros. We saw strong comps in several Lumber categories, Wire, Commercial Industrial Lighting and gypsum [ph] In addition, the core of the store performed well and we saw strength in several maintenance and repair categories across the company. Classes that outperformed the company average included several Flooring categories, Tool Storage, Power Tools and a number of Bath Categories. As Craig mentioned earlier, our customers respond to new and innovative products. A perfect example is the customers\u2019 response when you are seeing a new lithium-ion battery technology in outdoor power. We\u2019ve partnered with the best suppliers put together a line up of tools that is the long lasting power and run time to get the job done without the hassle of gas and chords even with a lawnmower. Our exclusive assortment at Ego and Ryobi Cordless mowers can handle the standard size of Europe with just one charge. In addition for those customers that prefer gas power, we\u2019ve got a powerful line-up led by Honda and Toro that includes 13 of the top 15 rated self propelled gas mowers on the market and all of these are retail exclusives to the Home Depot. Our Spring Black Friday event was a success. Our associates drove excitement around special buys in our stores and online and our customers respond. We saw increased traffic both in-store and on-line and strong comps and categories like Mix & Match Patio, Outdoor Power Tools, Mowers and Chemicals. We strive to balance the art designs of retail. With our interconnected retail strategy, we are continually improving the customer experience by striving to create frictionless shopping across all channels. For example, our new simplified and expedited online checkout process reduces customer\u2019s checkout time by an average of 20%. In addition, we are leveraging our digital assets and big data to better know our customers and in turn better meet their needs to targettted online offerings and localized online experiences. For example, our refreshed mobile app personalizes the user\u2019s home page based on location, customer segment and shopping patterns. We are pleased with the customer engagement in response to these enhancements and we are seeing increased conversion rates. Now let me turn our attention to the second quarter. We continuously introduce innovation and value that save our customers both time and money. A great example of this is the new PPG Timeless Exterior Stain and Sealant. This is the first PPG branded product offered at the Home Depot and is their most advanced endurable line of woodcare on the market, with enhanced oil technology, improved resins, stronger UV absorbers and better water repellency this product provides outstanding, outdoor protection from the elements. PPG Timeless Exterior Stain and Sealant is exclusive to the Home Depot. Another exciting new product is the Ring Outdoor Cam with motion activated floodlight. This is the first high definition security camera with building floodlights, two way talk, automated recording and a siren alarm. The best part is that this product is easy to install next directly to your mobile device so you can monitor your property anytime, anywhere. This product launched exclusively at the Home Depot. In addition, all the new product offerings we are hearing up for our upcoming events in the second quarter. We begin to look out for Thrill of the Grill, Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Fourth of July events where we will be offering more of great value and special bites for our customers. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $23.9 billion, a 4.9% increase from last year. Our total company comps or same store sales were positive 5.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 5.8% in February, 4.3% in March and 6.2% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 6% for the quarter, with positive comps up 6.3% in February, 4.6% in March and 6.8% in April. The cadence of our monthly comps was impacted a bit by weather and by the timing of Easter this year versus last year. Adjusting for Easter, on a like-for-like basis, our U.S. comps were 2.9% in March and 8% in April. Two more comments about our first quarter sales growth. First, for activity purposes, we record comp sales when tender is accepted and we report sales revenue when the transaction is completed. The difference is known as deferred sales. Compared to last year, our deferred sales grew by $116 million. As a result, our reported sales growth was less than our comp sales growth. Second, versus last year fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $71 million. Our total company gross margin was 34.1% for the quarter, a decrease of 9 basis points from last year. As expected, the modest decline in our gross margin was primarily driven by a change in the mix of products sold. For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect our gross margin to decline by approximately 15 basis points from what we reported in fiscal 2016. In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 59 basis points to 20.1%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth along with continued expense control. In the quarter, our expenses were roughly $18 million under our plan, albeit some of the variance was due to timing. While our expenses grew at approximately 39% of our sales growth rate in the first quarter, for fiscal 2017we now expect our expenses to grow at approximately 43% of our sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 14% an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the first quarter of $241 million up slightly from last year. In the first quarter our effective tax rate was 35.2% compared to 36.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The year-over-year change in our effective tax rate was driven largely by a new FASB stock compensation accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2017. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.3%. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.67 an increase of 16% from last year. Now moving to some additional highlights. During the first quarter, we opened two new stores in the U.S. and one new store in Mexico bringing our total store count to 2,281 and selling square footage to 238 million square feet. Total sales per square foot for the first quarter was $394 up 4.6% from last year. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter merchandised inventories were $13.6 billion up $390 million from last year and inventory turns were 4.8 times flat to last year. Accounts payable grew by $427 million year-over-year. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 8.5 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding stocks using access cash, bringing total anticipated 2017 share repurchases to $5 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long term debt and equity for the trailing 12-month. Return on invested capital with approximately 32.3%, 310 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2016. To wrap up the commentary on our first quarter financial results, we were pleased as sales and earnings were better than we planned. Looking ahead while U.S. GDP forecasts are mixed, housing continues to be a growing asset class, and our sales thus far in May have been very good. But relative to our plan we do anticipate some foreign exchange pressure. So today we are reaffirming the sales growth guidance we laid out on our fourth quarter earnings call. For fiscal 2017, we expect sales to increase by approximately 4.6% with positive comps of approximately 4.6%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. Given our first quarter expense performance we are lifting our earnings per share growth guidance. For fiscal 2017, we now expect diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 11% to $7.15. So, we thank you for your participation in today's call and Catherine we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Ari Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Ari Gutman: Thanks. Good morning. Looking at in different markets across the country, can you tell us if you\u2019re seeing a broadening across markets, meaning, if there were some of the laggards out there. Are the speeding up? And then, are you seeing any moderation in some of the faster improving markets?\nCraig Menear: We actually look at the variability of our markets and in the quarter our variability narrowed about 40 basis points year-over-year which was pretty consistent with what we saw in Q4.\nSimeon Ari Gutman: And that narrowing, I guess, can you elaborate if that\u2019s a function of the fast going \u2013 getting slower or some of the slower improving getting faster?\nCraig Menear: It\u2019s really \u2013 we\u2019re not seeing a big change in the regional sales other than where we have some weather impacts.\nSimeon Ari Gutman: Okay. And then my follow-up on flow-through which has been pretty strong and consistent. And it\u2019s a function of both gross margin and the SG&A. We know the guidance for the rest of the year. Thinking really towards the end of this year into next year, anything sort of good guys or bad guys think about that impacts going forward. I mean, now this year gross margin a little weaker because of just mix headwinds, but as you look out a little bit longer term are there anything positive or negative we should think about?\nCarol Tome: Simeon, good morning. So, nothing at this point, and as you know we have an investor conference coming up in December and we\u2019ll give you lot more color about our point of view for fiscal 2018, 2019, and 2020.\nSimeon Ari Gutman: Okay. Appreciate it. Nice quarter.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll continue on to Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nMichael Lasser: Deferred revenue was bigger this quarter than it's been in the past recognized that next quarter. To what degree is that a leading indicator of the business given the nature of the sales that are better in that number?\nCarol Tome: Yes. There were three big drivers of the deferred revenue growth year-on-year. One you\u2019ve heard commentary about our dot-com sales growth, up 23% year-on-year, not all those sales are completed at the time of that we take the tender. Our dot-com sales now make up 6.6% of our total sales. We also saw growth in our services business. Our services business grew faster than our company average and Ted called out flooring as an example. Those were the two biggest drivers of the deferred sales increase.\nMichael Lasser: It is a leading indicator for the next few quarters given what\u2019s going into those numbers?\nCarol Tome: We would anticipate continues strong growth in those categories.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. And then my follow-up questions are on the e-comp business, obviously you\u2019re doing really well through that channel. To what extent is it validating that consumers increasingly want to buy the home improvement product through the online channel and subsequently going to expose you to greater and greater levels of competition?\nCraig Menear: I think the interesting think for us is over 45% of our orders on homedepot.com the customer is actually choosing to pick up into our stores. So they are finding it incredibly convenient to blend the channels and utilize all the assets that we have.\nMichael Lasser: Is that percentage changing at all, Craig, I think you mentioned [Indiscernible]?\nCraig Menear: It\u2019s been growing over the past 12 months.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. Thank you so much.\nCraig Menear: Yep.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.\nSeth Sigman: Thanks a lot, and good morning, and great quarter.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nSeth Sigman: I had a question on big-ticket comps in the quarter. Seems to be one of the key bright spots here where it accelerated up 15.8%. I think you said, you mentioned a couple of categories. Do you think that reflects an acceleration in market share and maybe some of the benefits from company\u2019s specific initiatives in the Pro focus or how do you balance that with also maybe an acceleration and demand trends overall?\nCraig Menear: I\u2019ll start and let Ted comment on this. I do think it's an acceleration of the customer's willingness to spend in big-ticket projects. We\u2019ve seen strong remodel business with our Pro, but then it's also categories that we've invest in as well.\nTed Decker: Yes. I\u2019d add to that. It\u2019s a really all the above that the customers responding to the product and the innovation, certainly there\u2019s some very big-ticket items like appliances where we had double-digit comps again. But across the portfolio as I\u2019d mentioned before we track the purchase patterns from OPP up the line structure and we continue to see willingness and response from the consumer when we\u2019re showing great value on innovative products at higher price points. And then services is going quite well, those obviously are bigger ticket items. In our Pro customer, which here, get a much larger items per basket where you\u2019re driving a project and that's been very healthy as well.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. That's helpful. And then to follow-up on gross margin, mix has been the primary driver of the slight decline. Can you maybe speak to some of the other underlying drivers that you talked about in the past whether it's the productivity and supply chain work and then the partial offset from investments in price, are you seeing a change in the pace for either of those items?\nCarol Tome: Well, let\u2019s talk about supply chain first. Supply chain did contribute one basis point with gross margin expansion in the first quarter. That\u2019s after three basis points of pressure coming from higher fuel costs. Again, like the demand that we had in the first quarter we were very pleased with our supply chain performance. In the first quarter in fact expenses were out plan, so that a good story. And some of the other drivers, its all part of the portfolio that Ted and the Merchants run and is working just the way we want it.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. Question on some of the categories, the double-digit categories specifically flooring, could you just highlight what appears to be well above the industry? Could you talk about what's working there? What\u2019s allowing you to gain share?\nTed Decker: We have a nice mix there. The hard surface flooring had been much stronger over the past couple of years, and we\u2019ve done a lot of work in our showrooms with hard surface flooring particularly with tile and laminate. But recently vinyl plank has been taking off, so luxury vinyl plank manufacturers are now putting a solid core in the products, so you can get much greater use cases about final product. And its -- the efficacy of it and the look is getting better and better and that selling very well. And then soft flooring, soft flooring is not dead, and we simplify and go to market.\nCarol Tome: Long, long process.\nTed Decker: And we\u2019re seeing terrific strength with our soft flooring categories.\nKeith Hughes: And you\u2019re referring to the whole house installation price, is that what you\u2019re referring to in soft flooring?\nTed Decker: Yes.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Second question, regarding big-ticket in general, as referred to, very good in the quarter, how much did the lumber inflation play into the big number you reported there?\nCarol Tome: Lumber was a little more than half of that 75 basis points.\nKeith Hughes: Yes. Little more than half. Okay. That 75 basis points, does that on the whole year comp or just down the growth of the \u2013 I guess, it would be the same actually on the full year comp or the growth of big ticket?\nCarol Tome: That was only on the average ticket growth for that company. In terms of performance of big ticket categories that is more driven by appliances and flooring.\nKeith Hughes: Okay.\nCarol Tome: It\u2019s not so much [Indiscernible].\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel: Nice quarter. Congrats.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: So, couple of questions here. First off, do not to be nitpicky here, but if you \u2013 just a question on the cadence of comps in the quarters. So, Carol when you called out in the U.S. business, I guess, adjusted for Easter. March was 2.9% and then April was 8%. So as we think about that I assume that eight reflects, picking up some of the business that maybe even loss or didn't happen in March because of weather? And how should we about then maybe a run rate \u2013 more normalized run rate there?\nCarol Tome: Right. So, Brian, it was a little choppy in terms of the cadence, and we do think that was weather. If you look at our transactions in March were actually under 1% growth year-on-year and that was all weather-related. And when the weather improved in April the sales came back. So, we always talk to you about bathtub of that first half, but we had a bathtub effect in the first quarter, we did. And so we think now about the first half we would think that the first quarter will be slightly stronger than that second quarter, and the comps for the first half will be about the same as the comps for the back half.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. It\u2019s helpful. Then the second question I had is probably a follow-up to your prior question. With regard to online sales, we have seen a nice tick up here. Craig, you call that, you said 45% the online sales our Buy Online, Pick Up In Store.\nCraig Menear: Right.\nBrian Nagel: The other point, just remaining 55%, is there any color you can give on what people are actually buying online, has it surprise you in any way and maybe then there\u2019s a common on the profitability of those sales versus in-store sales?\nCraig Menear: Let me address the last part and then Kevin Hofmann is here who runs our online business. So let him comment on the sales patterns. When it comes to the profitability it's actually this whole customer engagement is becoming a blended element between online and in-store, and the customer is choosing in some cases, they start the shopping experience online, they finish in-store or they might vice-versa, start the store and actually finish online. And so with 45% of the orders has been picked up, it is truly a blended effort and we look at that way, our merchants manage it as a total portfolio. So they see an entire blended mix of sales for the business. And that\u2019s actually how we run the business. So we don\u2019t focus on it individually by itself.\nKevin Hofmann: And then, Brian, just the sales perspective certainly we see strength across the store. Our bath business has been doing very well. Our flooring business has been doing very well. Plumbing, power tools all doing very well and not to ignore the core building materials products, we see great visit traction Pro\u2019s shopping online, looking for inventory levels, looking at pricing, and that\u2019s been working very, very well for us as well.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. Following up on just how you think about guidance. So, there was a swoon in the late summer last year, I was curious if you had any retrospect on what drove that and as you just think about modeling the business, is the growth in the market, the growth rate and sort of compares don't necessarily matter? Or do you think maybe as we lap through that that pause like it seemed to happen in late summer where you would expect to pick up some extra this year as we approach there?\nCarol Tome: I think with all kind of talked this out a lot, and we think Pros went on vacation. And good for them, they were busy, they\u2019ve got more work and then they know what to do it and they took some times off and then they back hard at work. And to your point should we ignore there? I don\u2019t think you should ever ignore a compare. But clearly there is demand that\u2019s being created by this housing market that is very strong. Home prices are up year-over-year over 5%, housing turnover over 4% and aging and housing stock, household formation. We see growth in private fixed residential investment every quarter. It still a long way to go back to reach back to the mean or 4% -- 4.5% of GDP, so lot of good momentum in our business.\nChris Horvers: So, I guess at that point [Indiscernible] I mean, the compares do ease. We talked about a pretty normal spring, it doesn't sound like there\u2019s any pull forward into 1Q out of 2Q on the spring business. So why isn\u2019t this a 5% to 6% growth business through the balance of the year?\nCarol Tome: So, a few things. First as I mentioned, we\u2019ve go some currency pressure coming our way. We estimate that currently pressure to be $250 million. Second, it is the middle of May and it\u2019s a little early to start thinking about looking for the full year, but as I said, sales as far in May has been very good.\nCraig Menear: I think one of the comment would be, Chris that, while we had a great indoor garden business with power equipment, the outdoor garden business in the first quarter really had come alive, then you saw that in the flatness of our ticket $50 and under. There were parts of the country where it was pretty wet for people to be out, preparing their landscape for planting. So I think that was a factor as well.\nChris Horvers: And then my follow-up is there is anything to as you think about different cycles that you've all seen in this business, seen the traffic number for this quarter, ticket continues to lead which is very encouraging, but at the same time traffic matters. How are you thinking about that in the context of the cycle? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Ted got some really great data on traffic. You might want to share that.\nTed Decker: Yes. So we\u2019d look at the contributors to our transactions by obviously all the different price breaks. And it is as Craig just said; it is an outdoor garden story on the transaction, so that\u2019s why we\u2019d be a little conservative. You obviously have to get some good weather into Q2 to drive that outdoor business. Q1 wasn\u2019t practically good or bad. It was a more normal spring. We were not concerned that there was much of anything pulled forward. So we are expecting that business to come in outdoor garden. And when you talk about the bigger trends, we\u2019ve often mentioned the 40 classes that we track from the prior peak in 2006 and we still have 12 of those 40 top classes of good that have not recovered to the peak. So those tend to be the much bigger product or projects rather involving lot of millwork and building materials. So while we\u2019re seeing a lot of strength in that business and very robust, I called out roofing as a double-digit driver, but that whole portfolio you generally looking at adding square footage to get the big project, driven projects and we\u2019re looking forward to that comment.\nCarol Tome: That sales opportunity by the way is $1.3 billion.\nChris Horvers: Understood. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll continue on to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Fassler: Thanks so much and Good morning everyone. So your online business seemed to reaccelerate from the trend that you saw all of last year. I'm interested in what you think drove that business whether is it tilt towards big ticket or changes that you made? And also for the past couple of years online growth has been strongest in the first quarter. It seems almost like the seasonality is changing. And if you could talk about if there's any rhyme or reason to that would be helpful to understand that?\nCraig Menear: Matt, as you know. As you know, this is an area that we\u2019ve been investing in. And so I think the investments that we\u2019re making is improving the customer experience. And I\u2019ll let Kevin talk about this specific.\nKevin Hofmann: Yes. We\u2019ve been refocused on improving the experience across the whole shopping funnel and we\u2019ve made really large savvy design, last fall we upgraded our mobile app substantially. And those have paid nice dividends for us. From a seasonality perspective I just think you\u2019re seeing core categories that we tend to be strong in online, penetrate well in the first quarter and that what\u2019s drving the growth.\nCarol Tome: Matt, if I could add a couple of numbers. The visits were up 15% year-on-year. Our conversion rate increased 30 basis points year-on-year, so if you\u2019re visits are up and you\u2019re conversion is up, your sales are going to grow. And a lot of that is because of the site experience improvements that Kevin and team has made.\nMatt Fassler: That\u2019s terrific. If we think about that, I\u2019m sure you have data on customer age and you could probably tells from kind of products that you\u2019re purchasing and the kind of products they\u2019re engaging in. If you can give out online transaction, is there sign that the millennial customers disproportionately patronizing enterprise online or is it more evenly distributed across age groups?\nCraig Menear: We actually see it more evenly distributed.\nMatt Fassler: Got it. Thank you so much. And then one piece of cleanup if I could, you gave the comp growth for the biggest ticket basket. Can you give us the comp growth for the small ticket basket [Indiscernible] please?\nCraig Menear: It was flat.\nMatt Fassler: Thank you so much guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll hear from Kate McShane with Citi Research.\nKate McShane: Thank you. Good morning. My question is centered around any potential bankruptcies in the place and if in the space, excuse me. And if bankruptcy were to happen, how does it play up to your business and how would it change what you\u2019re already experiencing in appliances, if anything?\nCraig Menear: We clearly have invested to disproportionately take share in categories that we overlap with key competitors who have been -- having their challenges. And we\u2019re going to continue to focus on trying to capture as much business as we can. It\u2019s in categories like appliances, tools, hand tool, storage. There's multiple categories that we overlap in businesses where we think we can continue to grow share.\nCarol Tome: There\u2019s an appliance retailer that recently announced store closing basically going out of business and we\u2019re seeing sales coming our way and in an environment where they\u2019re liquidating the stores. It\u2019s very\u2026\nCraig Menear: That\u2019s really interesting actually.\nCarol Tome: Yes, very interesting.\nKate McShane: Thank you. And then if I could just follow-up on a bit granular, but I know you\u2019ve highlighted that millwork is an opportunity, but it still trending below the company comp average. What is holding that category back? And do you have any expectations on when that comp could accelerate and what could drive it?\nCraig Menear: As I mentioned, these are much larger projects, you can replace on exterior door to refresh your look or wear and tear, but if you\u2019re going to be getting into a number of interior doors, add windows et cetera to your house, you\u2019re generally doing much larger remodel and one that would likely add square footage to the house. And we\u2019re confident, while that business hasn\u2019t come roaring back just yet. It's healthy. But price appreciation Carol mentioned in housing, this is were people can be much more confident to invest in their home with the confidence that that investment will be rewarded with a higher home value. So they\u2019re very bullish on the state of housing and the likelihood of these much larger projects getting underway.\nCarol Tome: This is really nothing statistic to me. There are 76 million owned households in the United States and of those there are only 3.2 million that having negative equity in their home. And you go back to 2011, 11 million of those household had negative equity in their home. So the amount shows that since 2011 homeowners have enjoyed 130% increase in wealth, if you will, coming from home price depreciation. So on average $50,000 per household. So, you can imagine at some point, to Ted\u2019s point, they\u2019ll take that down out and do a bigger millwork or total remodel job.\nCraig Menear: And I think the other part is where there\u2019s 3.8 months of supply of inventory and housing on the market compared to historical norm of six. Like that actually leans into people thinking about remodel versus move as well.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now hear from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nSeth Basham: My question is around the Pro business. Maybe you could provide some color on the degree of outperformance relative to DIY this quarter relative to recent quarters. That would be helpful?\nCarol Tome: Should I jump in? I\u2019ll be happy to jump in. So our Pro business grew twice as fast as our DIY customer in the first quarter.\nCraig Menear: It was pretty balance between our big-ticket Pro and our small spend Pro as well.\nSeth Basham: That\u2019s helpful. And as it relates to Interline specifically, you talked about some improvements with the use cases and those starting to roll up and get some traction. As you anticipate the balance of the year from those use cases and others you\u2019re working on, would you expect a further acceleration in Interline growth?\nCraig Menear: We are very pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing in Interline. And in use case one, for example I mentioned that we\u2019re at 1500 plus U.S. stores now, and actually seems sales ahead of what we anticipated with that. So, yes, we\u2019re excited about the opportunity with Interline as we go forward.\nCarol Tome: Yes, the sales growth rate was higher than the company average in the first quarter. It\u2019s less than 2% of our sales that we can\u2019t see that in the top line yet, but we will see it as these use cases gain traction.\nSeth Basham: Thank you very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now hear from Matt McClintock with Barclays.\nMatt McClintock: Hi. Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if we could talk about the power of innovation driving both ticket and total sales. What product categories would you say over index on innovation or what you would call the benefit of innovation to those product categories?\nTed Decker: Well, there\u2019s actually a ton. I\u2019ll call out the \u2013 maybe some most exciting and technologically savvy. But when you look across the entire store, we get a distributable monthly report of all the great new innovative products. And it's fascinating to go through it. This is a 200, 300 page report of product every month. It's calling out, it could be lightweight drywall, it could be something as simple as cutting plywood into 4x4 panels to have that pre-cut item for a project, but certainly on the more tacky innovative side the lithium-ion battery technology has to be one of the largest \u2013 we have a full riding tractor, RYOBI tractor available for sale that I've ridden it. You can cut your lawn on battery powered tractor. Craig mentioned the outdoor power. We have the power that the run time of gas on blowers and trimmers and hedge trimmers. We\u2019ve seen it in portable power for many years now and it's now accelerating an outdoor power. And then the second one is LED lighting technology in not just individual A-line bulbs, but you\u2019re now seeing integrated LED in your ceiling fans, in your light fixtures and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving our commercial and industrial lighting that I called out as having such strong comps. Is how you\u2019re getting that integrated fixture, getting all sorts of little bit attractive design elements powered by that incredibly thin lighting form factor. But it goes on. Our LifeProof carpet and our PetProof carpet were technology enables us to offer lifetime stain guarantees on the product. So, really across the whole storage its super exciting, great innovated product that customers are responding to.\nMatt McClintock: Thanks for that. And Carol if I could ask one follow-up, just inventory turns for the quarter were flattish year-over-year. How should we think about inventory as we progress through the remainder of the year? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: Yes. Well, on an unrounded basis inventory turn were slightly better than last year. And for the full year we\u2019re expecting inventory turns to be up year-on-year, a few ten.\nMatt McClintock: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now hear from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Baker: Hi. Thanks guys. Just one more e-commerce question, have you guys \u2013 I\u2019m sure you have \u2013 it\u2019s probably been asked. Just to go over again. What percent, what categories in your storage do you think lend themselves best to online? And in particular I'm curious about how the appliance business does online, is that something that you think can work through that channel? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: Yes. I think we shared number years back that we looked at all of our categories and had segments of the business that we felt would lean more towards the digital world. Those things would be products that were smaller cube, more dense, higher value would lend themselves to that type of business. And so, things like faucets and power tools for example. What's interesting is that we've been in a position to be able to not only grow that business online, but we\u2019ve also been able to grow those categories in store at the same time, and so, that something that we see as a real advantage in our business. And then other categories that maybe the customer actually starts online, but they may finish in the physical world would be things like Floorings and Kitchens and so the research has done there but many times the customer still wants to come in and talk to one of our associates and maybe go through some product and questions that they may have about the process. So it\u2019s really something that we have been watching carefully, but we\u2019ve been incredibly fortunate that we\u2019ve been able to grow both channels really across categories that we think lend themselves to the online business. So \u2013 as customers look a lot on line before they actually come into the store and shop.\nMike Baker: So just a follow up there, are you seeing the people actually transact for appliances online and then the second follow up is have you ever quantified like you know x percent of your products are in that first bucket of lend themselves well to online?\nCraig Menear: No, I mean customers do go online and some customers buy online. Just like some customers buy Patio online. They are comfortable doing that without sitting in it. But again, the majority of our business in those kind of categories are in store and we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time trying to quantify.\nMike Baker: Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.\nCraig Menear: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Alan Rifkin with BTIG.\nAlan Rifkin: Thank you very much. You said that your average ticket growth of 3.9% was boosted in part by new product introduction. Curious like for a given product what is the duration of like the -- that can help contribute to average ticket and what does the pipeline look like for new products in the future? And I do have a follow up.\nCraig Menear: I mean it really varies by category on what the cycle is in terms of product innovation. Historically you could think about a product in a 36 month kind of timeframe. Today those categories or that cycle are ways shorter than that. So it varies quite a bit.\nAlan Rifkin: Okay, thank you. And then certainly you got very solid expense growth in the first quarter which led you to take a full year ratio from 49% down to 43% after getting 39% expense growth in Q1 which is your one of your lower revenue quarters. If you take that together with the fact that comps ease going forward, it would appear that the expense leverage in the following three quarters could even be better than what we saw in Q1, which would maybe lead to a number that\u2019s even below 43%. Is that a correct line of thinking on my part?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Alan, as you know we put out guidance based on our point of view on the business and we always try to do better. If I\u2019ll look at the next three quarters I would say the expense growth factor will be slightly higher in the second quarter and then lower in the third and fourth quarter principally because of year-over-year comparison. But we do like to put out numbers that we can beat.\nAlan Rifkin: Okay, thank you very much Carol.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich: Okay, thanks. Had a couple of questions, kind of follow ups. Carol you mentioned that May was very very good, right.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes.\nGreg Melich: And I know last May there were some -- there were some, I guess, Memorial Day shift that maturity on sort of a 3 or 4 depend on how you look at it. When you say very good, is that a two year or three year stack, how should we think about that in terms of very good and exit rate?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I just look at our \u2013 versus our plan.\nGreg Melich: Always versus the plan.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Always versus the plan\nCraig Menear: Correct.\nGreg Melich: And then the second question and maybe sort of a follow up broader speaking. There is a lot going on in the industry, a lot of change and Craig I think you answered being positioned to help the customer and take that share. Could you talk a little bit maybe about the position in terms of how you work with vendors? It seems like you are getting a lot of innovation in products, maybe from some of those vendors that might be thinking differently about their other ways of getting product to market, could you help us understand that side of the equation, and maybe Ted us well especially given online growth etcetera as to how the vendors are working with you.\nCraig Menear: I mean, I\u2019ll start with a comment and turn it over to Ted. I mean this is an area that we have focused hard on for the past eight to nine years. During the downturn, one of the things that we clearly saw was that if the customer was going to spend money in 2008, 2009, 2010 it was going to be largely around new and innovative products and if that product can help them save time or money they would definitely step in even in those tough economic times. So this has been a focus that Ted and the merchants have had in a big way. And we have a huge focus on collaboration with our supplier partners and we appreciate that we have to win together and two things we always want our partners to know is that when they are looking for volume, there is no better place than the Home Depot that no one is going to drive their volume and their productivity at their production facilities like the Home Depot and a second thing and you notice all the exclusive I called out on my prepared remarks no one can launch a product like the Home Depot and we want to continue working and collaborating with our partners driving their volume and introducing their innovation.\nGreg Melich: Okay. And then I have one follow up with the house-keeping what was private label credit penetration in the quarter and you\u2019ve talked a lot about strength to consumer from housing, I\u2019m just curious how the credit dynamics are looking to gas?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, we were very pleased with our performance in our private label credit card. The penetration grew year-over-year by 20 basis points now stands at 22.6% and we see that the sales on our private label card for our Pro the growth rate was faster than the company average.\nGreg Melich: Great. Thanks.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff: Catherine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Yes, Ma\u2019am. We\u2019ll go to John Baugh with Stifel.\nJohn Baugh: Thank you. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Most of my questions are answered, but I was curious on the Southern division comment being the strongest, is that due to weather compare or demographics or both?\nCraig Menear: Well, the southern division did have the benefit of the $70 million in storm sales year-over-year in Louisiana and there is still some recovery benefit going there, so that was part of the driver for the southern division\u2019s outperformance.\nJohn Baugh: And any weather or excuse me calendar issues to be aware of Carol for the coming quarter or the year? Thank you.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: No. Not that I can think of the timing of the Memorial Day maybe of year-over-year we may have a [Indiscernible] volume to a different fiscal market. I can\u2019t think it better does; we\u2019ll clarify that at the end of the second quarter but no quarter-to-quarter differences, no.\nJohn Baugh: Great. Thank you, good luck.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Okay, thank you.\nDiane Dayhoff: Well thank you every one for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings conference call in August.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation."}], "2019": [{"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-02-26 14:44:06", "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to The Home Depot Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call.

Now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2018 was another record year for our business as we achieved the highest sales and net earnings in company history. Fiscal 2018 sales grew $7.3 billion to $108.2 billion. An increase of 7.2% from fiscal 2017 while diluted earnings per share grew 33.5% to $9.73. And although fiscal 2018 was a record year for our business, our fourth quarter comp sales were slightly below our expectations as the quarter experienced some unfavorable weather. Sales for the fourth quarter were $26.5 billion, up 10.9% from last year. Comp sales were up 3.2% from last year. And our U.S. comps were positive 3.7%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.09 in the fourth quarter. Internationally, Mexico posted another quarter of positive comps in local currency while Canada was essentially flat. As we mentioned on the last quarter's call, our fourth quarter faced tough comparisons given the prior year's approximately $400 million hurricane-related sales that would not repeat, and we have planned for this in our outlook. But as Carol will detail, what we did not plan for was the extent of the unfavorable weather we experienced in all regions throughout the quarter. It was cold. It was snowy. And perhaps worst of all, it was wet. Wet weather delays projects and this was evidenced in our sales performance in the quarter. In fact as Carol will detail, ex weather, our business performed in line with our expectations. And as Ted will discuss while the ticket and transactions grew in the quarter and we saw a growth in both Pro and DIY categories, Pro sales once again outpaced DIY sales in the quarter. And the work that are doing to enhance the service capabilities for our Pros continues to resonate. I am very proud of our associates for continuing to do what they do best: serving our customers. Our merchants, store teams, supplier partners, and supply chain teams did an outstanding job of delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter both in stores and online. In fact, several key accomplishments took place during the quarter. We set record performances on Black Friday and during Cyber Week. Our holiday d\u00e9cor offering and gift center events set new all-time highs. And during the quarter, we reached a new watermark of approximately $2 billion annual visits on homedepot.com with many of these visitors indicating that their next stop is a Home Depot store. In fiscal 2018, we made progress with regard to the one Home Depot investment plan. But, we are still in the early days of our journey. Our strategic effort to drive and enhance interconnected customer experience through investments in both the physical and digital worlds are yielding solid returns. We also continue to focus on productivity as a virtuous cycle by leveraging technology and improving processes throughout the value chain of our business. Fiscal 2018 provided a lot of great learning and momentum that we will continue to build on in 2019. I am particularly excited about the investments we are making for our Pros. In the quarter, we announced a consolidated go-to-market approach for our Pro customers under the banner Home Deport Pro. And we continue to invest in a more personalized offering for our Pro customers with a new B2B Web site experience. We have now on-boarded over 100,000 Pro customers and the reception has been positive, our plans for continuous enhancements with new features and capabilities. For example, in response to customer feedback we are adding the ability for businesses to enhance account management and ordering capabilities with improved tools. Our intent is to roll out this new Pro online experience to over a million Pros in 2019. Beyond B2B personalization, we continue to make great strides in driving our digital experience. This year we invested in our Web site and mobile applications improving search capabilities, site functionality, and product content. This ongoing investment in our digital properties has increased traffic and conversion. Versus prior year on a like-for-like basis, online sales grew 22.7% in the fourth quarter and 24.1% in fiscal 2018, now representing 7.9% of our total sales. While we are seeing significant in our online sales, these online shoppers to the relevant to our stores has approximately 50% of our online U.S. orders are picked up in our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. We continue to rollout automated lockers in our stores to make - picking up an online order easier and more convenient. Today, approximately 1,000 stores have lockers with more to come in 2019. Customer sponsored lockers has been very positive. As almost 94% of customers raided their locker pickup experience a five out of five stars. We fundamentally believe that when a customer comes to one of our stores, it has to be a great experience. With our investment program approximately 40% of our U.S. stores now have a new look and feel and customer response has been very positive. The store investments are not just about the customer response as we're also seeing increase in social engagement and higher productivity. Another key component of a best-in-class interconnected shopping experience centers on enhanced the delivery and fulfillment options. Fiscal 2018 was the year of the pilot as [technical difficulty] $1.2 billion investment journey to create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement goods. We are now live with a number of these pilot facilities. We'd look to fiscal 2019 as a year to take what we have learned in pilot and begin the role of that we expect to complete by 2022. At a demonstration of the confidence in the business going forward. Today, our board announced a 32% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.36 cents per share. The board also authorized new share repurchase program of $15 billion replacing our existing authorization. We remain committed into maintaining discipline capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. Turning to 2019 and beyond, I'm excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us Carol will take you through the details. But we expect 2019 to be another year of growth. With sales growth of approximately 3.3%, top sales of 5% and diluted earnings per share of approximately $10.03. Our strong performance in fiscal 2018 also positions us well with respect to our 2020 financial targets and today we are reaffirming those targets. It's an exciting time to be part of the Home Depot and we look forward to the work ahead as we continue our journey to create the one Home Depot experience. There's a great deal of change being introduced throughout the business but as they always do, our associates are rising to the occasion, meeting new challenges head-on, without losing the passion to serve our customers that has made the Home Depot what it is today. I want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. For the second half of the year, 100% of our stores will receive success sharing, our bonus program for our hourly associates. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2019, and with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig, and good morning everyone, when we look through the unfavorable whether we experienced in the fourth quarter we were pleased with how the business performed. Looking at our departments, comps and tools appliances to the core indoor garden building materials outdoor garden hardware and paint were above the company average. Electrical, plumbing, flooring bill work and kitchen and bath were positive but low the company average due primarily to price deflation, lighting and lumber recorded low to mid-single digit negative comps. In the fourth quarter, average ticket increased 2.3% and comp transactions increased 0.9%. The fourth quarter finished, what was a volatile year in many commodity markets, particularly lumber. For example, during the second quarter [technical difficulty] prices were more than 40% higher than they were in the year prior. These prices fell significantly during the third and fourth quarter and now sit approximately 25% below last year's prices. While this deflation pressure sales we've seen strong unit growth as prices have come down and this unit productivity drives activity across the store. During the fourth quarter deflation and lumber negatively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 41 basis points. However, this deflation was largely offset by inflation and other core commodity categories and that impact the average ticket from core commodities of negative 8 basis points. During the fourth quarter, big ticket comp transactions for those over $1,000 which represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales were up 4.8%. A number of factors served these headwinds to big ticket sales in the fourth quarter. Notably unexpected like weather across the U.S. and laughing last year's hurricane related sales. Excluding hurricane affected markets, we see the January's big-ticket comp was up almost double-digits in line with what we saw throughout 2018. Big ticket categories like vinyl plank flooring, roofing, and appliances all had comps above the company average in the fourth quarter. We saw growth with both our pro and do-it-yourself customers in the fourth quarter. With pro sales growing faster than the company's average comp. We continue to see strong performance in pro heavy categories like power tools, water heaters and commercial and industrial lighting. Sales to our DIY customers grew year-over-year as our customers completed a variety of interior projects. Categories like card window coverings, safety and security and cleaning all posted strong growth in the quarter. We also saw record performance for their annual gift center and holiday sets. Additionally, the combination about standing values from our suppliers', right assortments from our merchants and phenomenal execution in our stores led to the single highest sales day in our company's history on Black Friday. As part of our journey to enhance the one Home Depot experience, we are significantly investing our digital assets to provide a frictionless interconnected shopping experience. Earlier this year, we formed approximately 50 cross functional swats focused on agile development to improve our online customer experience. These teams have accomplished a great deal in a short period in our driving results. In 2018 we had a milestone of approximately 2 billion online visits and our ongoing efforts to improve the interconnected customer experience have led to a consistent improvement in our conversion rates throughout the year. However, our work is not done. In 2019, we will continue to rollout enhancements across our digital assets. As you heard from Craig, we're excited to be rolling out a new B2B online experience for our pro customers to provide a more tailored, personalized offering and for consumers we will continue to focus on improving the way we bring our service to life in the digital world. As we looked at 2019, we are excited to build on our momentum. We are the number one retailer for product authority and home improvement and together with our supplier partners. We will work to offer the best products at the best value for our customers every day. A great example of our strong partnerships is in our paint business. Our exclusive partners bear in PPG brings the two highest rated consumer paint and stain brands to the Home Depot. These strong brands along with a great execution in our stores, help drive paint comps above the company average and fourth quarter. We are particularly pleased with our sales to our pro painters as our investments and initiatives are gaining traction. In addition to having the best products, we are investing to improve the in-store paint experience for our customers. In 2019, we plan to rollout a new color solution center to all stores and we'll do a full reset in exterior states. We are thrilled with the results we are driving in our paint business and look forward to building on our momentum in 2019. Product innovation is resonating with our customers as we see them trade up to new features and innovation across the store. One example we are seeing this is with Traeger in our grill category. Traeger is one of the fastest growing brands in the grilling category. Their innovative pellet grills. Traeger offers the versatility and convenience of being able to grill, smoke, bake, roast, sprays for barbeque all in the same grill. Giving the strong sales, we are introducing Traeger's new lineup of live fire grills. This technology connects the grill directly to your smartphone, so you can monitor your grill or adjust the temperature remotely. We are excited to be Traeger's exclusive partner in the big-box Home Improvement Channel. Another example of innovation is in our pro heavy roofing category. Over the last several years, we have seen both residential and commercial roofers trade up for innovative products that save them time and money. In the residential space, we've seen a significant shift from strip shingles to laminate architectural shingles. These laminate shingles last longer have a lifetime warranty are easier to install and offer dramatic color contrast in dimension which is important from a decorative perspective. In the commercial segment the trend is shifted from asphalt and aluminum roof coatings to - roof coating that are more water and dirt resistant. A great example of this is Henry Tropi-Cool Silicone, an exclusive to the Home Depot and Home Improvement channel. No primer coat is needed so the one code application saves time and money. We're excited about the year ahead particularly with the spring selling season right around the corner. Our investments in localized assortment and innovative products in everyday low prices will continue to position us as the product of authority in home improvement. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Ted, and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter total sells for $26.5 billion, 10.9% increase from last year. And for the year, our sales totaled a record $108.2 billion, 7.2% increase from last year. Fiscal 2018 included a 53 week which added approximately $1.7 billion in sales to the fourth quarter and the year. The extra week is not included in our comp sales calculation. Our fourth quarter results also included the impact of a new revenue recognition standard that we adopted at the beginning of the year. In the fourth quarter, the change in revenue recognition positively affected sales growth by $86 million. Our total company comps were positive 3.2% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.1% in November, 3.1% in December and 3.3% in January. Comps in US were positive 3.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 3.4% in November, 3.5% December and 4.1% in January. There were a few notable factors that affect our comp performance in the quarter. First a stronger US dollar negatively impacted total company comp sales growth in the quarter by approximately $96 million or 0.4%. Second the commodity price inflation, we experienced in the first three quarters of the year disappeared in the fourth quarter. Finally, as you know we were up against nearly $400 million of hurricane related sales. We expected that but we did not expect such a wet winter. Sometimes weather driven demand can help sales growth sometimes hurt. Relative to our expectation we estimate weather driven the demand negatively impacted fourth quarter comp sales by roughly 85 basis points. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 34.1% an increase of 19 basis points from last year. The year-over-year change in our gross margin reflects the following factors. First the new accounting standard drove $168 million of gross profit or 53 basis points of gross margin expansion. Second higher supply chain and the filament expense because the proximate 19 basis points of gross margin contraction. Third higher shrink in one year ago resulted in 10 basis points of contraction. And finally changes in the mix of products sold drove 5 basis points a contraction. For the year we experienced 29 basis points of gross margin expansion. In the fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percent of sales increased by 79 basis points to 21.3% due to the following factors: First, we experienced 152 basis points at expense leverage in BAU or Business As Usual Expenses. The strong leverage in the core of our business was driven by solid expense control but also reflects certain expense items that did not repeat this year most notably a onetime bonus of $117 million that was granted to our - associates last year. Our BAU expense leverage was offset by the following. First as we called out in our press release. As we move forward with our B2B experience, we recognized an impairment loss of $247 million or 93 basis points of expense deleverage related to the write-off of several trade names associated with Interline brands. Second, the new accounting standard resulted in a $168 million increase to our operating expenses and caused 63 basis points of operating expense deleverage and third expenses related to our strategic investment plan of roughly $198 million resulted in approximately 75 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Fiscal 2018 operating expense as a percent of sales was 20% an increase of 49 basis points from last year. Our fiscal 2018 expense performance was better than our initial expectations driven by productivity in BAU. For the year, we incurred almost $700 million of expenses related to our strategic initiatives in line with our plan. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was 12.8% and for the year was 14.4%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter grew by $19 million to $265 million reflecting for the most part a loss on the sale of a non-strategic asset. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.7% and for fiscal 2018 was 23.6%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter and the year reflects the close out of the provisional charge we took last year related to Tax Reform and certain positive audit settlements. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.09, an increase of 37.5% from last year. For the year, diluted earnings per share were $9.73 an increase of 33.5% compared to fiscal 2017. Our fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by approximately $0.16 due to the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter. So moving on to some additional highlights, during the year we opened three new stores including one in the U.S. and two in Mexico for an ending store count of 2,287, selling square footage at the end of the year was 238 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per square foot increased 7.2% to $447, the highest in our company history. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories grew $1.2 billion to $13.9 billion and inventory turns were 5.1 times flat with last year. The growth in our inventory versus last year reflects the investments we are making to accelerate merchandising resets and higher in stock levels than we had one year ago. Moving onto capital allocation, in fiscal 2018 we generated approximately $13.3 billion of cash from the business and used that cash as well as the proceeds from $2.2 billion of net debt issuances and cash on hand to invest in the business paid dividends to our shareholders and we purchase our shares. During the year, we invested approximately $2.4 billion back into the business through capital expenditures. So further, we paid $4.7 billion in dividends to our shareholders. And finally during the year, we repurchased approximately $10 billion or about 54.3 million of our outstanding shares including roughly $4.5 billion or 25.7 million shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 44.8%, 1060 basis points higher than the end of fiscal 2017. Today's press release includes our guidance for fiscal 2019. And I want to take a few moments to comment on the main points. Remember that, we guide off GAAP for fiscal 2019 guidance to a loss from our reported results for fiscal 2018 which includes sales and earnings associated with the 53rd week, when we report our quarterly cost sales results, we will compare weeks one through 52 in fiscal 2019 against weeks two to 53 in fiscal 2018. So with that, turning to our sales growth projections, as you know we use a directionally correct but imperfect model to project our sales growth. It starts with GDP. While we are in the 10th year of economic recovery, U.S. GDP is expected to grow in 2019. And for our model, we are using 2.6% GDP growth. To GDP, we add the expected spending impact from key housing metrics, including home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation, and the age of the housing stock. As we look to 2019, most housing metrics are trending positive, albeit heading towards stability. Two of these metrics we're highlighting are home equity, which is a function of home price appreciation, and the age of the housing stock. Home equity has more than doubled since 2011. And 52% of the homes in the U.S. are greater than 40 years old. As you will recall, that the three-year sales target we established in 2017 started with a base comp of 4%. The sales forecasting model that we built for 2019 doesn't move us materially off that base. For 2019, we are planning a 5% comp, which includes our base model plus growth emanating from our strategic investments. For fiscal 2019, we expect total sales growth of approximately 3.3%, reflecting the compare to 52 weeks last year. Two more comments for your models, first, when you are thinking about the shape of the year, we would expect the comp for the first-half of 2019 to be about 250 basis points lower than the second-half of the year because of the hurricane-related sales overlap. On a two-year stack basis, we expect that our first-half and second-half comp will be relatively similar. Second, because of the shift in the year and the seasonality of our business, our 2019 comp sales will not match our sales growth rates in three or four quarter. During the year, we plan to open five net new stores, four in the U.S., and one in Mexico. For fiscal 2019, we are projecting our gross margin rate to be approximately 34%, in line with the 2020 target we set forth during our December 2017 investor conference. At this time, we are not expecting further gross margin contraction in fiscal 2020. We expect our fiscal 2019 operating expenses to grow at approximately 53% the rate of our sales growth. On a 52-to-52 week basis, and ignoring the impairment charge we reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect our fiscal 2019 operating expenses to grow at approximately 90% of the rate of our sales growth. For the year, we expect that our operating margin will be essentially flat with what we reported in fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, we estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%. We expect fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 3.1% to $10.03. Our earnings per share guidance include our plan to repurchase approximately $5 billion of outstanding shares during the year. For the year, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $14 billion. We will invest $2.7 billion of this cash back into the business in support of our strategic initiative. We also plan to use this cash to pay $6 billion of dividends. As Craig mentioned, we just announced a 32% increase in our quarterly dividend, which equates to an annual dividend of $5.44, in line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 55% of earning. Finally, we plan to repurchase $5 billion of outstanding shares using excess cash. At our last investor conference, in December, 2017, we shared with you our long-term financial target and our strategy to create the One Home Depot. By the end of fiscal 2020, we are aiming to grow our sales to a range of $115 billion to $120 billion, with an operating margin range of 14.4% to 15%, and return on invested capital of more than 40%. As evidenced by our fiscal 2018 results and our guidance for 2019, today, we are reaffirming out long-term targets. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is two parts, on gross margin. So, getting to the 34% level in 2019, was that always part of your plan and The Street maybe just looked like it was mismodeling or is something changing on your investment cadence? And then the second part of that gross margin question is, can you split the, it looks like about 30 basis points of contraction, into like fixed versus variable costs, and how much would gross margin [indiscernible] comps or better or worse than the 100 basis points of your forecast?\nCraig Menear: Simeon, I think the first comment I'd have is as it relates to the margin rate, was a difference in what we anticipated. A little bit more sustained pressure in supply chain maybe than what we initially anticipated in 2017.\nCarol Tome: But as we look at our model, both for '19 and '20, let me break apart the gross margin performance for you and our expectations. First, as you know, productivity is a virtuous cycle at The Home Depot. And we have productivity in our cost of goods. And we project productivity into '19 and '20. Offsetting the productivity in '19 is some pressure that Craig mentioned, in supply chain as well as our supply chain rollout. There's a little bit of shrink pressure in 2019, but we're going to cover that off with productivity. And then there's a mix pressure, mix that was always in our plan as we see relatively outperformance of growth in lower-margin category. So, as we look through '19 to '20, nothing comes to our attention that is at this point that the margin will contract further, because productivity will continue into '20. On your second part of your question, in terms of fixed variable nature of our gross margin or of our cost of goods, we actually don't look it through that lens. But I will tell you, within the performance in the fourth quarter, there were a few surprises relative to the guidance that we gave at the end of the third quarter. First, the supply chain contraction of 19 basis points was a bit higher than we had anticipated. We had three basis points of fuel pressure come through, and about five basis points of higher fees related to third-party delivery agents. And then we had a bit higher shrink than we anticipated. Hopefully that's helpful.\nSimeon Gutman: Yes, it's helpful. My follow-up is on the demand side. Can you tell us if there were any markets that were \"normal\", not meaning ex-weather, did they perform in line or did they perform better than you thought? And then you've told us in the past where housing turnover markets have been soft you've called out that the business has been solid, just checking if that's still the case.\nCarol Tome: Yes. We've got great performance in areas that had good weather. I must say the weather was across the country, but you can find pockets of relative outperformance. And if you look at the housing related markets, let's take Seattle as an example. Seattle is talked about a lot as the place where there's been huge home price appreciation. The comp is Seattle for the fourth quarter was at 6.3%. Let's take Dallas. Dallas is another area of the country where home prices have seen significant home price appreciation. The comp in Dallas was in line with the company average. So, we're not seeing any impact to our performance in a negative way because of the housing environment.\nCraig Menear: If you looked at a market like L.A., when the weather has shifted, we've seen 1,400 basis point swing week-to-week based on weather. So, when the weather was positive it would lift 1,400 basis points.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot of taking my question. You noted that your comp guidance is based on 4% growth from underlying economic conditions in housing. Is there a way that you could size the potential downside if GDP doesn't meet 2.6% and we see a continued deceleration in some of the key housing metrics?\nCarol Tome: Well, clearly, our base model starts with GDP and the forecast for GDP next year are - there's a wide range. We landed on 2.6%. We think that's the right number to you, we added to that about a point coming from the various housing metrics that we look at, so that takes our base comp to 3.6, and candidly, we rounded up to four because we are just not that good at it. There - we really wanted to call out two things that are important in our model and one is from equity. There's 15.4 billion through - what am I saying, $15.4 trillion of home equity out there. Home equity has more than doubled since 2011. And if you look at the home equity per owner occupied household, that equity is $193,000 and has not been extracted, so we think that bodes well, it's a wealth effect that bodes well into 2019. The other aspect of the housing market is just the age of the housing market, 52% of the home is older than 40 years. We know that spend for homes that are 40 years and older is 30% greater than spend on homes less than 10 year.\nMichael Lasser: An my follow-up question is on the contribution from your initiatives, shouldn't we expect that the contribution, which we said that a 100 basis points, should we expect that, that's going to build over the course of the year as you've had more time to benefit from what you've put in place over the last 12 month to 18 months and what's the upside risk from that those initiatives driving more than a 100 basis points contribution.\nCraig Menear: Michael, it will build as we go forward, you're thinking about that's the right way. And so, we definitely, we see it building throughout 2019 and then beyond.\nMichael Lasser: When\u2026\nCarol Tome: Michael, I mentioned that the back half comp would be greater than the first half comp, part of that is due to Hoover Hurricane overlap but part of it is due to build.\nMichael Lasser: And what leading indicators are you looking at within the business that gives you confidence that it's going to contribute 100 basis points as you are expected?\nCraig Menear: Well when we look at the initiatives that we've begun to put in place whether that is the amount of store refreshes that we have done, whether it is the interconnected experience with the automated lockers that we put in place, which is driving obviously a great response from the from the customers. These are things that we tested, we piloted and as we rolled, we begun to see benefit a test result and feel comfortable that those are going to be the driver behind that point of initiative growth.\nCarol Tome: We're also seeing outside growth in our pro-business and as we continue to add pro's to our Web site, our new pro experience, if you will, we're adding over a million customers this year. We see spend with those customers increasing.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Got you\u2026\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nScot Ciccarelli: So can you help us understand maybe the investment pace a little bit better? It sounds like there may be some shifts between the original expectations between 2019 and 2020, just from a timing perspective, number one. Number two, could we end up facing a scenario where the absolute investment amount knows what you're doing in the supply chain and in the stores et cetera. Maybe exceed your prior views and, almost every company out there, their investment plan seems to be moving target?\nCarol Tome: Well, I'm happy to take you back to December '17, when we laid out our investment plan. So you'll recall, we are announcing $1.1 billion investment plan, which was $5.4 billion over what we would have spent in a BAU basis. And this is the cash to look at the investment. So I suppose expense and capital. Then we shared with you a chart back in 2017 that broke that spending down by year, we said we would spend $1.4 billion in '18, $1.9 billion in '19 and $2.1 billion in '20. If we look at what we spent in '18, we spent $1.4 billion about $550 million in expense and $800 million in capital. Now on the expenses, we also had some depreciation but that wasn't on the chart that we shared with you. If you add the depreciation related to our investments in 2018, it was more like $700 million. As we look to '19, we are projecting in our guidance that we will spend $1.7 billion, $550 million and expense and about $1.1 billion in capital. That's roughly $200 million under what we shared with you in 2017, that spending is being pushed to '20, and it might push out a little past to '20. The reason for this is because we're just getting smarter about how we spend our dollars and I've had to change the prioritization of some of our activity to deal with some of our legacy IT system. As we look at it today, our estimate is we won't exceed our spend and that we may be able to deliver this under the target. So we've got to face this the appropriate way so that we don't actually deliver an initiative that the foundation can't serve. So hopefully that's helpful.\nCraig Menear: Yes, Scot.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Thanks.\nCraig Menear: This year was a learning year as related to the investments and we found that some things we could actually accelerate and other things we are going to take us a little bit longer as Kelly mentioned because of legacy systems that we have to fix.\nScot Ciccarelli: Understood. Okay, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Carol just on the macro again just trying to connect the dots between your 5% guide and leaders view for 2019 particularly its expectation on games and our renovation spending slows as the year progresses, which is sort of counter what - to what you're speaking to. And just also on a follow-up to the comp with the shift going from week one to 52 weeks to 253. I know for some of the department stores that tend to throw things off a lot. Is there anything that we should think about in terms of the quarterly cadence because of that?\nCarol Tome: Yes, so let me address the latter part of your question first, and then we'll get back to the macro. So the shift in the calendar wouldn't be such a big deal that we weren't such a seasonal business, but we were very seasonal business. So this year, let's take the first quarter, we will be comparing weeks one through 13 and 19 against weeks 2 through 14 and 18 and that shift will have an impact. So you would expect the comp in the first quarter to actually be lower than the actual sales growth that we report that reverses in the second quarter and the second quarter we would expect the comps to be higher than the sales growth we report and the third quarter it'll be about the same and then in the fourth quarter, the comp will be higher than the sales growth that we report aggressively, because we're up against 14 weeks versus 13 weeks that we will share. I will tell you that the first week difference is about $1.5 billion sales. So we're dropping off the compare on a $1.5 billion and we're gaining that compare of over $2 billion. So hopefully that helps you kind of model with that first quarter impactful Bay. Now going back to the macro questions, we can use this directionally correct. But in perfect model, and it's worked for us pretty well, since we implemented it. And if you've been following us for a while, you'll recall that we set forth stages of housing recovery and the impact it would have on our comps. And we have three stages of housing recovery. There was sharp, there was moderate, and then there was stability. And if you look through that document, I think it's on our Web site. If not, we can get it to you, you can see in the stability area, which is where we think we are trending our model suggest it's GDP plus one to two, we conservatively said GDP plus one. So if you use a 2.6% GDP and you add one basis, 100 basis points to that, you get to 3.6% and we rounded up a bit to 4% and then as you heard from Craig, we added a point relative to our strategic investments. There are lots of forces and economic prognosis that you can use. But one thing that we use to kind of support our point of view is what the Harvard Joint Center says for remodeling activity and their forecasts for remodeling activity in 2019 is a 5% growth.\nChuck Grom: Okay, great. Thanks very much. And then, one more if you Carol, on the third quarter call you gave some helpful color on tax refunds and the timing impact, just curious if your views on that front of change at all. And it looks like February refunds are down a lot, which is expected just wondering if that's impacted your business and thus far in February\nCarol Tome: Yes, now we wouldn't say that there's an impact to our business from tax in February and as you pointed out, we wouldn't expect the real benefits coming from tax reform to come in later. As those filers who haven't earned income credit or in a child credit, they actually haven't filed those returns get filed and processed later.\nChuck Grom: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nChristopher Horvers: So there's a lot of noise in '18; hurricane inflation in the first-half of the year, a touch in the fourth quarter of deflation, can you just - it'd be helpful to think about 2018. If we backed out whether on an annual basis and we backed out the net benefit from inflation in the first three quarters. What is that underlying rate and how does that compare to the 5% guide that you're putting out for 2019 and does that guide include any benefit from or headwind from inflation, deflation?\nCraig Menear: So we looked at that, we backed those noise levels out, it gets you somewhere in the area of a 55 to a 57 as a normalized run rate, you think about taking out the storms, you take out the weather, you take out the inflation. That's where we run into.\nCarol Tome: And as you know, when we build our plan, we are commodity inflation neutral. We don't really know how to plan for that. Based on where commodity prices are, let me give you a little bit of brush from - in the first-half of the year what we plan for that.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood, so just to summarize, there's who basically saying I mean precise based points but 70, 80 basis points of moderation and the underlying driven comp from '18 to '19, okay understood.\nCarol Tome: What you speculate in that - you would expect that where we are in the house and recovery, we'd expect that.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it and then in terms of the shift from pricing, well turnover net, then pricing and now Home Equity and age does that express itself in any way in terms of traffic versus ticket growth, do you expect ticket continue to lead as ticket growth actually become more of a factor versus the traffic growth. How are you thinking about that?\nCraig Menear: Yes, it would impact continue to support ticket growth for sure, and if you think about the formations, estimated to be increasing in 2019 while turnover is more flattish to where it was in 2018 that would definitely drive project business.\nChristopher Horvers: Okay. And then one quick - go ahead. Sorry, Ted.\nTed Decker: Yes, sorry, Chris. I would just add on the ticket. The thing that's really encouraging about ticket reasons we called out in an innovative product and more premium roofing and a grill like a Traeger grill. We look at a number of signals very closely. One is the line structure where sales are coming from OPP to good, better, best. We continue to see stronger productivity as you move up price points and we break that out. Second data point we look at very closely is where is ticket growth coming from? And we include commodity, we include tariffs, we include new items, et cetera. And by far our largest ticket growth is coming from the introduction of new innovative items. It's actually much more significant than either inflation or tariff.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then, and just to sneak one, last one in and Carol anything - any particular cadence around gross margin in SG&A versus sales growth. Obviously the fourth quarter, you allow the extra week, but anything else to call out on a quarterly basis and margins?\nCarol Tome: Yes, [indiscernible]. And we try to predict when spring will break. And we use five-year historical averages and forecasts from Planalytics, and we tried to predict when it will break, we are usually wrong, but we try. Now based on the way that we built our plan, we think that spring is going to break, it hasn't yet, but we think that spring is going to break in the first quarter. So because many of our seasonal categories are lower margin, you would expect the margin decline to be the greatest in the first quarter. So that's an important thing to get out there as you're building your models, because as you know, we're not really good at this. But that's what our model - that's how we're planning. Then from an expense growth factor, the real noise will be I guess in the fourth quarter, but I think, we've given you enough color there that you can model to that. So there's really nothing too [goopy] on the expense side.\nChristopher Horvers: Have a great spring. Thanks very much.\nCarol Tome: Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Forbes: Good morning.\nCarol Tome: Good morning.\nSteve Forbes: I wanted to focus on the enhanced delivery and fulfillment option rollout that you mentioned for 2019. So maybe you just comment on the number and type of facility slated to open in '19 and I guess, how you're moving along relative to the original plan?\nCraig Menear: Yes, Steve, we're excited about the pilots that we\u2019ve put in place in 2018 and the learning that we have and Mark is here I'll let him address that, but I would also say that we're excited about the options that we provided for our customers during the year as well on same day delivery for a car and van service on products out of our stores.\nCarol Tome: Yes, just a reminder, we have our five direct fulfillment centers already up providing one and two-day service to over 90% of the population. We've got our Interline Brands facilities. Now Home Depot pro that give us near national coverage with next day delivery via 700 private fleet trucks. We've opened three market delivery operations and we have openings planned and groundbreaking planned through the year on the various new platforms, market delivery operations, flatbed delivery centers, et cetera. So we're looking forward to that and of course we have our car delivery and van delivery fast options there with 40% coverage of the U.S. population for low cost car delivery and 70% with van coverage.\nSteve Forbes: And then, just a quick follow-up, maybe more of a modeling question, right, as it relates to DNA specifically, can you - because I think, if you walk back to the Analyst Day in '17, there was a - I guess an average three-year DNA run rate, right? That was called out. Can you just update us on how that - which we should be building in as we lookout to 2020?\nCarol Tome: So I think in our guidance, we gave you a DNA number of what did we say $2.3 billion, some of that flows through cost of goods sold. So on the expense line, you could plan about $2 billion of DNA on the expense line, and the remaining $300 million would be up in the cost of goods sold.\nSteve Forbes: And then, any comments that we look at the 2020 relative to the three-year plan you laid out during the Analyst Day for DNA.\nCarol Tome: I just keep it about that rate.\nSteve Forbes: Thank you very much.\nCarol Tome: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. You talked about some of the dynamics around the transition to the spring selling season with the later spring last year, is there anything that gives you confidence this year from either a whether to-date or product perspective, and can you just given the calendar ticket -- you gave some helpful color. But here is whether you anticipate the Q1 comp to be above or below the full-year comp growth just given the full start\u2026\nTed Decker: I mean, I will start with what Carol said earlier, and that is, we do use a multi-year average model in terms of planning. And when you look at that model, it suggests that we will actually see spring break in Q1.\nCarol Tome: We don't provide quarterly guidance as you know. So I'd like to go back to the half. That's the easiest way to think about our business, I would expect the first half comp to be lower than the full-year comp.\nZach Fadem: Okay, fair enough. And could you comment on how some of the external factors in '19 like lower gas prices in mortgage rates for the consumer are incorporated in the '19 outlook? And then second, what do you assume in around the tariff environment?\nTed Decker: We for years have tried to correlate gas prices to our business. We've never been able to draw a correlation on that. And so, we've - there's nothing built in for that whatsoever and then you've assumed nothing beyond what is in place today on tariffs. We just feel we don't try to plan for something that hasn't happened. As we've said with tariffs that's been manageable good news obviously Sunday and looks like negotiations are continuing but all the tariffs that have been put in place today, we have managed through that without any issue.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question today will come from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Sigman: Thanks. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So regarding the weather impact and the impact on exterior projects, you gave us the 85-basis point impact. I'm curious during these types of periods, do you actually see an offsetting benefit on indoor projects and then just narrowing in on the exterior projects. To what extent you already trying to see those comeback or expect to see those comeback in that first-half outlook. Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Yes, I mean, generally, as Ted mentioned, we felt very positive about our paint business and so customers have a tendency to focus inside when they can't do work outside and that is something that happens in the business overall. So we felt good about the interior side of the business.\nTed Decker: Yes, I would say every cycle, we have had a bad weather. You know, Craig mentioned the huge swings in a market like Los Angeles. We've seen that consistently across all our markets. Last spring, for example, we were delayed and as soon as the weather broke and our business just\u2026\nCarol Tome: Not bad.\nTed Decker: Just exploded, and we see that across markets now, weekend-to-weekend, so full expectation that when spring comes, we're ready for it. We got great innovative products. We are in stock and ready to go for our customers.\nCarol Tome: Okay.\nSeth Sigman: Got you. Okay. And then, just one follow-up on the pricing environment, you talked a lot about commodity prices. Can you just talk a little bit about price changes that you're seeing in non-commodity categories, and if you're embedding anything in the guidance? Thanks.\nTed Decker: There's nothing in the guidance for sure. Right, across the board, not just with tariffs but we've seen through '18 and increased cost expectation from our suppliers, just whether it's wages or transportation, supply chain, fuel things that they've experienced. But we've digested all of that, and run that across the portfolio basis. So we don't see any increased pressure going into '19, if anything, as you mentioned, things like fuel and transportation capacity, and hopefully the tariff outlook, all those pressures should be abating a bit.\nIsabel Janci: So thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in May.\nOperator: This will conclude today's call.

Now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning everyone. We're pleased with our results in the quarter. Sales for the third quarter were up 5.1% from last year to 26.3 billion. Comp sales were up 4.8% from last year and our U.S. comps were positive 5.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.51 in the third quarter. From a geographic perspective sales were strong across the U.S. All but one of our 19 regions posted positive comps. The exception was our Gulf region, which faced tough compares associated with the anniversary of Hurricane Harvey. Recall that we're lapping almost 300 million of Hurricane related sales from the third quarter of last year. While this quarter brought Hurricanes Florence and Michael, the scope of devastation was more compact from a geographical perspective than what we experienced in prior year. Nonetheless, these storms did inflict significant damage in our community and thoughts and prayers are with them as they begin the recovery efforts. Our thoughts and prayers also go out to all those who are currently being impacted by the deadly fires in California. Internationally, both Canada and Mexico posted positive comps in local currency. As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. Pro sales once again outpaced DIY sales, but we continue to see a healthy balance in growth from both Pro and DIY customers as they shop across the store. We believe this is a testament to the overall strength of demand in the home improvement market. Our digital business continues to be another source of growth. Online traffic growth was healthy. In third quarter, online sales grew approximately 28% from the third quarter of 2017. Customers continued to respond to ongoing investments and enhancements we're making to drive a frictionless interconnected customer experience. For example, buy online ship to store and buy online pickup in store sales, both grew faster than the overall online sales growth rate for the third quarter. Another key component of the best in class interconnected shopping experience centers on enhanced delivery and fulfillment options. As you know, we're in very early stages of a five year investment journey in the One Home Depot supply chain to enable the fastest, most efficient delivery network in home improvement. Today, we can reach approximately 95% of the U.S. population in two days or less with parcel shipping. The anticipated end state of the One Home Depot Supply Chain will enable us to reach 90% of the U.S. population with same day or next day delivery capability for an extended SKU offering that includes big and bulky goods. In order to get there, we must invest in a number of different facilities to offer greater depth and breadth of SKU availability. We told you that 2018 will be the year of the pilot as we test and learn with new fulfillment centers. I'm pleased to report that we're on track with our plan and we are live with our first few pilot facilities, with additional pilots scheduled to open throughout the rest of this year and early next year. As we work on our long-term initiatives, we're also focused on meeting our customers' immediate delivery needs. We've made great progress with our store delivery enhancements as our car and van express delivery offerings now enables same day delivery of store goods. Since rolling out car and van delivery to over 40% of the U.S. population we have seen increased utilization from both our Pro and DIY customers. As we continue to work towards the 2020 goals that we laid out for you in December of 2017, let me update you on some of our investments all of which focus on delivering exceptional customer service, driving productivity and simplifying operations. We've implemented our wayfinding sign and store refresh package in approximately 700 stores ahead of our initial plan. We continue to make progress on the rollout of our redesigned front-end areas and pickup lockers among other investments. We're also working to remove friction for our customers while helping our associates to be more productive with their time. An example of this is the deployment of our new overhead management application. As you've heard say before, customer service starts with being in stock, but beyond just having the product in stock, it has to be on the shelf for our customers to purchase, not stored in an overhead. Prior to the rollout of the overhead management application, the only way an associate could locate product in our overheads was to manually look for it. This new application on first stones helps associates locate product in overheads quickly and accurately saving them time, improving the customer experience and enabling better inventory management. Turning to our outlook, as Carol will discuss some more detail, we're updating our sales and earnings guidance for the year. We now expect fiscal 2018 sales growth of approximately 7.2% and diluted earnings per share of $9.75. We faced the headwinds from last year's storm related sales in the fourth quarter, but we believe the drivers of home improvement spend are supportive of our business. We remain excited about the investments we're making to ensure that we deliver the best customer experience in home improvement. I want to close by thanking our associated for their hard work and continued dedication to our customers. Our associates not only record to serve our customers and our aisles, but their efforts extend to the communities in which we operate. This quarter marked our eighth annual Celebration of Service campaign in which our associates volunteered over a 100,000 hours in support of veteran housing needs. In fact, our associates and non-profit partners have been hands on in transforming over 40,000 veteran homes and facilities since 011. We're very proud of our associates to live our values every day. And given that Veterans Day was earlier this week, let me take this opportunity to thank those that have served our country. And with that let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig and good morning everyone. We were pleased with our results in the third quarter. The core of our store continues to perform well and we saw growth, with both our Pro and DIY customers. Looking at our departments, comps in appliances, electrical, plumbing, tools, d\u00e9cor and flooring were above the company average. All of our other departments but lighting were positive but below the company average. The comp in lighting was essentially flat. In the third quarter, comp average ticket increased 3.5% and comp transactions increased 1.2%. Commodity prices were volatile in the quarter, while inflation in lumber, building materials and copper positively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 61 basis points in the quarter. Today lumber prices are below 2017 levels. In addition foreign exchange rates negatively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 43 basis points. We continue to see strength in big ticket projects during the quarter. Big ticket sales or transactions over $1,000, which represent approximately 20% of US sales were up 9.1% in the third quarter. A few drivers behind the increase in big ticket sales were vinyl plank flooring, windows, appliances and water heaters. Once again we saw strong performance in many Pro heavy categories as pro sales grew faster than the company's average comp. Pro heavy categories like power tools, concrete and several plumbing and electrical categories all had comps above the company average. We also continue to see a healthy and growing DIY customer as they engage with us across the store. Categories like safety and security, vanity, lawnmowers, ceiling fans and interior and exterior paint showed strong growth in the quarter. In the third quarter we hosted several events that helped drive traffic and create excitement in our stores. We were pleased with our annual Halloween, Harvest and Labor Day events, which recorded solid growth year-over-year. As we continue to focus on enhancing the in store experience for our customers, I'd like to highlight some recent initiatives we've been working on with MET our Merchandising Execution Team. This season team managers set integrity and execute three sets throughout the stores, bringing best in class speed to market. MET leverages advanced analytics and proprietary technology to drive productivity and efficiency in our stores. We use real time data to understand what categories require attention and leverage our first phones to direct the work activity of our MET associates. We wanted to thank our supplier partners who continue to see the power of partnering with the Home Depot. Our suppliers trust us with many exclusives and innovative product launches in large part because of our 400,000 plus blooded associates and the enthusiasm they bring to our aisles every day. Two recent additions to our portfolio of exclusive brands are Stanley, Hand Tools and Troy-Bilt, Outdoor Power Equipment. Adding Stanley to our lineup of Milwaukee, DEWALT, Husky, Crescent, Empire, Wiss, BESSEY and Klein exclusive brands, makes us the number one destination for hand tools. And Troy-Bilt complements our leading lineup of exclusive Outdoor Power Equipment brands including Ryobi, Toro, Honda, Cub Cadet, ECHO, EGO, DEWALT and Milwaukee. In fact, 14 of the 15 top rated gas self-propelled lawnmowers in the market are big fox exclusives to the Home Depot. Looking to the fourth quarter, we're excited about the upcoming holiday season. In addition to our comprehensive holiday d\u00e9cor offerings, we're thrilled with our 2018 gift center. This gift center is our best yet and features a number of special buys from our leading tool and power tool accessory brands that are also exclusive to the Home Depot including Ryobi, RIDGID, Milwaukee, Makita, Diablo and Husky. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Ted, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, total sales were $26.3 billion, an increase of 5.1% from last year. Recall that at the beginning of fiscal 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard pertaining to revenue recognition. The new standard changes the geography of certain items on our income statement but has no impact on operating profit. In the third quarter, the change in accounting positively impacted sales growth by $64 million. Further, during the third quarter a stronger US dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $110 million or 0.4%. Our total company comps were positive 4.8% for the quarter with positive comps of 6.7% in August, 74.1% in September and 3.8% in October. Comps in the US were positive 5.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 7.5% in August, 4.7% in September, and 4.2% in October. The cadence of our monthly comps in due in large part to Hurricane related sales. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we experienced approximately $282 million of Hurricane related sales and the majority of those sales occurred in September and October. In the third quarter of this year, we had approximately $150 million of sales related to both the 2017 and 2018 Hurricanes. These sales were more equally spread across the quarter. We estimate that Hurricane related sales positively impacted US comps by 60 basis points in August, but negatively impacted US comps by 80 basis points in September and 120 basis points in October. In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.8%, an increase of 23 basis points from last year. The year-over-year change in our gross margin reflects the following factors. First, the new accounting standard drove about $147 million of gross profit or 47 basis points of gross margin expansion. Second, higher supply chain and transportation costs caused approximately 23 basis points of gross margin contraction. And finally the net impact of all other drivers of gross margin resulted in 1 basis point of contraction. For the year, we now expect our gross margin rate to expand by approximately 37 basis points. In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased by 23 basis points to 20.1% due to the following factors. First, we experienced 90 basis points of expense leverage in BAU, or Business As Usual expense. Our strong leverage in the core of our business was driven by good expense control, but also reflects some year-over-year benefit due to certain Hurricane related expenses that did not repeat this year. Second, the new accounting standard resulted in $147 million increase to our operating expenses and caused 51 basis points of operating expense deleverage. And finally, expenses related to our strategic investment plan of roughly $164 million resulted in approximately 62 basis points of operating expense deleverage. For the year we now expect our fiscal 2018 operating expenses to grow at approximately 131% of our sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the third quarter was 14.7%, essentially flat with last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter decreased by $23 million to $224 million, largely due to tax settlements that occurred in the quarter. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 21.4% and for the year-to-date was 23.3%, lower than last year and our guidance. The lower rate reflects tax reform and a few other discreet items that were recorded in the quarter, including a reconcilement of the provisional tax charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. For fiscal 2018, we now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 24%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $2.51, an increase of 36.4% from last year. Total sales per square foot for the third quarter were approximately $434, up 5.2% from last year. Compared to last year, inventory dollars grew by $1.3 billion to $14.8 billion and inventory turns remained at 5.2 times. The growth in our inventory versus last year reflects the investments we're making to accelerate merchandising expense [ph], higher in stock levels than we had one year ago and some pull forward of planned inventory purchases. In the third quarter, we repurchased $2.5 billion or approximately 12.6 million shares of outstanding stock. We also received approximately 1 million shares related to an ASR program we initiated in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $5.5 billion of our outstanding shares, and we now expect to repurchase approximately $8 billion of our outstanding shares for the year. We plan to fund our fourth quarter share repurchases with cash on hand and with proceeds from incremental debts. In the fourth quarter we intend to replace $1.15 billion of senior notes that came due in September and we may raise additional long-term indebtedness, which will take us closer to our targeted adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 2 times. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 42.2%, 970 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, remember that we have a directionally correct but imperfect model that we use to forecast sales growth. It starts with GDP growth, which is strong, consumer sentiment remains near all-time highs and unemployment is the lowest it has been in nearly 50 years. Housing related metrics are moderating, but the drivers of home improvement spend are supportive of our outlook. Home prices continue to appreciate, the housing stock is ageing, households are being formed and housing continues to turn over. And while we see healthy home improvement demand, it is important to note that in the fourth quarter we are up against approximately $380 million of Hurricane related sales. Today, we're updating our fiscal 2018 sales guidance to reflect our year-to-date outperformance. We're also lifting our earnings per share guidance to reflect our expectations for fiscal 2018 gross margin, operating expense, share repurchases and tax rate. Remember that we guide off GAAP and recall that fiscal 2018 will include a 53rd week, so the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 will consist of 14 weeks. For fiscal 2018, we expect sales to increase by approximately 7.2% with positive comps as calculated on a 52-week basis of approximately 5.5%. For earnings per share, we expect fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 33.8% to $9.75. With that, I would like to thank you for your participation in today's call. And Porsha, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question today will come from Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks, good morning. So if you - yeah, there's a lot of questions on the consumer in the home environment and housing. If you look at your fourth quarter guidance, it seems like inflation after some benefit in the third quarter maybe flat, maybe a headwind, you also had a - have a harder comparing the Hurricane front, so you're still guiding to about 4.5 for the fourth quarter assuming that the US is going to be better than that of FX. So what are you seeing in the business, what gives you the confidence to give that level of a guide?\nCraig Menear: Chris, I'll give you a high level and let Carol walk you through the details. Again, we see overall the environment for home improvement is solid. We're clearly up against significant Hurricane numbers, but as we see it basically two years stat comps would be comparable in the first half and the second half of the year as we look forward and that's really based on the strength that we see for not only the home improvement factors, but what we've lined up for the back half of the year in terms of the events and merchandise and great gift center that Ted talked about. We're excited about where we're going in the back half.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: That's right, Chris. And we get comfort from our guidance not only from what we're seeing in the macro environment, but from what we're seeing in our - in sales and we're pleased with how the quarter has begun.\nChristopher Horvers: Excellent, so wanted to fast forward a little bit on tariff risk, you had the experience of appliances that look like you marginally pass through those price increases, but as you think about a more broad potential tariff to next year, how would you just size up your potential risk and can you also talk about how you think about investment in sort of - in share? Some companies have commented that they would try to maintain the gross margin rate, how would you think about balancing gross margin rate versus let's say in certain categories maybe flooring trying to go after share and drive gross profit dollars.\nCraig Menear: So Chris, I'll start and let Ted jump in here. Yeah, we've seen as you mentioned a tariffs impact in laundry for example. The tariffs that have come through to date represent 1% of US purchases and we see more happen in January and who knows what's going to happen. But if the 25% were to go in place that's going to represent about 3.5% of US purchases. And clearly we'll work to mitigate as much of that as possible, but as you saw in laundry you will see some impact in prices. The comment that I would make as it relates to the second part of your question is, we run this business on a portfolio basis and we will do everything we can to mitigate the pressure on the customer to the best of our ability. But don't think of us taking costs in one area and that's where necessarily retail gets applied, it's portfolio approach, we're in a project business.\nTed Decker: Yeah, I would add to that Craig, its manageable is the term I'm using Chris. Certainly of what we've seen today is more than manageable particularly in the light of that portfolio approach that Craig described. But a couple of comments, good news, if you look at what happened with laundry and that's generally a mad priced industry, so the industry did take that price largely attributable to tariffs, we also had stilt cost in that as well, it's just the straight laundry tariff. And while there was an initial reaction to unit productivity is we've right now cycled through that several months our laundry sales and unit productivity is on par if not slightly better than the average of our overall appliance business. So we were able to cycle through that and would expect to see the same again given the strength of demand in other categories as well.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks, everybody.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: And next we'll move on to Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So it sounds like your view is that home improvement demand has been and will be decoupled from housing. How long do you think that can persist and what level of home prices and housing turnover would make you rethink that view?\nCarol Tome: Michael, I think I'd - and we would phrase that a bit differently. We have this directionally correct but imperfect model that we use to forecast ourselves outlook. As I mentioned, it starts with GDP, and to that we add the benefits from a number of different housing metrics including household formation, home price appreciation, the age of the housing stock and housing turnover. And if we look at those drivers, we think they all bode well for our outlook, now our outlook would suggest that our fourth quarter comps will be lower than what we reported in the third quarter, but that's because we are up against almost $400 million of hurricane related sales. And while we do expect to get hurricane related sales in the fourth quarter, we don't expect to get $400 million worth of hurricane related sales, so we factor that into our outlook. In terms of decoupling, there's one metric that's gotten a lot of attention recently and that's housing turnover. And if you look at housing turnover, housing turnover is lower than we thought it would be at the beginning of the year when we put together our directionally correct but imperfect model. So we went back and calculated what we believe the impact of a lower housing turnover than what we had projected at the beginning of the year, what the impact has been to our outlook, and based on our model which is not perfect, but based on our model, the impact has been 13 basis points. And then one other correlation number to share with you, at least, through the way that we look at the world, we correlated housing turnover with transactions and we don't do a smoothing approach, we do look at the actual data on a one-month lag basis. If you look at historical correlation from 2000 to now, the correlation coefficient was 0.53. Okay. But if you go and run it again from 2010 to now, it's 0.4, and if you run it from 2015 to now, it's 0.33. So it's decoupled a bit, we think in large part because of the housing shortage in the US. The way that we're talking about housing metrics, it's a bit like a Rubik's Cube, you just got to turn it and turn it and turn it until you form a point of view on what it means for home improvements band.\nMichael Lasser: And, Carol, that's helpful, and - because you've guided for the next few years that comps will grow in the 5%-ish range. So should we think about if housing turnover continues to decline at a similar rate and home prices start to moderate, you know, that the risk to that forecast would be in this 13 basis point type range or would not be as significant as what would be implied by the headlines from those port - from that outlook?\nCarol Tome: Again it's a Rubik's Cube, you can't just look at turnover when you're turning the cube around. We would need to refresh our point of view on home price appreciation as well because that's been a big driver of our sales growth for sure. We've seen since 2011, homeowners have had a 140% increase in their equity, now up to $124,000 per unit, so real wealth has been created. Home prices are projected to increase in 2019, albeit not at the rate that we've seen this year, so we're refreshing our point of view, we're not taking ourselves from targets down because we feel very comfortable with the targets that we laid out a year ago, but in February, we will give you the specific number for 2019.\nMichael Lasser: And my follow-up question is there's been a lot of well documented pressure on your many of the home improvement vendors and you have been vocal about seeing an increase in the requests for price increases for those that sell products in to you. So putting aside their commodity inflation, are you starting to see an increase in product price inflation associated with the 90% of your sales that are related to products and you expect that that's going to continue to increase from here?\nCraig Menear: We're certainly seeing, we are still seeing cost out but we are seeing a net cost in that we haven't experienced in the last several years and we are seeing an increase in supplier requests for cost in. But again, I'd say, they're facing some of the same costs that Carol called out, I mean, people are facing transportation costs that's what we hear universally, again, outside, as you said, commodity or tariff, things like transportation is universal and who knows what happens going into '19, but that seems to be the theme for the cost requests for '18.\nMichael Lasser: Okay, just a follow-up on that. Since you quantify the impact the commodity inflation provides your ticket, could you quantify the impact that non-commodity inflation provides your ticket?\nCraig Menear: What we've seen to date it's less than ticket than the 60 - the commodity that we called out the 61 basis points.\nCarol Tome: It's less than that.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And next we'll move to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions So, I think, I want to follow up a bit at the risk of beating a dead horse here. On the macro environment, follow up to Michael's question. So, Carol, when you talk about your algorithm, which the detail you gave surprised, very helpful, thank you. Particularly with regard to the housing turnover metrics, it sounds to me like you're talking more from acquaintance standpoint, how you're - how - shifts in these metrics impact sales at Home Depot and was in real time? Have you done any work around or any insights into how the kind of a lead lag relationship, so if we are seeing the somewhat slower housing turn data now, who knows that's going to persist or not, but could that lead - could that have a larger impact upon sales that you're at Home Depot at some point in the future?\nCarol Tome: Well, the correlation coefficients that I shared with you on turnover were based on a one-month lag, and we haven't done a lot of leading lagging work yet, because the environment is so very different than it's been in prior cycles. So there's a lot of conversation, for example, on affordability, and we look at affordability too. But what happened last time around when affordability started to if you will slow down is the underwriting standards loosened up dramatically and that's what led to the housing prices as we all know. Well, that's not going to happen again, because of Dr. Ike. And so you can't look at history necessarily to understand what's going to happen in the future, you've got to kind of look at the future and what's happening. And as we look at the future and what's happening, fundamentally, you got to look at the economy and the economy is good. People are employed, they have more income, they've got more to come with tax reform, so fundamentally, we feel very good about just the two eyebrows of the spend in our business.\nBrian Nagel: Got it and then a follow-up question, there's been a lot written about, talked about, certain markets within the United States where you've seen pronounced weakness in home sales, as a result of either supply issues or housing prices whatever. And I think you've discussed this on prior calls, but if you look at your business, whether there's areas or, you know, in the North East, West Coast wherever, are you seeing any - in those type of markets, are you seeing any impact upon Home Depot sales?\nCarol Tome: So we believe like you that housing is very local and when you get into the areas of home price appreciation and affordability, it's really local. So we went market by market to see are we seeing any measurable impact on ourselves and we just can't see it. Now, we're hopefully smart enough to understand that you got to stay really on top of the data, because the one watch out of course is will affordability with rising home prices and rising interest rates at some point set a market clearing price for all home price appreciation and home price appreciation stall, we're not there. And, in fact, home prices are projected to increase next year, but we're watching this. I'll just give you one example without giving you the numbers, because we don't want to get into a habit of calling out performance by market, but if you look at LA, the affordability index in LA is terrible, it's 59, it's the worst it's been since 2008, and ourselves and LA are very good.\nBrian Nagel: Helpful as always. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll next move on to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Hey, thanks a lot. Good morning. Just again on the housing front, Realogy spoke last week about a pretty significant slowdown and October transaction is down 6%, and it looks like your October comps were 11.2% on the stack adjusted for the hurricane, say, up 12.4% still a little bit of a slowdown year-to-date, just when you look at the month of October, is there anything significant from a volatility where the customer is buying or how they're buying?\nCraig Menear: Well, overall, I mean, again, when you think about what happened in last year's hurricane, as Carol called out, there was more hurricane pressure that we faced in October than in September and clearly September and October combined were much more significant from a pressure standpoint than the beginning of the quarter.\nCarol Tome: And even if you ignore hurricanes, there wasn't anything dramatically different in the business other than the volatility in commodity prices. At the end of the quarter, we saw lumber prices fall precipitously, but I think, Ted, that actually was in some ways - it's a good news.\nTed Decker: No, that's very good news. So, if you look at some of the cost pressures we're seeing on the one hand with certain commodities and tariffs, we've seen a dramatic decrease in wood fiber costs, so we went down. At one point of the year, we were 40% above the prior year; we're now 24%-ish below prior year. And as those lumber prices have come down, unit productivity has moved dramatically and we believe kick starting more project business which is obviously great for us.\nCarol Tome: And one reason why we really are concerned about the fourth quarter from a commodity perspective is because we see this unit productivity.\nChuck Grom: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just to switch gears in inventory levels relative to sales that widened a bit more than the past couple of quarters, curious if that was intentional as maybe look to bring in some items ahead of the tariffs or was a spillover from October? Maybe just frame out how you feel about currency and where you think you will end the year on the inventory front?\nCraig Menear: From an inventory standpoint, Marc [indiscernible]. We feel good about the overall quality of the inventory that we had and the growth in inventory is really by design given a few factors.\nMarc Brown: Yeah. We continue to expect to see inventory productivity here at the Home Depot, but customer service begins with in-stock, so we really focus mostly on our in-stock. We have implemented tiered replenishment strategies that really provide focused investments to drive sales and in-stock where it matters the most. And the results we're seeing from that are really very good. We've actually reduced the number of out of stocks per store by 24% in our top selling SKUs and folks bringing that to life with the new in-store processes, we feel great about our shelf availability there. On top of that we've improved our direct fulfillment center in-stocks and service levels to the customers and setting new records in terms of in-stock there. So pleased with our in-stock levels and the investments we've made there.\nCraig Menear: The other part of that is our merchandising resets and obviously we've invested in that as well and then to your point, we did call some plant purchases forward to give ahead in terms of tariffs.\nChuck Grom: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And next we'll move to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning. If we add back some of the hurricane impacts that you called out, you get to somewhere in the 5% to 6% range and I'm keeping inflation in there for now. I just want to know is that number consistent with markets that have not been affected by any weather that year-over-year there's no benefit or compare - or tailwind - I'm sorry headwind. And then anything changing with consumers and opening price points opting for something lower taken anything on the consumer side that that shows any cracks?\nCarol Tome: We always look at the spread of performance by our 19 US region, and if you throw out the high and the low because those are hurricane related, one was negative and one was double digit positive, if you throw out the high and the low, the spread was the narrowest, it's been a long time it was 6.8%.\nCraig Menear: And in on the product purchase we continue to see both pro and consumers trading up with all the innovation the great products and brands we're offering in the stores, so that was extremely healthy in that progression of comp as you go up price points, in fact, if you'd look at our increase in ticket the 3.5%, the vast majority of that is driven by mix in innovation.\nSimeon Gutman: Right, okay, my follow-up, just two quick parts, the inventory, I guess you had extra inventory, can you tell us what categories you're investing deeper in? And then just a point of clarification, this may have been mentioned in the prepared remarks, the Q4 EBIT looks a little bit below the street, is that freight cost continuing or is there some shift of expenses that go from third quarter into fourth?\nCarol Tome: So, I answer that first. Based on the guidance that we've given you, the expense growth factor in Q4 should be lower than what we reported in Q3. And the gross margin expansion should be higher, that's a bit because of the 53rd week, so maybe there's some issue with the 53 week modeling, I don't know, but we can certainly offline help you with your models.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay and the inventory?\nCraig Menear: As far as the inventory categories, we're not going to give specific about where we invested for a couple of reasons [ph].\nSimeon Gutman: No worry. Thank you.\nOperator: And Matt McClintock with Barclays, we'll have our next question.\nMatt McClintock: Hi, yes, good morning, everyone. I'd actually like to ask two questions, the first one is on car and van delivery increased utilization for both Pro and DIY. Are you seeing outsized gains in either Pro or DIY relative to the other as you roll this out and build awareness?\nTed Decker: Car and van, we're pleased with the rollout there, as Greg mentioned, we're up to 41% of the population with car and van available, so very pleased with that rollout. The car - as the trucks get bigger, the Pros get more engaged. So if you think about it, our big flatbed deliveries that's very Pro focused; as you work your way down to car, that's more and more consumer focused. We're pleased to have that option out there for all our customers, though it's an important part of the portfolio of delivery options and we think those options are important across the range to meet our customer's needs in any given occasion.\nMatt McClintock: Thanks. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, just on home d\u00e9cor, I've seen the catalog this year, is there any - are you leaning into that category in any way different than what you did last year, is there any build there or is it more of the same?\nCraig Menear: As we outlined in our investor conference at the end of last year, we said we were going to lean in to home decor and we've been doing that with the catalog and in online, this is an online and direct play for us and we're seeing nice results, the customers engaging with The Home Depot in the home related decor categories and we'll continue that through the next year, certainly.\nMatt McClintock: Can I just - on the back end of that is, is there anything specific to the holiday that you think about with that category relative to the rest of the year?\nCraig Menear: No. I mean, we do our holiday decor set in the stores, obviously, that continues to be an incredibly strong business, in fact, it's the success in that business that gave us confidence that that we could move a little more decor oriented, not product we want to bring into the store but perfectly appropriate to engage the customer online.\nMatt McClintock: Perfect. Thank you very much\nOperator: And we'll move on to Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.\nSteve Forbes: Good morning. I wanted to start with the expense growth factor if you can. Can you help us break down the components in the third quarter? I think counting strategic investments business as usual. And then as part of that, maybe just update us what your thoughts on the appropriate business as usual run rate given the year-to-date performance, is it still that 90%, that 4.5% comp and 75 at 6, it looks like you did a little better than that year-to-date.\nCarol Tome: Well, I think what I'll do for you is break down the components for the full year, because I've given you the dollars for the quarter and you can do the math. We're guiding on expense growth forecast of 131% for the full year, the breakdown of that is BAU is 42%, invest is 51% and the change in accounting is 38%. And then in terms of the longer term view of our guidance, nothing has materially changed.\nSteve Forbes: And then just a quick follow-up, given the build out plans within the supply chain, maybe just update us with your views around your hiring and retaining employees given the competitive workforce dynamic and obviously your initiatives on that front. Are you having trouble or are you still finding the availability of employees to meet that upcoming need - the future need?\nCraig Menear: Yeah, we were able to hire over 80,000 associates for spring selling season this year. Candidly, we had a little concern as to whether or not it would be more challenging, but we really didn't find that to be the case. And Mark, I don't think you've seen anything different right now on supply chain end.\nMark Holifield: No, it's been pretty much the same there, we've had no real issues there.\nSteve Forbes: Thank you.\nCraig Menear: You bet.\nOperator: And we'll move on to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.\nSeth Sigman: Thanks. Hey, guys. A couple follow-up questions, just to go back to housing, as you mentioned, the consumer is obviously very healthy right now, on the housing front there's a lot of talk about just the lack of urgency as it relates to turnover, not actual demand but there's a lack of urgency, and I realize turnover on its own is a small part of the business. But I'm curious from a behavior perspective are you seeing any signs that the consumer is maybe taking more of a wait and see approach as it relates to bigger projects similar to how they're approaching purchasing the home?\nCarol Tome: We're not seeing that. And Ted called out the strength in our big ticket categories which grew more than 9% in the quarter. One hypothesis is that with rising interest rates consumers are intended to stay in their home and they have wealth in their homes and their home is aging and so they're spending money on their home. Another thing I would like to say about the consumer because we've done a lot of work in this regard and just thought we'd share it, because there was some interest about what is the impact of tax reform really meet on consumer's wallets. And I think we all know that tax reform is really good for consumers, it's projected that $1.1 trillion will flow to consumer's tax filers over the next 10 years. The way that's playing out in 2018 is about 43% of that benefit is flowing into paychecks today, the remaining 57% of the benefits will be realized when filers actually file their tax return next year, the other claim credits and that's how they get their benefits. The only way they could receive that benefit today is if they have adjusted their withholding. So we looked at 300,000 Home Depot associates to see whether or not they had adjusted their withholding, and only 3,000 of those associates had adjusted their withholdings. So we believe that many consumers are going to have a nice tax surprise next year. Now, if you are a high earner in a high state and local tax state like California or New York or Connecticut, well, that won't be the case, but high earners are actually those with $500,000 or more. Those folks, well, they're going to have a bit of a tax bill and that they haven't prepared for it is going to be a negative surprise. But we went to our consumer insights team and said, hey, what's the average income of our customers? 97% of our customer's average income is less than $250,000. So we think the health of the consumer continues into 2019.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Thanks Carol for that color. I appreciate it\nOperator: And we'll move on to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli, so are there any markets or even product categories where you're starting to see some trade down activity and related to that how do you think that would play out in a rising price environment because of tariffs and maybe you grant some of the price increase request that you're getting from your vendors?\nCraig Menear: So I'll start with a comment and turn it to Ted. Even in the downturn of 2008, which was obviously the most difficult since the depression,customers were willing to spend for new innovative product.\nTed Decker: Yeah. Ted, this is Scott. We haven't seen it yet and something I'm looking at, very closely we're looking at unit productivity by opening price point good, better, best, premium. Making sure we're priced right at the opening price point level and making sure inventory levels are ready to go to see if we're going to see that dynamic that you just referenced and we have not seen it, now whether that comes we'll be ready for it, but today, as Craig said, people are trading up for the new innovative product. I mean a classic example of that is you take a category like vinyl flooring, vinyl flooring was almost on its deathbed and then innovation came along and you now have vinyl plank flooring that is flying out of the stores at a premium price, it's a great value to the customer, it's easy to use, it's simple for the Pro and to install and that's a classic example of why innovation drive sales.\nScot Ciccarelli: And to be clear on the market front, like, Carol, you already mentioned, the LA market for example, any markets where you're starting to see trade down activity maybe particularly if you could focus on kind of overheated housing markets, or what you would view as where affordability isn't great?\nCraig Menear: I haven't seen anything like that at all.\nCarol Tome: Haven't seen it.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay, thank you guys.\nOperator: And we'll move on to Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great, thanks. Can you give any additional detail on the performance in Canada on a constant currency basis; I think you guys mentioned that the comps were positive, just curious how strong it was there?\nCraig Menear: Canada posted positive comps in local currency. Clearly there are pressures in Canada from a housing standpoint, the government has made a conscious decision to slow down housing in Canada and you see that in the numbers, but they delivered a great performance, we're seeing terrific online growth in Canada as a Canadian customer embraces e-commerce as well.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Okay and was there any impacts in the quarter from competitive pricing from other large players as they rationalized some inventory this quarter?\nCraig Menear: We're certainly seeing much more promotional activity as folks have made decisions to close stores and liquidate inventory.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Okay. You would - and then would you say that had a material impact on your sales this quarter or was it not enough to call out?\nCarol Tome: We don't know how to measure that.\nCraig Menear: No, we never had a clue how to measure that.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Alright, thanks.\nOperator: Next I move to Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Just to start off, last quarter you mentioned some cross functional teams focused on improving the experience online for customers, so maybe just expand on that. What do you see as your competitive advantage today online relative to peers and with personalization a big push, have you seen a benefit in terms of average order values or transactions when the sites customized based on prior purchases?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. Overall, absolutely, we're very pleased with the results from our initiatives as part of our investment strategy that we've laid out, supply chain is obviously a very big component of that but leaning into our online investments also a large piece of that. And we've started to do a lot of work with our category refreshes, I think this is a virtual reset online, a lot of work on our search efficacy, a lot of work with the supply chain team as they've gotten sharper on delivery in our delivery windows, we call it dynamic ETA. So when you're checking out, we would put before a broad brush seven to 10 days for delivery, now by zip code we can put the day that you'll be getting that product, all of these things have led to much better traffic. We had one of our strongest traffic quarters that we've seen in a number of years. Our visits were - our absolute increase in visits was our single largest growth in the quarter in visits and then it all resulted in the comp sales of 28%, and that's also due to increased conversions. So we're getting people to engage in to the side, the experience is getting to the right product, we're getting to the right close, all of this while more and more of the traffic moves to our mobile app in mobile devices and where we're seeing double digit increases in conversion rates and modest increase in average ticket, so very pleased with all of the initiatives.\nTed Decker: And clearly the customer is engaging obviously in the digital world, 40% of the orders in the quarter were picked up in store at the customer's choice. So this is truly an interconnected experience going forward, leveraging all the capabilities and assets of Home Depot in both the digital and physical world.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great, that's helpful and then just a quick follow up. Can you give an update on the store labor pilot? I believe you pointed to a sales lift in 2Q from the pilot, maybe better conversion and what not. So may be just discuss any potential uplift in sales from 3Q from the labor pilot and what's the trajectory for rolling that out ahead? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: It's easier for us to quantify the productivity that we enjoyed off of the new labor model which Ann-Marie has put into our stores. We saw 46 basis points of payroll leverage in the third quarter and a large part because of that new labor model. And we've fully rolled out -\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great, thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yeah, we've fully rolled out across the company, so we will get the full benefit in 2019.\nIsabel Janci: Porsha, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today will come from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.\nScott Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. So I just wanted to ask you Carol, if you look at the business, obviously we had a very sharp housing turn on 2008, but if we looked at the business, we just assume get a downturn because almost every investor seems to think. How do you think the business performs through the - through an average downturn if you guys looked at that? And then also, would you guys ever consider using your balance sheet more aggressively as we got into a situation like that? So that's my first question.\nCarol Tome: So what we've done is looked through the last recession which was just a crazy recession and went back to 2000 timeframe. The culture wasn't apparently mild recession and our comps at that point were flat, so we modeled flat comps to say that's the reasonable downturn. I don't know if that's reasonable, but I think it is reasonable. Staying true our investment plan because of the financial strength of the company, we can say true to our investment plan and we take our operating margin down to a little over 12%.\nScott Mushkin: I thought you said that kind of cut down all of it.\nCarol Tome: I'm sorry, we take our operating margin down to a little over 12% in a flat comp environment staying true to the investments. And we fully scale as a competitive advantage, we use it every day. As Ted mentioned we got lots of people coming knocking on our doors asking for things and we're working through that with the power of the Home Depot.\nScott Mushkin: Again as far as using the balance sheet a little bit more aggressively if we got into that downturn situation?\nCarol Tome: Yeah, that's our scale, we had the opportunity to do that, yeah.\nScott Mushkin: Alright, perfect. Thank you for taking my questions.\nIsabel Janci: Well, thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.\nOperator: That then will conclude today's call.

Welcome to the Home Depot Second Quarter 2018 Earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. If you would like to ask a question during today\u2019s conference, please press star, one on your touchtone telephone.  At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you and good morning everyone. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear, Chairman, CEO and President; Ted Decker, Executive Vice President of Merchandising, and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions.

If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Today\u2019s presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning everyone. We\u2019re very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, achieving a milestone of the highest quarterly sales and net earnings results in our company history. Sales for the second quarter were up $30.5 billion, up 8.4% from last year. Comp sales were up 8% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 8.1%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.05 in the second quarter. Our results in the second quarter reflected what we call the bathtub effect. As expected, the majority of seasonal sales we missed in the first quarter were recovered in the second quarter. We also continued to see broad-based strength across the store and all geographies. In the U.S., all three of our divisions posted positive comps in the second quarter, as did our 19 regions and top 40 markets. Internationally, Canada and Mexico posted mid to high single digit positive comps in local currency during the quarter. Our solid performance was driven by the outstanding execution of our store associates, merchants, suppliers and supply chain teams. Navigating a sudden spike in demand like the one we witnessed in May isn\u2019t easy. For example, in the northern division the variability in sales over a two-week period of time was as high as 2,770 basis points as the weather turned more favorable.  As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. We saw a healthy balance of growth from both our pro and DIY categories, with pro sales once again outpacing DIY sales in the quarter. The alignment of our Interline and legacy outside sales forces around four targeted end markets continues to gain traction. These sales professionals are experts in their respective fields, providing valuable insight and partnership to the pro customers that they serve. This in turn drives greater engagement and incremental spend. Our digital business continued to be a source of growth. Online traffic growth was healthy and second quarter online sales grew approximately 26% from the second quarter of 2017. Customers continue to respond to ongoing investments and enhancements we are making in support of the customer experience.  Delivering a best-in-class interconnected shopping experience encompasses much more than our digital properties and physical store assets. Our supply chain and the investments that we are making to enhance the delivery and fulfillment options available for customers is also an important area of focus. We have continued to develop and roll out new delivery capabilities. We have now rolled out small parcel express delivery from store via car and van in nearly all our major markets in the U.S., with plans for further expansion. Additionally, we told you that 2018 would be the year of the pilot as we test and learn with new fulfillment centers. I\u2019m pleased to report that we are on track with our plan and opened our first MDO, or Market Delivery Operation, during the quarter. In the second half of this year, we plan to open additional facilities. The opening of these facilities is a cross-functional endeavor. From our real estate team that locates the appropriate sites to our IT teams that develop the proprietary software that runs them and our supply chain team that owns execution throughout, the build-out of the One Home Depot supply chain is truly a collaborative team effort. I want to commend everyone for their work thus far in getting our five-year journey off to a strong start. Let me touch briefly on the progress we are making with some of our store investments. We have implemented our way-finding sign and store refresh package in over 500 stores year-to-date, ahead of our initial plan. We also continue to make progress on the rollout of our redesigned front end areas and BOPIS lockers, among other investments. We are only seven months into a three-year investing journey. We remain energized and excited about the work and the opportunities ahead. We\u2019re focused on improving the customer experience by investing in our business and in our associates.  Turning to the macro environment, the U.S. economy and drivers for home improvement spending are strong. As Carol will detail, because of our outperformance in the first half versus our plan, we are increasing our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect fiscal 2018 sales growth of approximately 7% and diluted earnings per share of $9.42.  I want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work and continued dedication to our customers as they once again successfully navigated our busiest selling season. Based on the first half results, 100% of our stores qualified for success sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. We are very proud of their efforts. With that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thank you, Craig, and good morning everyone. We had a strong quarter with results that exceeded our expectations. The team did a great job of maintaining excellent service levels while preserving high in-stocks over a period of elevated demand. Our core business continues to perform well and as expected we saw record sales in our garden business as spring broke across the country. Looking at our departments, lumber, indoor garden, outdoor garden, and electrical had double-digit comps in the quarter. Tools and appliances were above the company average. All other departments but lighting posted to mid-to-high single digit comps. Lighting had a low\u2013single-digit negative comp driven primarily by LED price deflation. In the second quarter, comp average ticket increased 4.9% and comp transactions increased 2.9%. Commodity price inflation in lumber, building materials and copper positively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 119 basis points. In addition to core commodity inflation, we are now experiencing inflation in other areas. These inflationary pressures come in many forms, including rising raw material costs and transportation costs along with recently enacted tariffs; however, as the customer\u2019s advocate for value, it is our job to work with our partners throughout the value chain to manage these pressures. Turning to big ticket sales in the second quarter, we\u2019ve previously defined big ticket sales as transactions over $900. Today, we are redefining big ticket sales as transactions over $1,000 as they now represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales. In the second quarter, transactions over $1,000 were up 10.6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. A few drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were vinyl plank flooring, appliances, and strength with our pro customers. In the second quarter, sales to our pro customers grew double digits Pro heavy categories like lumber, in-stock kitchens, power tools, windows, and concrete all recorded double digit comps. As you heard from Craig, our professional sales force is driving stronger relationships and a deeper level of engagement with our pro customers which in turn leads to higher sales. This partnership is particularly important with our MRO customers where we saw strong mid-single digit growth in the quarter. Sales to our DIY customers also showed solid results as they completed a variety of spring projects. Categories like lawnmowers, watering, patios, ceiling fans, and interior and exterior paint all had strong comps. In fact, our interior paint business had its best half performance in more than five years. While the favorable weather drove outdoor project activity, we also saw good performance in maintenance and repair categories during the quarter with great results in water heaters, HVAC, safety and security, and air circulation. During the quarter, we held our annual Memorial Day, Father\u2019s Day, and Red, White and Blue events. Our merchants\u2019 merchandising execution team in stores did a fantastic job bringing great value to our customer, which helped drive transactions both in store and online.  As part of our focus on balancing the art and science of retail, we have created approximately 50 cross-functional squads focused on agile development to improve the flexibility and ease of our online customer experience. As Craig called out, we saw strong growth in our online business driven in part by an increase in our conversion rates, and our interconnected retail offering is resonating with our customers as 47% of all of our online orders are picked up in the store. Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the third quarter. We are thrilled to announce our new appliance partnership with Bosch. Bosch is one of the largest home appliance manufacturers in the world and brings over a century of product innovation and engineering to the Home Depot. We are excited to offer a broad selection of their appliances, both in store and online. Most notably, Bosch is recognized as having the quietest and most reliable dishwasher on the market today, and they own the number one brand position in the category. Building on the success and momentum of our Life Proof carpet and vinyl plank, we are excited to introduce Life Proof slip resistant tile. Life Proof tile is 50% more slip resistant than ordinary tiles and is particularly good for wet areas like bathrooms, kitchens, and even outdoor patios. The innovative coating eliminates the need for a gritty texture and does not freeze, fade or crack. It is low maintenance and easy to clean. Life Proof tile is exclusive to the Home Depot. We\u2019re also excited to be introducing some great new innovation across our Husky tool portfolio. The growing Husky brand is owned and backed by the Home Depot and offers incredible value to our customers who need tough, quality tools and storage at affordable prices. In mechanics tools, we are introducing new impact sockets that offer easier access in tight spaces, and in plumbing tools we are introducing a ratcheting PVC pipe cutter that requires less force to cut and allows for easy single-hand operation. All of our Husky hand tools are backed by a lifetime warranty and can be replaced at any of our stores. In addition to great new products, we are excited about our upcoming events. As summer winds down and cooler temperatures arrive, we will have an incredible line-up of great values and special buys for our customers during our Labor Day and Halloween and Harvest events. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Ted, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, total sales were $30.5 billion, an increase of 8.4% from last year. Recall that at the beginning of fiscal 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard pertaining to revenue recognition. The new standard changes the geography of certain items on our income statement but has no impact on operating profit. In the second quarter, the change in accounting positively impacted sales growth by $33 million. Our total company comps were positive 8% for the quarter with positive comps of 11% in May, 7.5% in June, and 5.7% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 8.1% for the quarter with positive comps of 10.6% in May, 7.6% in June, and 6.3% in July. As you heard from Craig, our second quarter performance exemplified what we call the bathtub effect of a seasonal business; in other words, the majority of the seasonal sales missed in the first quarter due to inclement weather were recovered in the second quarter, and as you\u2019ve heard, we didn\u2019t just recover seasonal sales. Our total sales growth exceeded our expectations. One last comment on sales for the quarter. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible impact on sales growth.  In the second quarter, our gross margin was 34%, an increase of 36 basis points from last year. There were a number of factors that impacted our gross margin performance year over year, two of which can be isolated, and the third is just the net result of a number of factors. Specifically, we had $152 million of gross profit or 46 basis points of gross margin expansion due to the new accounting standard. We reported 16 basis points of gross margin contraction due to higher transportation and fuel costs in our supply chain, and finally we had 6 basis points of gross margin expansion due to the net result of a number of factors, including sales mix and the impact of recently acquired companies. For the year, we expect our gross margin rate to expand by approximately 41 basis points. This expansion is down slightly from our previous guidance due to higher than anticipated transportation costs in our supply chain. In the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased by 16 basis points to 17.9%, reflecting 90 basis points of expense leverage in BAU, or Business As Usual, offset by the impact of the new accounting standard and expenses associated with the strategic investment plan we laid out at our December investor conference. Expanding on this, the new accounting standard resulted in a $152 million increase in our operating expenses and caused 48 basis points of operating expense deleverage, and expenses related to our strategic investment plan of roughly $174 million resulted in approximately 58 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Given our strong first half performance, we now expect our fiscal 2018 operating expenses to grow at approximately 137% of our sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the second quarter was 16.1%, an increase of 21 basis points from last year. For the quarter, interest and other expense decreased by $3 million to $246 million, and our effective tax rate was 24.7% compared to 36.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in our effect tax rate reflects for the most part the benefit of tax reform. For the year, we continue to believe our effective tax rate will be approximately 26%. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $3.05, an increase of 35.6% from last year. Moving on to some additional highlights, during the quarter we opened one new store in Mexico for an ending store count of 2,286. Selling square footage at the end of the quarter was 238 million square feet. Total sales per square foot for the second quarter were $504, up 8.6% from last year. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $14 billion, up 9.1% from last year. Inventory turns were 5.4 times, up one tenth from last year.  In the second quarter, we repurchased $2 billion or approximately 9.3 million shares of outstanding stock. This included approximately 2.1 million shares on the open market and approximately 7.1 million shares repurchased through an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR program. We also received approximately 874,000 shares related to an ASR program we initiated in the first quarter. Note that for the shares repurchased under the second quarter ASR, it is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased in the second quarter will be determined in the third quarter when the second quarter ASR terminates. Year to date, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of our outstanding shares, and now we expect to repurchase approximately $6 billion of our outstanding shares for the year.  Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 37.9%, 590 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2017. As we look to the back half of the year, we continue to expect strong economic growth with the backdrop of a healthy home improvement environment. Homeowners continue to enjoy home price appreciation, and rising wages and low unemployment have driven consumer confidence to record high levels.  These trends are all supportive of our business, but we also know that in the second half of fiscal 2017 we experienced over $600 million of hurricane-related sales that we must comp, so today we are lifting our fiscal 2018 guidance primarily for our first half out performance. Now, if there is a bias in our forecast based on the economic environment and our August performance to date, the bias is to the up. Remember that we guide off GAAP. Recall that fiscal 2018 will include a 53rd week, so the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 will consist of 14 weeks. For fiscal 2018, we now expect sales to increase by approximately 7% with positive comps as calculated on a 52-week basis of approximately 5.3%. For earnings per share, we expect fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 29.2% to $9.42. Our earnings per share guidance includes our intent to repurchase approximately $3 billion of outstanding shares in the back half of fiscal 2018. With that, I would like to thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. Kat, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks, good morning everyone. Nice quarter. I wanted to first ask about the macro - probably will be a busy topic on it this morning. Look - there\u2019s a lot of noise out there, there\u2019s a lot of healthy metrics but there\u2019s also some cautionary ones. Curious, I guess the big one is home improvement demand and how it sort of disaggregates from declining existing home sales. Your guidance clearly doesn\u2019t imply that there\u2019s any reason to be worried, but curious how you look at the world now.\nCraig Menear: Simeon, we feel very positive about the strength of the home improvement sector and the customer\u2019s willingness to spend. I\u2019ll let Carol walk you through some of the details of how we actually think about it.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We\u2019ve expanded our thinking in this regard. We look at all housing metrics - housing turnover, home price appreciation, new household formation, the age of the housing stock, and of course housing starts, although that isn\u2019t as directly impacted to our business as the others. What we\u2019ve learned is that you can\u2019t look at any housing or home improvement driver in isolation because they all play off each other. Let\u2019s take housing turnover as an example. Housing turnover now stands at about 4% of units, and that is in part because we have a housing shortage in our country. We only have 4.1 months of supply against a normal month of supply more like six months of supply. With a housing shortage, home prices have appreciated. With home price appreciation, homeowners have more equity in their homes; in fact, home equity values have increased over 120% since 2011, about $73,000 per homeowner in terms of equity, so as homeowners view their home as an investment and not an expense, they spend more. If we look at correlating our comp sales against housing turnover going back to that number, to your point, we\u2019ve disconnected, and we think that really has to do with this housing shortage. In a normal housing environment where there\u2019s adequate supply, you see a pretty tight correlation between our comp sales and housing turnover, but now because we\u2019ve got this housing shortage, it\u2019s disconnected.  I could go on and on about the macro because I know there are a number of other things we could talk about. Craig, I don\u2019t know if you want me to continue on, or pause?\nCraig Menear: I think probably the biggest question that we get is around affordability as it relates to the housing environment, and with the increase in interest rates, when do we get worried about affordability. Again, Carol can walk through how we think about affordability, but the affordability factor with interest rates doesn\u2019t impact the majority of folks. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, I think it\u2019s so very important when you think about the affordability index, and we\u2019ve talked to you about this in the past, right now the affordability index for the country is 144, and if you look at the historical average, it\u2019s 127, so in the past we\u2019ve said, well, if it gets to 127, that could be a watch-out for us. But as we\u2019ve thought about it, we thought really you need to think about it on the margin, because if only 4% of housing units are turning in a year, that means 96% of homeowners are staying in their home and they don\u2019t care about rising interest rates, and in fact they love rising home prices because their equity is worth more. So really, when you think about affordability, it\u2019s the 96% of the housing units that are in place that are driving the home improvement spend and not so much the marginal turnover that the media tends to pay attention to. \nSimeon Gutman: Thanks for all that. I guess just following up on affordability, you have this visibility, we don\u2019t. There are some markets in which the affordability index has dropped a little more severe than the average. I know this quarter was really about seasonal and bathtub effect, but can you disaggregate those markets in which the affordability has deteriorated the most, and then what the top line trend, anything in those markets of note?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, so let\u2019s just take Seattle. Seattle, the home prices have been on fire, and on fire for a while. Our comp in the Seattle market in the second quarter was 7.7%. \nSimeon Gutman: Great, got it. Okay. Thank you.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Hi, thanks. Just on the expense front, Carol, your growth factor saw a little bit of a stepdown here versus the pace in the first quarter, despite the better comps. Just wondering if you could frame out some of the components for us - the BAU, and then also looking ahead into the third and fourth quarter, how you see it framing out.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure. In the second quarter, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we had 90 basis points of expense leverage in BAU. If you look at the drivers of those 90 basis points, roughly 50 of the basis points came from payroll and payroll related items. You\u2019ve heard Ann-Marie Campbell talk about a new labor model that she\u2019s introduced into the stores. We\u2019re driving productivity in our stores while at the same time increasing our customer reports - our customers are very happy with the service that they\u2019re getting in our stores. The rest of the leverage came from leveraging fixed costs as well as everything else. Productivity is a virtuous cycle here at the Home Depot, and when you put up a comp of 8% you expect to get pretty good expense leverage, and indeed we did. As we think about the balance of the year, our expense growth factor in the first half of the year was 139%. We would expect it to be around 135% for the back half of the year, giving us the guidance that we gave you of 137%. Just to comment on the quarters, we would think the expense growth factor would be slightly higher in the third quarter than the fourth quarter, because remember the fourth quarter has that extra week. \nChuck Grom: Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Then Craig, on the MDOs, you said you opened up one so far. Any learnings, any early learnings so far? Can you quantify how many you think you\u2019re going to do in the back half of the year, and bigger picture, how do you frame out the opportunity across the board?\nCraig Menear: First of all, it\u2019s very, very early to gather any learnings - we just got the facility open, but we\u2019re up and running and obviously learning as we go. We actually won\u2019t disclose how many we\u2019ll open in the back half, but if you think about the approach to this, and I\u2019ll let Marc jump in here, it is using the advantage that we\u2019ve built in our upstream network to actually feed the downstream opportunity that we have to continue to drive the way the customer wants to engage with us. Marc, I don\u2019t know if you have any additional comments?\nMarc Brown: Right, the market delivery operations that we built in is just part of our overall plan to drive the fastest, most efficient delivery in home improvement. It\u2019s just getting started there so it\u2019s very early days in terms of that, but this is one of those stockless locations that\u2019s a delivery hub in a local area and we deliver primarily appliances out of there at this point, but we\u2019ll be adding more products to that as we go. Expect more and we\u2019ll keep you posted as we go in the second half and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll continue on to Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. If we average out your comp transactions between the first and the second quarter, if you account for the seasonality and the seasonal shift between those two periods, it looks like it was up around 0.7%. That represents the slowest traffic growth in the last few years. Do you think that\u2019s a sign that maybe the cycle is entering the later stages, and what would cause that to reaccelerate this year?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We\u2019d probably need to look at your math, but when we look at our transactions for the second quarter and back out garden or our seasonal business, our comp transaction was up 1.6%. \nMichael Lasser: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Given all the discussion about tariffs and inflation, maybe you can tell us about your performance in the appliance category, particularly washing machines because that has been an area where there has been some significant pricing pass-through. Based on that experience, how do you see the next few quarters unfolding in terms of elasticity of demand as you try and navigate through what\u2019s probably going to be a hotter inflationary environment?\nCraig Menear: Michael, I would say at this point that the tariff environment is manageable, and given our sales and our size and scale, it\u2019s even that much more manageable. Overall on the lumber tariffs with Canada and the laundry tariffs on washing machines, as you mentioned, and the Section 301s that have come through, this is all low single digit percent of our COGS and 25-odd basis points of cost pressure. I mean, we are seeing increased cost requests from suppliers, particularly the ones that have been impacted by the tariffs, but as you can see, the overall size is very manageable at this point.  Now, there are some categories, and laundry being the most specific where you had up to 25 and 50% tariff if get over certain volumes of imports, for sure that elasticity showed up. You had mid-teen increase in the industry with laundry prices, and you did see some unit falloff there; but as the Korean manufacturers get their facilities up and running in Tennessee and South Carolina respectively, that tariff pressure will mitigate because they will be producing all their machines here domestically.\nMichael Lasser: Ted, just to follow up on that, is there anything that you can learn from the experience with washing machines that you might be able to apply to other categories, especially those ones that will be affected by the next round of tariffs?\nTed Decker: Sure. I think we take a portfolio approach to this, and we do not--you know, these tariffs are very specific. They\u2019re calling out products with specific dimensions, so it\u2019s not always even a category of goods, it\u2019s a specific unit or number of units within a category of goods. Yes, we apply learnings on elasticity and we\u2019re not necessarily taking a one-for-one retail with a cost increase. We manage at the portfolio level, and as I said, with this gross less than, you know, low single digit percent of COGS, it\u2019s well within our scope to manage this at the portfolio level.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you so much, and good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi.\nGeoff Small: Hello, this is Geoff Small on for Kate McShane. Thank you for taking our questions. We wanted to first dig into the second quarter sales result. You mentioned that the majority of lost sales from the first quarter were recovered in the second quarter. We were just wondering if you can quantify that amount and provide color if there will be any ongoing benefit in the third quarter, and just curious if you saw any ongoing benefit from the hurricane recovery in your second quarter results as well.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, we can unpack that 8% comp for you this way, and I\u2019m going to round to make it easy. About two points of growth came from our seasonal business, about one point of growth came from the index-based commodity categories that Ted called out on his call, another 1% came from hurricane-related sales, and then the remaining four came from everything else. \nGeoff Small: Understood, that\u2019s helpful. Just also wanted to dig into the comp performance of your newly remodeled and refreshed stores. I think 250 were completed in the first quarter and you\u2019re now through 500 of those stores. Can you provide any detail on the comp performance of those refreshed stores, and we\u2019re just also curious how many refreshes or remodels you expect to complete over the course of this year. \nMarc Brown: Obviously for competitive reasons, we\u2019re not going to call out performance of those stores, but we\u2019re continuing to roll that through the back half of the year.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, we\u2019re really excited about the execution of this initiative. In fact, if you look at the capital that we spent for the first six months of the year, 50% of that went into the stores. Our team\u2019s just doing a great job of putting in everything we said we were going to do.\nMarc Brown: Yes, we\u2019re super excited, so the greatest penetration of stores will get our new way-finding and sign package, which really brightens up the store and makes navigation of the store much easier. We also do, call it a general environmental clean-up of the stores, spiff the floors, add lighting, paint, remodel restrooms, breakrooms for the associates, etc., so very pleased with the look and feel, and our customer sat scores are trending up as we roll that out.  As Craig mentioned, we\u2019re doing lockers, we\u2019re rolling lockers out, revamping some front ends of the store, putting Buy Online Pickup In Store storage lockers into the stores, and also very excited to be rolling out electronic shelf labels. We\u2019ve not done this in the past and we\u2019re starting with our appliance department, and we\u2019ll do over half the stores this year with sort of iPad-sized electronic price signs and information on the appliance in our appliance departments.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: So this is not for the faint of heart, right? There\u2019s a lot going on inside the stores, but we\u2019ve piloted this for over a year before we even started to roll. Perhaps that\u2019s one reason why we\u2019re rolling faster than we thought we might.\nMarc Brown: Right.\nGeoff Small: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much, and best of luck in the third quarter.\nMarc Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now hear from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nSteve Forbes: Good morning. Regarding gross margin, were there any surprises this quarter? You called out transportation headwinds, 16 basis points, which I think is up about 8 basis points sequentially, but shrink wasn\u2019t called out, so is shrink improving, and how do you expect that transportation headwind to trend as we move into the back half of the year?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We, like the rest of the nation, are facing higher transportation and fuel costs, and we reflected that in the guidance that we gave for our gross margin for the year. Now, we expect an expansion of 41 basis points for the year; last quarter, we expected 44 basis points, so we have factored that. We\u2019re doing our best to manage through it, but there is a real issue in the transportation markets in our country. On the shrink side, shrink was one of those other factors when I called out the drivers of gross margin performance, the change in accounting, transportation and then all other. Shrink was in that all other bucket of 6 basis points of expansion. It was actually a hurt in the quarter, but we were able to offset with actually the benefits coming off of the newly acquired companies. We\u2019ve got a cross-functional team that\u2019s working on shrink, and just yesterday we had a really great report out. We\u2019ve hired a new loss prevention officer into our company and we\u2019re excited about that.\nSteve Forbes: Then just a quick follow-up, right, because you called out that 100% of the stores quality for profit sharing this quarter. How did that compare to last year as we conceptualize the year-over-year impact from the stronger performance of the business broadly, and how do we think about that impact for the full year?\nCraig Menear: It was for the first half, and if I recall correctly, I think for the first half last year, we were 100% for our stores as well. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, we might have--\nCraig Menear: Yes, it might have been two stores that missed last year.\nSteve Forbes: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. \nSeth Sigman: Thanks for taking the question. Nice quarter, guys. A couple follow-up questions here. First, just in terms of the inflation impact on comps that you talked about, just to clarify, it sounds like the bulk of the impact is really just on commodity items at this point. I wasn\u2019t sure, are you expecting to see more increases in some of the non-commodity items as you move through the year, and then I\u2019m also just wondering from a competitive perspective, are you seeing any of your competitors handle the inflation differently, meaning maybe not pass as much through, get more aggressive, etc.? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: So yes, at this point by far the largest impact is the 119 basis points that we called out from core commodities. There are puts and takes in that, but for the most part, Seth, lumber for example is priced weekly, and you might have some differential on a SKU or market here or there, but those tend to be priced competitively by everyone across the marketplace. We don\u2019t see large impacts in the second half from the non-commodity, and in fact commodity has come down meaningfully, lumber and copper each which are behind the 119 basis points, have moved down over the last eight weeks. So if you look at lumber prices, we are now on framing only 4% ahead of last year, and the peak there was about 40%, so we\u2019re not going to see the same lumber inflation in the back half. Panel prices again were 35 or 40% above LY, and that\u2019s now at about 1% over last year. The good news is, we spoke about it elasticity earlier - I mean, a 40% increase, and we saw such a sharp and quick run-up in lumber prices, we were starting to see an impact in units, but over the last six, seven, eight weeks as these prices have come down, units have responded nicely, so we\u2019ll take the volume any day over price in commodities. \nSeth Sigman: Okay, thanks for that color. Then my follow-up is on the digital business, up 26% - a nice acceleration. I think it contributed 170 basis points to the comps, which is really one of the strongest we\u2019ve seen, so my question is, is this driven by the seasonal shift, was there a benefit from that or something else that maybe you can point to that you think is driving that strength? I think a lot of it is still coming from the store or picked up in the store. I\u2019m just curious what are you seeing that\u2019s helping drive that acceleration. Thanks.\nCraig Menear: Yes, I\u2019ll make a comment and I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin. Overall strength in our online business but certainly supported as well with the seasonal categories, so it\u2019s interesting but seasonal businesses pick up in the online space just like they do in the physical space.\nKevin Hoffman: Yes, and certainly we saw balanced growth with both traffic and conversion as we continue to just manage the shift to mobile as well. We had really solid progress with our mobile properties, and we had strength across the store, as Craig mentioned. Real strength in the seasonal businesses really helped. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: And 47% of our online orders are picked up inside of the store, so we\u2019re really driving this interconnected experience. \nSeth Sigman: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays.\nMatt McClintock: Hi, good morning everyone. Craig, you talked about rolling out small parcel across all major markets now. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the experience of what you\u2019re seeing in the business in those markets when that capability is rolled out. Thanks. \nCraig Menear: Sure, I\u2019ll make a comment and I\u2019ll turn it over to Marc. We\u2019re actually very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing here, and it gives us the capability to offer different value propositions to our customers, so a customer who needs a smaller delivery, we can do that much more effectively and much faster for them, and then it\u2019s providing leverage into our overall delivery capability, right Marc? \nMarc Brown: That\u2019s right. I mean, again on the theme of the fastest, most efficient delivery in home improvement, certainly we\u2019re fast when we have car and van same-day delivery available from our stores in all of our major markets. We\u2019re almost there with all of our major markets. What we\u2019d say about that is it\u2019s great because that\u2019s incredibly fast, but it also has great coverage. We\u2019d match of our coverage of same-day delivery up against anyone in the marketplace, and we would say that our home improvement capability is unmatched in the marketplace.Kevin mentioned the drivers of digital growth. One of those is increased conversion due to faster delivery. \nMatt McClintock: Thanks for that. Then Carol, if I could ask a follow-up just on the macro, I understand that you\u2019ve got to look at everything holistically, but is there any independent impact on certain product categories with housing turnover being as low as it is? I\u2019m just trying to parse through with the 96% of people that are staying in their house, 4% that are moving, does that actually have an outsized impact on specific product categories, or not? Thanks.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Let\u2019s just look at the math of housing turnover. With 4% of units turning, that\u2019s about 5 million households turning, and I\u2019m looking at occupied households today - that\u2019s 5 million units turning. The average spend is $3,500 a unit, so that means the market opportunity for housing turnover is $17.5 billion. If you use our NAICS market share of 28%, that gets you $5 billion-ish of sales, so $5 billion-ish of sales on our base of $100 billion suggests that turnover just isn\u2019t that important. Just for fun, I modeled what could happen using that simple math if turnover were to decline 15%. No one is projecting that, but modeled it just for fun, and the impact on comps, because again it\u2019s not very big, was less than 1%.  So to your specific question about category-specific, we have no insight there, but I\u2019d bring it up to 40,000 feet and say it\u2019s just not that important.\nCraig Menear: I guess the only comment I\u2019d make on categories, if you think about the number one project would be painting, and you would think that if there was going to be an impact, it would be there, we just had our best paint quarter in five years.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Right, exactly. Good point.\nMatt McClintock: Fair enough. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit to the traction you\u2019re having in home furnishings? It\u2019s a category I believe you\u2019re leaning into more with SKU count additions, so any color there would be helpful.\nTed Decker: Sure. Very early days. As you say, we\u2019re adding a number of SKUs in things like tabletop, in d\u00e9cor, in rugs, etc. Very early days, but pleased with our traction. Significant growth, but on a low base. We\u2019ve completed the integration of the company store, and one of our first integration moves was to list a lot of their better sellers on the Home Depot website, so that just went live some weeks ago and starting to see an uptick there. This is all a journey for our customers to find this product on our website and engage with the Home Depot in these adjacent, but we think very relevant categories. \nCraig Menear: If you think about the data that shows that average number of retailers that customers shop in roughly the last four years has declined from 13 to 9, and our consumer research said that the customer trusts us to bring value and questions why we don\u2019t help them fulfill the balance of their needs in their home, this is an opportunity for us as we go forward largely as this business continues to shift to the digital world, so you should think about this as a digital strategy. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Great, thanks so much. Just a quick follow-up, any updates on the B2B site that you\u2019re developing for the pros? Is that currently being piloted in select markets? Any update there would be great, thanks.\nCraig Menear: Sure, I\u2019ll let Bill address that.\nBill Lennie: When we talked about this last December, we said this was a two to three-year journey, and it will be to build out all the tools and applications that our professional business customers need. We\u2019re still in the customer intercept interview phase and we\u2019re in testing mode, so we\u2019ll probably get a couple of customers over on kind of a small test as we go through Q3, but we\u2019ll see more activity around this space in Q4. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: We saw a demo of it yesterday, though, and the demo looked good. We\u2019ve got to get it now out of beta into the customer hands, but it looked pretty good.\nBill Lennie: Good progress as we lean into the initiative.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great, thank you, guys.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now go to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. \nMatt Fassler: Thanks so much, and good morning everyone. My first question relates to inventory - obviously you had a very healthy quarter. The inventory was up around the pace of sales but a bit more so that in Q1, and a bit above the rate of sales growth that you seem to anticipate for the second half of the year. Any color on what drove the increase would be terrific.\nTed Decker: Matt, the main thing there is we\u2019re investing at an accelerated rate in merchandising resets. The inventory from a seasonal perspective is in great shape. We\u2019re at record high levels of in-stock, which we felt was critically important to be able to capture the sales that we did in the second quarter, but the main reason for the increase is the add-on of new businesses and the investment in accelerated merchandising resets.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Right, and just the capital associated with our merchandising resets alone this year is $275 million, so we\u2019re investing into this for the long term customer experience.\nMatt Fassler: Got you, and then a second question just on the sales for the second half, you don\u2019t typically guide precisely to the quarter, so can you give us a sense of whether that second half sales guidance as you presented it today, what was implied in the business plan at the end of Q1, and then also any comments just given the storm impact on Q3 versus Q4 and the anticipated pace of business?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Right, so based on the guidance that we gave today, the comps in the second half of the year would be lower than the first half of the year; but Matt, the stacks, the two-year stacks will be identical. Our two-year stack in the first half was over 12, so that gives you a sense. There\u2019s no deceleration happening in the business. On the storm side, I called out about a point of growth from hurricane related sales in the second quarter. We recovered $500 million of the $600 million we had last year, so we think we\u2019ll get another $100 million in Q3-ish - Q3, Q4-ish, but remember then we have to comp all the stuff, so this is a relative comparison. Does that make sense?\nMatt Fassler: Got you, it does. Finally, you spoke about inflation earlier in the call. You started to see inflation last year but it\u2019s been quite persistent, so any sense for the inflation backdrop embedded in that second half guide?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: There isn\u2019t any.\nCraig Menear: Matt, we\u2019re seeing the commodity side of the inflation mitigate. It\u2019s really going away, so.\nMatt Fassler: Okay, thank you so much, guys.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now go to Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.\nBudd Bugatch: Thank you very much for taking my question, and congratulations on the quarter. Most of my questions have been asked, so I\u2019m just going to go with one small question and talk about pro penetration. You\u2019ve had some really great growth in pro, and I think penetration last we knew was, like, 40% of sales. Has that moved off at all with the continuing outpacing of pro?\nCraig Menear: Yes, actually we are seeing movement on that as we\u2019ve consistently had our pro business growth accelerate against our growth in DIY, so we are seeing that.\nBill Lennie: Matt, this is Bill Lennie. We would peg that growth or that pro penetration closer to 45% today. We\u2019ve seen several years of growth where pro has outpaced consumer. Consumer strength has been there, but it\u2019s the activity in the home investment that Carol spoke to. The pro growth has exceeded that, and we\u2019d peg it at about 45%.\nBudd Bugatch: And Bill, to your particular area, the integration of the outside sales force and the inside sales force, can you give us a little bit of flavor where that is in the Interline integration today? You\u2019ve made a lot of progress, I know, but where is that and what have you been pleased by?\nBill Lennie: Craig in his opening comments spoke about integrating our outside sales force - that\u2019s been completed. We\u2019re seeing great collaboration across the organizations, which is allowing us to cross-sell between Interline\u2019s inventories and Home Depot\u2019s inventories. Our sales professionals really provide a service beyond just product for our customers. They are experts in their field, and with that, it does drive engagement, so we\u2019ve seen great strength both in store and outside of the store, particularly with our MRO accounts, so that integration continues to progress nicely. \nBudd Bugatch: Thank you very much. Good luck on the second half.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. With respect to your online business, would you say there are any particular categories where you tend to over-index relative to your overall mix; and conversely, what are the categories that maybe haven\u2019t resonated with the consumers, haven\u2019t seen that response yet? Curious if you could talk about the dynamics there.\nTed Decker: I actually think what I\u2019d say is we\u2019ve seen kind of the opposite effect. I think there were categories that we anticipated the customer may not engage in the digital world, but that shopping experience actually starts in the digital world, even if it finishes in the physical world. So if you think about things like flooring or doors, which you would traditionally think of as a category that would be purchased in store, in most cases the shopping experience actually starts in the digital world. We\u2019ve seen really nice engagement with the customer really across categories.\nZach Fadem: That\u2019s interesting. To follow up on the pro, could you talk about any impact you\u2019re seeing from your data initiatives, and any evidence today that you\u2019re gaining share of the pro wallet? Then just with respect to the categories, where do you see the biggest opportunities to gain pro share? Thanks.\nBill Lennie: Just a quick comment on the pro data. We have--through my view, and our tools at the Pro Desk have been able to provide better insights for our in-store pro sales associates, and we\u2019ve seen growth across all of our managed accounts and our portfolios. But the fastest growing segment of our pro business is the pros that are in our stores and covered by [indiscernible], so it just shows as we provide insights, we can give them some guided selling tools, they engage more with the customers, can provide better insights for us what services and what products we can provide. That just leads to engage and pro growth, so strength has really been outpaced in-store versus our outside sales, which is all about execution and in-stocks and great relationships.\nZach Fadem: Got it, thanks for the color. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JP Morgan. \nChris Horvers: Thanks, good morning. A couple of follow-up questions. I guess the first question is there\u2019s been a lot of management changes at your largest competitor, and I know it\u2019s early, but are you seeing any difference in terms of how they approach the market, whether from a customer service perspective yet or from a promotional perspective, or any other changes?\nCraig Menear: Chris, our job is to focus on our customer. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on doing.\nChris Horvers: Understood. Then besides appliances, you don\u2019t bake market share gains into your guide. Can you talk about how you assess your performance relative to the market? In 2Q overall, did you gain share, and any sense on the breakdown in share between share capture in DIY versus pro?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Oh, if only we had that insight into share capture DIY versus pro. As you know, market share is a bit elusive for us. The best we can do is look at the NAICS 4441, and if we look at the NAICS 4441, it would suggest that we gained share in the second quarter.\nChris Horvers: And then the last question, as you think about your outlook for market growth in the back half of the year, has there been any changes since you put out the initial guidance in 4Q, or since the 1Q update?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: No, home price appreciation is doing exactly what we thought it would do. Household formation is trending the way that we thought it would. The age of the houses - well, they\u2019re getting older. Housing turnover is the only on that slowed down a little bit, but again it\u2019s not that important. It\u2019s a driver of spend, not a driver of growth.\nChris Horvers: Thanks very much. Best of luck.\nIsabel Janci: Kat, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Good morning, congrats on a very nice quarter. Most of my questions have been asked answered, so I\u2019ve just got really one quick one here. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion about lapping the hurricanes in the second half of this year. As we look at what\u2019s happening now in the west coast of the United States with fires out there, what type of--how does Home Depot typically react with that? Is there an initial wave of demand that comes, is there a long term demand that comes as a result of that activity? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: The first thing I\u2019d say is, boy, our thoughts and prayers go to all the folks that are being impacted here. It\u2019s a horrible situation for sure, and for us, the good news is that we don\u2019t have any structures that have been impacted, but we certainly have associates and customers who have been impacted. It\u2019s just a tough situation for sure. Fires are a tough thing, because basically fires destroy everything and essentially you\u2019re in a new rebuild from that point forward. That\u2019s obviously not the focus of our business, it\u2019s not where our strength or focus is, so no. It\u2019s a tough deal for those affected and we feel for everybody that\u2019s going through this, and we certainly hope for the safety of all the folks battling the blazes, our first responders. \nBrian Nagel: Got it. Congrats again on the quarter. Thanks.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call in November.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Welcome to The Home Depot First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Isabel Janci, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Katherine. And good morning. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear, Chairman, CEO and President, Ted Decker, Executive Vice President of Merchandising, and Carol Tome, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors and as a reminder we would appreciate it if participants would limit themselves to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call Investor Relations at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel. And good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $24.9 billion, up 4.4% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.2% from last year with the US comps of positive 3.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.08 in the first quarter. We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter and the fundamentals of our business remains solid. As Ted will detail, excluding weather impacted categories, our pro and core interior project business remained strong in the quarter and we saw healthy growth in maintenance and repair categories. From a geographic perspective, weather impacts can be seen in the variability of performance across Canada, our three US divisions and 19 regions. Our largest division is the Northern division, which posted flat comps due to weakness in our seasonal categories. The Southern and Western divisions saw relatively better weather trends and comped above the company average. On the international front, Canada posted a slightly negative comp in local currency while Mexico posted positive comps in local currency. You've heard us talk about the bathtub effect based on when spring breaks where weak seasonal sales in the first quarter are counterbalanced by strength in the second quarter. We expect that effect to be true this year, and over the past few weeks, as Spring has finally arrived through the US and Canada, we are seeing strong customer demand. Part of the strength we saw in the business can be attributed to the health of our Pro customer as Pro sales once again outpaced DIY sales in the quarter. Investments aimed at deepening our relationship with our Pro customers are yielding increased engagement, which translates to incremental spend. While still early, the combination of enhanced associate tools in the store and expanded delivery capabilities are gaining traction with the Pros. In delivery, for example, we augmented our two hour and four hour delivery window options with same day car and van delivery in select markets. These efforts help drive double-digit delivered sales growth in the quarter. Our interconnected retail strategy continues to resonate with our customers. Online traffic growth was healthy and our first quarter online sales grew approximately 20% from the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter, we began to launch the customer's ability to attach install services when they buy certain products online in select markets. For example, in certain markets, if you purchase a faucet online and want to include the installation of the faucet in your purchase we now enable this experience. We continue to invest in the interconnected shopping experience and see a positive response from our customers in the form of improved customer satisfaction scores, better conversion and increased sales. As we continue to make the shopping experience more convenient for our customers, another area of focus and differentiation is our supply chain. The flexibility of our supply chain is a competitive advantage, particularly when unpredictable weather results in spiky demand patterns. And stock levels are at record highs as our shelf shelves are fully stocked with products our customers need to get their projects done. Let me touch briefly on our long-term strategic priorities. You will recall at our Investor Conference in December, we outlined our commitment to accelerated investment plan to create the One Home Depot experience for our customers. I'm pleased to report that our key initiatives are on track. We implemented our enhanced way finding sign and store refresh package in nearly 250 stores during the quarter and intend to pilot our first new supply chain facility starting this summer. It's still early days, but we remain very excited about the work and opportunities ahead as we focus on enhancing the customer experience by investing in our business and in our associates. Our associate's consistently execute. A delay in the spring selling season is not without its challenges. But given the company wide alignment and coordination of our store teams, merchants, vendor partners and supply chain, coupled with a favorable housing backdrop, we are poised to deliver strong 2018. I'd like to close by thanking our associates for their dedication, hard work and commitment to our customers. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. As you heard from Craig, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter. Excluding our seasonal business, sales exceeded our expectations. We saw significant strengthen in our pro business, interior projects and maintenance and repair categories. The extreme winter weather in the quarter had a negative impact on our garden categories, which historically represents around 15% to 20% of our first quarter sales. Our garden departments had negative comps in the quarter, driven by softness in chemicals, fertilizer, mulch and live goods, just to name a few. Looking at our departments, appliances, electrical and lumber had double-digit comps in the quarter. Lighting in our garden departments were negative with the lighting comps reflection of LED price deflation, all other merchandising departments were at or above the company average. In the first quarter, comp average ticket increased 5.8% and comp transactions decreased 1.5%. If we exclude our garden business, we saw positive comp transaction growth. Commodity price inflation in lumber, building materials and copper positively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 111 basis points. Foreign exchange rates also positively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 41 basis points. Our cold and wet weather impacted some outdoor related projects. This didn't prevent our customers from completing a variety of interior projects. Categories like interior doors, bath fixtures, storage and organization, interior paint, door locks, ceiling fans and window treatments all had comps above the company average. Floor maintenance and repair categories also performed well during the quarter with strong results in safety and security, water heaters, plumbing repair, pipe and fitting and air circulation. As you heard from Craig, in the first quarter, we saw continued traction with our Pro. Pro heavy categories like lumber, gypsum, insulation, pneumatics, wiring devices and flooring tools all had comps above the company average. In addition, we are building engagement and enabling our associates to target specific customers, which is driving expansion of categories and services sold. In Interline Brands alone, we saw sales growth ahead of the company average. We also saw healthy customer appetite for big ticket projects. Big ticket sales in the first quarter or transactions over $900 were up 10%. The increase in big ticket sales was driven in part by vinyl plank flooring, appliances and various lumber and building materials categories. In the first quarter, we hosted our President's Day and ends Spring Black Friday events. Our stores did a fantastic job executing these events, and our customers responded. During the event, we saw great results in several tool categories and cleaning. One of our core strategies as merchants is the balance the art and science retail, both in-store and online. Over the last year, we made several improvements to our interconnected shopping experience, including better product content, a refreshed mobile experience, improved inventory visibility and faster checkout. These investments have helped drive a more seamless, frictionless customer experience and conversion rates in the first quarter increased more than 10% year-over-year across all devices. Now let's turn our attention to the second quarter. Just in time for the warmer weather, we are excited to introduce a fantastic new innovative product in our outdoor garden category. We have partnered with Singenta and Firmly to bring our new real depleting new plants to market. These plants are low maintenance, drought tolerant and have reoccurring blooms throughout the growing seasons. Rio is available in all of our US stores and is a big box exclusive to The Home Depot. In addition, we are very happy to announce an extension of our KPMG [ph] partnership with the launch of Olympic exterior stains. With this launch, Olympic brings 80-years of trust and brand recognition into our stores. These broadens our assortment in our paint department, providing customers choice with a strong line of products across the category. We are also thrilled about new product offerings across all of our categories in our upcoming events. During the second quarter, we will host our Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events, where we will be offering more great values and special buys for our customers. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Ted. And good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our first quarter results, I want to mention a change in our accounting policy. During the quarter, we adopted ASU number 2014-09, which pertains to revenue recognition. This standard changes the way we account for certain items related to our private label credit card and gift card programs. While the new standard changes the geography of certain items on our income statement, it has no impact on operating profit. Looking at our first quarter results, the change in accounting caused a $131 million increase to gross profit and a corresponding $131 million increase to operating expenses. Note that the $131 million increase in gross profit was driven by a $33 million net increase in sales and a $98 million decrease in cost of goods sold. While we did not recast our historical financial statements to reflect to this accounting change, included in today's press release is a quarterly Pro forma view that shows the impact to the accounting standard as if it had been in place during fiscal 2017. So with that, let's move on to our first quarter results. In the first quarter, total sales were $24.9 billion, an increase of 4.4% from last year. Versus last year, a weaker US dollar positively impacted total sales growth by approximately $104 million or 0.4%. Our total company comps were positive 4.2% for the quarter with positive comps of 5.6% in February, 5.9% in March and 2.2% in April. Comps in the US were positive 3.9% for the quarter with positive comps of 5.1% in February, 5.5% in March and 2% in April. As you may have personally experienced, April was one of the coldest and snowiest months in more than 20-years. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.5%, an increase of 40 basis points from last year. The increase in our gross margin year-over-year reflects the following factors: First, we experienced $131 million or 48 basis points of gross margin expansion due to the new accounting standard. Second, we experienced 14 basis points of gross margin expansion due to changes in mix and the gross margin benefit of recent acquisitions. Finally, we experienced 22 basis points of gross margin contraction due to higher shrink and higher transportation costs in our supply chain than what we experienced last year. In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales, increased by 87 basis points to 21%. Our operating expense reflects the impact of the new accounting standard, the impact of the strategic investment plan we laid out at our December investor conference and ongoing expense control. Specifically, the new accounting standard resulted in a $131 million increase in our operating expenses and cost 50 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Expenses related to our strategic investment plan resulted in approximately 56 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Finally, we drove 19 basis points of expense leverage due to ongoing productivity actions in the core business. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 13.6%, a decrease of 47 basis points from last year. For the quarter, interest and other expense decreased by $2 million to $239 million and our effective tax rate was 23.5% compared to 35.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in our effective tax rate reflects for the most part, the benefit of tax reform. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26%. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $2.08, an increase of 24.6% from last year. Moving on to some additional highlights. During the quarter, we opened one new store in Stamford, Connecticut for an ending store count of 2,285. Volume square footage at the end of the quarter was 238 million square feet. Total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $412, up 4.5% from last year. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $14.4 billion, up 6% from last year. Inventory turns were 4.9 times, up slightly from last year. While spring was a reluctive bride, she has arrived, and our stores have the inventory necessary to meet demand, which is a good thing as month to date, for the company, our May comp sales are double-digit positive. Moving on to capital allocation. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1 billion or approximately 4.7 million shares of outstanding stock. As of today, we are targeting $4 billion of share repurchases for fiscal 2018. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 36%, 370 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As we look to the remainder of the year, we are encouraged by what we are seeing in housing and the broader economic environment. The US economy is strong and housing fundamentals continue to be supportive of our business. Unemployment is the lowest it has been since 2000. Wages are increasing. Home prices are appreciating, void by a housing shortage in the US, and while interest rates are rising, this is indicative of a strong economy. At these levels, we do not expect interest rates to lead to a slowdown in customer desires or demand. That's why today, we are reaffirming the sales and earnings per share growth guidance that we laid out at our fourth quarter earnings call, adjusting certain items solely for the change in accounting standard. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. The new accounting standard will not affect our earnings per share guidance, but it will impact sales growth and the gross margin and expense growth factor guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. Recall that fiscal 2018 will include a 53rd week, so the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 will consist of 14 weeks. For fiscal 2018, we now expect sales to increase by approximately 6.7% with positive comps as calculated on a 52 week basis of approximately 5%. Reflecting the new accounting standard, we now expect our 2018 gross margin to increase by approximately 45 basis points. Also reflecting the new accounting standard, we now expect our 2018 operating expenses to grow at approximately 144% of our sales growth rate. For earnings per share, we expect fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 28% to $9.31. I also want to take a brief moment to comment on our long-term financial targets. The new accounting standard does not change our sales growth or operating margin targets for fiscal 2020. Because the accounting change did affect the geography of certain items on the income statement, we have posted an update to our December investor conference materials on our website to assist you with your modeling. And with that, I'd like to thank you for your participation in today's call. And Katharine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is all about weather, and it's got a couple parts. Can you clarify, you said garden was negative. Is April the largest month for garden? And then you also mentioned that Northern is your biggest division. If we assume it's, let's say, 40%, I think that would imply Southern, Western would be north of likes 6%, 6.5%. Is that fair?\nCraig Menear: So in terms of garden, April is not necessarily the biggest month in garden generally, that is May. And we actually don't break out the divisional numbers. But Northern division is our largest division.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And maybe just a follow-up. Were the remaining divisions, I guess, Southern and Western, were those trajectory similar or were there a big discrepancy between them? And then have their quarter-to-date trends held up? I'm assuming Northern is the one that's been broken - that's breaking out, but has Southern and Western stayed the same or strengthened?\nCraig Menear: Actually, all areas are breaking out with this change in the weather.\nCarol Tome: We're so pleased with the performance across our geographies. And if you look at the performance in the first quarter, the Southern division had a slightly higher comp than the Western division. But remember, the Southern division has some hurricane related sales in it. So if you normalize for hurricanes, the divisions performed pretty much the way they should have performed. It was really in the north and it come back and the whole business is coming back.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And my follow-up question. I think the issue of the markets contemplating here is the cycle question versus what the weather is doing. And so I don't know how you look at it, but if there is something that's slowing that's more than weather and it doesn't seem like that's the case. I guess, how obvious are these signals and how much lead time do you think you have to be able to see them?\nCraig Menear: I mean, first of all, this clearly is really a garden story for us. The miss in terms of garden was significant against what we planned.\nCarol Tome: And Craig, maybe we could just quantify that for you. If you back up the gardens, our comp for the quarter would have been 6.5%.\nSimeon Gutman: All right. Okay. Well, thank you for the color and good quarter other than the weather.\nCraig Menear: Thank you\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So of that 230 basis point impact from the weather, is that a net number, so that's net of the hurricane benefit? And what percentage of that - of those sales do you expect to recoup in the second quarter?\nCraig Menear: The storm affected sales were roughly 135 basis point impact. And we actually expect to capture the majority of those sales and as we're seeing that happen in May.\nMichael Lasser: And my second question is on the initiatives that you outlined. Both the 200 stores that you touched with the new signage package, what comp are you seeing those stores produce above and beyond the corporate average? And then as part of that, can you also touch on your Pro delivery initiatives? Is that helping you more with existing customers or customers who really haven't done business with in the past?\nCraig Menear: So let me \u2013 I'll touch on the store a minute here and then Mark Holifield is here and can speak to the delivery. 250 stores that we implemented is signing and refresh packaging. We're obviously just completing those. We did that investment for our stores over a couple of year period, or doing that because of the pilots that we ran previous to that. And so we've built that lift into our guidance. And that's something that we're rolling here over the next two years across all the stores.\nMark Holifield: And Craig on the new delivery that's out there, the car and van delivery that's really driving sales across the range. We have a lot of buy online, deliver from Store customers who are trying out the car and van delivery. And our Pro customers, our existing Pro customers and new customers are using the do for on that.\nCarol Tome: So our map isn't perfect, but our modeling would suggest that the majority of these delivered sales are incremental.\nMichael Lasser: Incremental for customers that you are already doing business with or more so attracting customers who you both got it. All right. Thank you so much and good luck.\nCarol Tome: Yeah. Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll continue on to Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.\nZach Fadem: Hey. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment in the paint category. Have you started to see any step change there in terms of promotions? Any thoughts on what you think the key drivers are for you to maintain and when sharing the category this year?\nCraig Menear: Sure, I would say that the paint promotional environment is certainly for us, it's the exact same year-over-year. We are not seeing any more promotion out of others in the marketplace either. We are very happy with our paint performance. Our comp was at the company average and we saw the strongest interior paint comp gallon performance we've seen in a long time. So we are happy with our brands. We have the best brand with their in the marketplace. We're thrilled with our expansion of PPG and Ann and team are doing a fantastic job of selling in the stores.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And to follow-up, is input cost for items like lumber and building materials continue to grind higher. First of all what are your expectations there for the year. And is there any concern in your mind on your ability to pass along the higher prices to customers in this environment?\nCraig Menear: Well, the two areas we've seen, the largest cost request are in clear commodities. So looking at lumber and copper for example, those generally are the market passes on, most of those products are priced weekly and well known pricing indexes in the market tends to follow that. So we've had no problem passing that on. I will say lumber in panel prices are at historic highs. We don't see that abating at all. We're up about 30% year-over-year. Certainly, don't wanted to go a whole lot higher. But for right now we've been able to pass on and not seeing degradation in units. The other area and things like laundry where you had a very specific tariff. The entire industry has accepted that the cost increase based on the tariffs and you're seeing retails in all competitors that have gone up more or less mirroring the impact from the tariff.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Thanks so much guys appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Forbes of Guggenheim Securities.\nSteve Forbes: Good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nSteve Forbes: Craig, you mentioned piloting the first new supply chain facility this summer. But can you tell us or help expand on that and what type of facility is it in and maybe just give us your updated plan for this year as far as how many and what type of facilities you plan on opening in 2018?\nMark Holifield: It\u2019s Mark Holifield here. The facilities we are going to be doing first are market delivery operations which are the hubs out there. These are stockless locations that will be delivery hubs for big and bulky products like appliances and vanity's and things like that. Later this year we'll be testing our flatbed distribution capability and opening our first local direct fulfillment center.\nCarol Tome: And Steve, I'd like you to remember that this is a 5 year plan. We've committed $1.2 billion in our supply chain over the next 5 years. We will spend as much in year four and five as we do in year one through three. So it\u2019s definitely going to ramp up over time.\nMark Holifield: Yes so I mean, perhaps the way to think about this is if you think back to our RDC rollout years ago, in the first year 2007 we had exactly one RDC. In 2008, we did four, 2009, we did seven, 2010 we did seven. So you'll see a ramp somewhat similar to that across the five years of supply chain transformation ahead.\nSteve Forbes: Thank you. And then just a quick follow up, on retail services, so recognize the percentage of revenue here. But it's a topic I find interesting as you think about the opportunity to build brand awareness and share of wallet right with the DIY consumer here. So can you touch on how that business performed during the quarter?\nMark Holifield: Yes, our services business represents about 4% of our total sales and grew low single digit, really driven by HVA window treatment.\nSteve Forbes: Thank you.\nMark Holifield: But too much exterior business happening.\nSteve Forbes: Thank you. \nOperator: We'll continue on to Keith Hughes of SunTrust.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. Credit question, specifically in flooring, you did very well in flooring particularly carpets, kind of a declining industry, but as you called out luxury vinyl plank, I assume you mean LVT there is growing well. Could you talked about your heart service offering? How that's growing? And which sees the future?\nCraig Menear: Yes. Overall flooring again, we're very happy. Our comps in flooring were above the company average for sure led by the LVT. That product is just a fantastic product, solid or waterproof, a final product that looks like tile and or lead. The rest of the business is solid. I mean a lot of sales moving into that LVT product, but you know the rest of the business is sort of low single digit comp.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Tori on for Chris.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: For some prior quarters, it would seem that Pro is comping 10%. Is that fair? And can talk about the performance of Pro in the first quarter and if you think that impacted the business?\nCraig Menear: Well, we certainly had a strong Pro quarter, and it outpaced the DIY business in total, largely due to the fact that the garden business was obviously down dramatically in the DIY space. But we're very pleased with our Pro, and Bill, if you want to add to that?\nWilliam Lennie: Well, Craig, just kind of a follow-up on engagement. Craig mentioned the tools that we're providing to our account managers in the stores are passes. And as they get more engaged, we are seeing customers expand the number of categories that they purchase. We are seeing them start to utilize more services like delivery, and then as a result, we're seeing accelerated growth in the accounts that are managed by our passes. So great strength in Pro and top performing Pro trades, where our renovator remodeler, our property investors and property managers. So we're pleased with the progress and the trajectory of the business.\nUnidentified Analyst: And as my follow-up, following up on the May commentary, can you talk about what you've seen from the acceleration from Pro versus DIY quarter to date?\nCraig Menear: I mean, we're seeing both in May. The whole store is lifting.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.\nSeth Sigman: Thanks. Hey, guys, good morning. A couple of follow-up questions here. So first, just on the delivery from the store. It's continue to grow at this double-digit rate pretty much since you guys have rolled it out. Can you help us understand how meaningful that is today in terms of the overall contribution? And also, the influence that it may be having in driving higher transaction size, because it does seem to be a big differentiator for you? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: I mean, we're pleased overall with what's happening on the delivery side of that business. We don't break out those numbers specifically. But we are seeing very nice growth. And as Mark said earlier, that is attracting both incremental business with current customers and new customers into the business.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. And then when you look at the online growth this quarter, up 20%, obviously, very strong again. Is it fair to assume there was really little weather impact there? And you discussed a couple of things that may be helping. Any more insight into where the growth is coming from, the types of categories? And also, from a profitability perspective, just the progress that you're making there in improving the margins in that business? Thank you.\nCraig Menear: So let me, I'll answer the second part of that and I'll turn it over to Kevin Hofmann. From a profitability standpoint, we run this on a portfolio basis, and it's an interconnected experience. So in many, many cases, the experience starts in the digital world, it may finish in the physical world. Over 45% of our orders the customer chooses to pick up in one of our stores. So we manage the portfolio, if you will, on a profit basis across the channels.\nKevin Hofmann: Excuse me, just from the health of the online business. So we were really pleased with the traffic growth we saw. Ted mentioned we had double-digit improvement in our conversion rates because of the experiential improvements we've been putting in place. But just super excited some of our fastest-growing sales are what we call those interconnected sales, where the customer is buying online, picking up in store; buying online, shipping to store, and that was some of our fastest growth. And really across the store, flooring did great, plumbing did great, electrical did great. We were very pleased.\nCraig Menear: So there actually is an impact from a seasonal standpoint in the online business, When it's snowing on the ground in April, people aren't really looking online for a patio furniture, for example. So it's kind of funny, but there actually is an impact.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Understood. Thanks very much.\nCraig Menear: You bet.\nOperator: We'll continue on to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning.\nCraig Menear: Morning.\nBrian Nagel: So my first question. Just on the ticket growth. Clearly, a lot of discussion around weather. If you look at the ticket growth, it tracked higher in the quarter and I think went highest rates in a while. What's behind that? And how should we view the sustainability of that metric? And I have a follow-up.\nCraig Menear: I'm assuming you're referring to the $900 and above.\nCarol Tome: Or the average ticket of 5.8.\nCraig Menear: Or the average ticket of 5.8.\nBrian Nagel: Yeah. I was talking more about the number in the press, the average ticket of 5.8. \nCraig Menear: So if you look at the average ticket of 5.8, think about the commodity impact plus the FX impact, and that gets you back to kind of where we've been running all of 2017 quarter-by-quarter.\nBrian Nagel: Okay. So it's \u2013 there hasn't much changes besides those.\nCraig Menear: No, not at all.\nBrian Nagel: Okay. That's helpful. Then the second question I have, I guess, from a bigger picture perspective. We talked a lot about just you mentioned the ongoing strength of the macro environment. Clearly, look at my screen right now, we do have rates rising, albeit on lower \u2013 historically low levels. The question I have is, what do you watch? I mean, why you guys were very good jumper watching a lot of factors out there. What are you watching for maybe some potential, early indications of an impact of higher rates upon your business?\nCarol Tome: Yeah. So there are a number of things that we look at, obviously. During the recovery, we were always looking for green shoots and our looking for red flags, luckily we\u2019re not seeing any of those. But here's what we're looking. As you see, rates are going up, 30-year mortgage, I don't know what your screen is showing. The last time I looked, it was about 4.6%., and it's on its way up projected to be up at least 5% by 2020. Historical mortgages over the past, gosh, 50 some odd years, it's 5.8%. So we're considerably under those historical mortgage rates. But we are super focused on the Affordability Index and what that means in terms of performance by market. So if you look at the Affordability Index for the country at large, it's 152%, which is still very good. The average over again decades is about 127%. So if the Affordability Index were to reach 127% or under, that would certainly be a red flag. And then we look at rising home prices coupled with rising mortgage rates, you see in markets where you might argue there's an overheated housing market or at least certainly one that's on fire, so there anything happening to our business? So I would call out two markets, Denver, Colorado and Seattle, Washington. Both have had seen extraordinary expansion of home price appreciation. The business there is very good, and the reason is because the economy is very good. So you can't just look at housing prices and interest rates and say, 'Oh, oh, you got to then look at what's happening to the economy.' So it's getting a bit more complicated than it has in the past because there are all these influences of business. But certainly, if I stop talking just tell you what we look at every day, we look at ticket and transactions, ticket and transactions. Because if you go back to the last recession, ignoring the housing downturn recession, but the last recession in the United States had 2001, our ticket was flat. So we're looking at that. And then, of course, transaction, because transactions can be an indicator of a few things, right? It could be an indicator of slowdown in demand or an indicator that competitors taking your customer away. So hopefully, that's helpful, Brian.\nBrian Nagel: No, that\u2019s all helpful. I appreciate. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Hi, good morning, guys.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nElizabeth Suzuki: I think you had expected before to experience a similar net sales impact from Harvey and Irma in 2018 as in 2017. Is that still the expectation? And will it benefit be limited to the first half, or could there be some residual benefit in the second half as well?\nCarol Tome: Our expectation is that the sales will be the same year-on-year. The majority of the benefit will occur in the first half. There may be some trailing benefit in the back half because the issues in Puerto Rico are so dramatic, but it won't be material to the company.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Okay. And then shifting over to online, I mean, what are the product categories that are doing well online, and which are more traditionally sold in-store and don't do very well online? And then how frequently are you able to adjust your online pricing to stay competitive?\nCarol Tome: So, first of all, what I'd say is largely, our business online is incremental sales. We're growing the categories in store at the same time that we're growing online. And I'll let Kevin speak to the categories.\nKevin Hofmann: Yeah, as I mentioned, so still strength in our core tools department, our plumbing department, our electrical department. Really, the core of the stores have been performing very nicely. We've got a great bath business online as well. In your question around pricing, it's just like how we think about it in the store of being priced competitively every day and making sure that we differentiate, not just on price, but on the full service offering to the customer, the experience and all the things that we bring to the table. So very actively monitoring and managing the price situation online just like we do in the store.\nCraig Menear: We can move prices, obviously, online instantaneously. We purposely, because of how it impacts the store environment \u2013 prices in the store at a different rate than we do online.\nKevin Hofmann: And I don't want to forget that the interconnected aspect of our online business as well because things like the lumber department pages or building material pages are some of our most active pages because the pros are looking at price and the inventory available. So while they're not transacting as much online in those departments, we have great traffic on those pages.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll continue on to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot, and good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nSeth Basham: Could you guys give us some color on the comp or the growth in comp transactions by ticket size?\nCarol Tome: Yes, we talked about big ticket already. Our inspector wanting to know what happened with the smaller ticket? \nSeth Basham: Correct.\nCarol Tome: Yes. So as you would anticipate, for transactions with tickets of $50 or less, they were down year-on-year. That was because of our garden business. And I can make this really real for you. If you can think about penetration of tender and you may say why? If you look at penetration of tender in the quarter, our private label credit card penetration increased by 50 basis points. At the same time, our cash tender decreased by 50 basis points. And that was all related to our garden business, which is a smaller ticket activity.\nSeth Basham: Fair enough. If you think about the transaction growth overall ex-garden, how positive was it? And how does that compare to recent quarterly trends?\nCarol Tome: It was a positive 1.1% for the quarter and continues to be positive. As we said, May comps for the company are double-digit positive.\nSeth Basham: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now hear from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. First question just had to do with the pilot program on the delivery from car and van. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit there what you're seeing from that uptake and particularly at big category or customer level? Are you seeing Pro versus DIY being more heavy with that uptake?\nCraig Menear: It's still early days, and customers are choosing to purchase all sorts of things. It could be a Pro on a jobsite leading something. But there's a lot also on the Buy Online, Deliver From Store front. So it's interesting to see where it goes. It's not taking a real pattern at this point.\nDennis McGill: Okay. Great. And then Carol, can you elaborate. On the transportation costs increase that you experienced in the quarter the deleverage there. Is that fuel alone? Are you seeing any issue with availability? And where do you see that trending for the year within guidance?\nCarol Tome: No, it wasn't fuel alone. We had eight basis points of gross margin contraction in transportation, of which three basis points was fuel and five basis points was the pressure in transportation. We're not alone. All companies are facing higher transportation cost. And as you know, as our practice, we will figure out a way to work through this, but we certainly got some challenges ahead.\nDennis McGill: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dan Binder with Jefferies.\nDan Binder: Hi. It's Dan Binder. Thank you. Carol, you mentioned a margin mix impact on gross margin. Was that primarily from the seasonal mix? And how should we think about that for Q2? And then my second question was around credit. And just curious if you can get your thoughts on demand for credit, use of the credit lines that are out there, average spending on credit and delinquencies?\nCarol Tome: Yeah. So, on the margin expansion that came from mix and acquisitions that was 14 basis points in total, of which six basis points was mix and eight basis points came from our recent acquisitions, those acquisitions being the Company store and Compact Power. As we look to the second quarter, obviously with an increasing penetration of the garden business, which is a lower margin category, that's an impact on gross margin. But we're going to have benefit in other areas, too. So nothing comes to our attention that we can't deliver the gross margin guidance that we just provided and updated with you today. On our private label credit card, really pleased with the performance. As I mentioned, we saw 50 basis point improvement in penetration year-on-year. What we're seeing is a very healthy portfolio. The average net receivable, which obviously isn't \u2013 underwritten by us, it's underwritten by a third-party, but it's over $12 billion. We had 1 million new accounts opened year-on-year and we're seeing pretty good utilization on those accounts. For the consumer, the utilization is around 29%. For the Pro, the utilization is around 23%. And our approval rates are north of 70% for both the consumer and the Pro. Part of the change in accounting for us is moving all of the aspects of our private label credit card up to the revenue line. And included in the benefit that we removed out of our selling expenses and moved up to the revenue line was gain share. Gain share is our profit-sharing program with Citi who underwrites this card for us. The way the portfolio has gains is there's an EBIT threshold that must earn and anything over that a bit threshold, we share in it. And that percentage of sharing changes over time. Embedded in that EBIT threshold, of course, is that you've got to make sure that the portfolio doesn't have high losses because that could impact your gain share and our losses. This is a long winded answer to your question. But our losses are running at or below historical averages. So the portfolio is very healthy.\nDan Binder: Great color, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Hi, thanks, good morning. Just on the gross margin line just follow-up on the transportation costs, just wondering if you could characterize how they came in relative to your original expectations? And then I have a follow-up.\nCarol Tome: We didn't anticipate deleveraging the supply chain in the first quarter to the extent that we did. The team did an awesome job. They were managing the demand pressure coming from all kinds of areas, so managed through it.\nChuck Grom: Okay. So you would expect that headwind to continue moving up heavily?\nCarol Tome: There is definitely pressure coming out of the back -- balance of the year, but will manage through it.\nChuck Grom: Okay. And then just on the weather here, obviously you guys have a lot of experience dealing with it. When you think about it, does the business get simply delayed here and you recover most of it? Or do you loose some of it because the window just simply closes.\nCraig Menear: No, we\u2019ll actually recover most of the business there. There may be a piece here and there that you missed like part of pre-emergence, but even in that we feel like we're getting most of that business right now particularly in the north. So the majority of this business will be recovered.\nChuck Grom: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We'll continue on to Matt McClintock with Barclays.\nMatt McClintock: Hi, guys. Good morning everyone, McLintock. Carol, I was wondering if we take the housing question from more of a generational perspective. It seems like a lot of the long-term optimism for the housing market to stay strong is driven by the millennial generation forming households. But can you talk about maybe trend changes that you're seeing in the other generations. And I only ask because it seems like a lot of the story of baby boomers maybe moving downsizing their household seems to be kind of minimizing? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: Well as we look at mobility rates, we see mobility rates declining by all age cohorts, particularly baby boomers like me and there's been some great research that came out of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies that suggest the desire is to age out in your home. Think about what that means for home improvement. There's nothing but opportunity. That's just one trend.\nMatt McClintock: Can you can you maybe dig into some of how the opportunities do change for you and how you position yourself for some of those changes just a little bit more.\nCarol Tome: Well yeah, I mean if you think about flooring for example, that's something that people look at as they age in their home. How do you make sure you eliminate trip hazards? You think about the back three models and the ability to put in walk-in showers for example, so that you don't have to step into a bathtub or you have the potential to slip. You think about lighting around the home becomes an important factor both inside and outside of the home. You think about security, so there's lots of factors that go into how somebody thinks about changing their home if there aging out in their home.\nMatt McClintock: Perfect, thank you very much for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Benedict with Baird.\nPeter Benedict: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question and appreciate in the Stamford, Connecticut store. \nCarol Tome: It's $1 million in the first week. It\u2019s an awesome store.\nPeter Benedict: There you go, well done. Given the traction online with categories like tools, electrical, bath, can you remind us how you're rethinking the space allocation within the stores to take advantage of the opportunities across different categories? That's my first question.\nCraig Menear: Sure. I think as I mentioned earlier, our online business for all practical purposes is incremental, so we actually haven't seen in the need to make a lot of shifts in space. It's something that we look at on a continual basis. But we really haven't had to do that at all.\nMark Holifield: No, I'd say, Craig, the space that we're doing speaks more than the interconnected nature of our online business where we're putting lockers in the front of our stores we will do about 1000 lockers of this year and we're also adding some bigger holding area for bulkier items near the front of the store. So space allocation is more for online pickup than any merchandising changes in the bay.\nCarol Tome: 46% of our online orders are picked up in the store in the first quarter.\nPeter Benedict: Okay. That's terrific. It makes sense. And then Carol back to kind of the red flag you're keeping an eye on out there, how about -- what are you watching when you think about the leverage guardware for the business interest rates are going up here. But I mean, is there a level or a point at which the 2.0 become something that you're not comfortable with? Or how should we think about that?\nCarol Tome: Well, I'm really pleased with how we've managed our capital structure over the past several years. If you look at our the amount of debt that we have outstanding, long-term debt, excluding current maturities, $24 billion. The average maturity of that debt is 13.6 years. The coupon is 3.7%. The latter maturity full of 40 years. So we really worked hard to not put any financial risk into the company. And with an adjusted debt, that are target of two times. That implies we can get the debt paid off in a very short period of time. So comfortable with that leverage. Always going to be mindful of not putting the company into financial distress, but we're comfortable with where we're today.\nPeter Benedict: Okay. Sounds good. thank you very much guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Baugh with Stifel.\nJohn Baugh: Thank you. Good morning. Just quickly you said you're hype are focused on the transactions and thanks for the 1.1 number in April X garden. I know you don't guide to that figure. But it sounds like May is well up. You've been running a 2-plus percent I believe fairly consistently. Is there any thought around that number for the year in light of the start to the first quarter? Thank you.\nCraig Menear: So the 1.1 was for the quarter X our garden business. It wasn't for April. So that was for the total quarter. And we think about the balance between ticket and transactions have been relatively even over time and that's how we plan the year.\nJohn Baugh: Great. Thank you. Good luck.\nOperator: Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs has our next question.\nMatt Fassler: Thanks, so much, and good morning. My first question is for Carol. You spelled out a 56 basis point impact on the expense ratio from your investment plan. Can you spell out here at the outset of that program where some of that money went and whether that's the kind of impact you would expect to see us through the year or whether there's a better top line that impact should dissipate a bit?\nCarol Tome: Sure. So I talked about expense deleverage and leverage as a percent of sales. I didn't really talk about the expense growth factor. But let's use that nomenclature because that's how we've guided for the year. So the expense growth factor in the first quarter was 202% and the drivers of that were rev rack, which was 57%; investments in the business, 70%; and then what we call BAU, business as usual, 75%. And that business as usual, there's about 12% of acquisition-related expenses, companies that we've acquired. So we focus \u2013 then on the guidance that we gave for the year, clearly, it's going to get better. And it's going to get better for a couple of reasons. First, we have $167 million of hurricane-related expenses in the back half that will not repeat. So you should model higher expense growth factor in the first half than in the back half. Secondly, you've heard and we talk about this, we have a new labor model, which more effectively allocates our hours to our activity. That starts to kick in into June. So we should be driving more labor productivity than we saw in the first quarter. Then if I focus simply on the investments in the first quarter, the dollar amount of investments, and I'm not going to call this out every quarter, but because we\u2019re just getting into this, I'll give you this color. Thee dollar amount of the investments were $144 million in the quarter. And those dollars were used for increased wages for our people, for increased advertising as we move to a more marketing technology platform; increases in display cost. You heard Craig call out what we're doing the sides of the stores. And then increase in headcount. We've got to have some people on Board to help us do all of these investing. In fact, I believe we've hired 350 people alone in our IT organization. So these are investments that we're making to reach those sales and operating margin targets that we laid out for 2020.\nMatt Fassler: That is great detail. If I could follow-up on a couple of disclosures you made on the monthly trends. Was there any weather impact on the first two months of the quarter on February and March? And then, when you think about the bathtub effect, is April was really the only month that was impacted. You tend to recapture most of those lost sales in the month of May? Or does the bathtub effect push out towards June and July?\nCraig Menear: Yes. So there definitely was impact still in the other months as well. And the recovery of that, you'll get a significant piece in May, but it will actually flow into June and July as well.\nMatt Fassler: That's great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nScot Ciccarelli: So are you seeing a greater appetite for jobsite delivery from your Pro customers?\nCraig Menear: Certainly.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. So obviously, that is the case. Now over time, do you think that happens to change your historical real estate advantage that you've had against some of your major competitors or maybe even open the door to higher levels of e-commerce competition because then the physical location or physical structure of The Home Depot store maybe gets partly marginalized over time?\nCraig Menear: Actually, when you think about our location and footprint, we'll actually leverage that as an advantage overall to our business, where we are well-positioned across markets, including urban markets and sit within 10 miles and 90% of the U.S. population. So no, we actually see this as an advantage. And Mark?\nMark Holifield: Yeah, I mean, you'll recall from the investor conference, we outlined 40 flatbed distribution centers, and we expect to open those to take some pressure off of the stores. But our stores are going to be in the delivery business in smaller markets for a good long time. They're still ideally located and a great place to originate of those deliveries from. In urban markets, those flatbed distribution centers will take a lot of pressure off of those Hardlines stores.\nCraig Menear: I think the other thing you have to think about is actually, not just the downstream portion of our supply chain network, but the advantage that we actually have as a result of the upstream portion of our supply chain moving goods from our suppliers to our stores and our distribution centers. It's those things working in combination that will create the fastest most efficient delivery in home-improvement.\nMark Holifield: And Katherine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question this morning is from Alvaro Lacayo will call you with Gabelli & Company. \nAlvaro Lacayo: Thank you. It's Alavro Lacayo here. Just one question on update on the capital allocation, Carol, last call, you said you were going to provide us with an update later on given that cash flow from operation was going to be a little bit higher than where we sort of guided dividend and should repurchases and just some commentary around there's any updated thoughts there?\nCarol Tome: Yeah. So we've been working on how to best use the cash this coming off the business through lower taxes. We aren't announcing anything today. We have a Board meeting this week. So we will keep you apprised, expect a more thorough update at the end of the second quarter. But with that, let me just say that our principles aren\u2019t changing. The first use of cash is to go back and support of the business and our strategic imperatives. The second is to pay our dividend, and anything that's left over goes to share repurchases.\nAlvaro Lacayo: Great. Thank you very much.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: And I'll turn the floor back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on the second quarter earnings call in August.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today's conference.

Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2019 was another record year for our business, as we achieved the highest sales in company history. Excluding the extra week in 2018, fiscal 2019 sales grew 3.5% to $110.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $10.25. As expected, we finished the year with our strongest comp performance in the fourth quarter. Comp sales were up 5.2% from last year and our U.S. comps were positive 5.3%. Sales for the fourth quarter were $25.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $2.28. We saw broad based growth across all geographies and merchandising departments in the quarter. All 19 of our U.S. regions posted positive comps and internationally both Canada and Mexico reported positive comps in the fourth quarter. As Ted will detail, both comp ticket and transactions grew in the core and we saw growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. We have strong holiday season with record setting sales on Black Friday and during Cyber Week. These results reflect solid execution by our stores, our merchants, our supply chain teams, as well as our vendor partners and demonstrate the overall health of the consumer. I am proud of our results in fiscal 2019 is the team successfully navigated a number of external headwinds by maintaining a relentless focus on our customer. 2019 was also a pivotal year in our transformation to create the One Home Depot experience. We are now two years into our multiyear investment and are realizing benefits. We have more conviction than ever that these strategic initiatives are creating a value proposition that is unique to the marketplace and will extend our leadership position for years to come. The majority of our U.S. stores have a new look and feel, and we address customer pinpoints around navigation and checkout. Our enhanced signage and store refresh package, along with investments in the front-end of our stores have improved the customer experience and driven associate productivity. These store investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, which we believe is translating into market share gains. As a compliment to our store investments, we\u2019re investing to strengthen the competitive advantages that we have built through the blending of our physical and digital platforms into a more seamless interconnected experience. For example, our chain wide rollout of digital appliance labels connecting ratings from the digital world to the physical world, enhancing the in-store shopping experience. Additionally, homedepot.com continues to be an engine for growth for our overall business, driving increased traffic online and additional footsteps to our stores, because of this, we continue to invest in search functionality, category presentations, product content and enhance fulfillment options to remove friction from the online shopping experience. Excluding the extra week last year, online sales grew 20.8% in the quarter, and 21.4% for the year, and over 50% of the time, our customers choose to pick up their order in a store. This is the power of the interconnected retail strategy. We\u2019ve also expanded our digital capabilities by investing in B2B website experience tailored specifically for the needs of our Pro customers. We have now onboarded over 1 million Pro customers. Additionally, during the quarter, we completed the integration of our third party best-in-class CRM system for all of our Pro sales and services teams. This enhances our visibility, enabling us to better serve our customers. I\u2019m excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to build capabilities to engage with a Pro, no matter when, where or how they want to interact. Another key component of the best-in-class interconnected shopping experience centers on enhanced delivery and fulfillment options. In 2019, we continued our multiyear journey to create the fastest, most efficient delivery network in home improvement. We are now live with at least one of each type of facility that we\u2019re building. So it is early days, we\u2019re pleased with the initial results. For example, we have opened a dozen Market Delivery Operations or MDOs that have enabled us to transition 20% of our clients\u2019 deliveries from an outsourced model to one in which we control more of the customer experience. This is translated to meaningful improvements in our customer satisfaction scores for appliance deliveries. Our supply chain build-out will continue to ramp from here with the largest number of new facilities coming online in 2021 and 2022. Turning to 2020, Richard will take you to the details, but we expect another year of growth, with both sales and top growth ranging from approximately 3.5% to 4%, and diluted earnings per share of approximately $10.45. Today, our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the progress our teams made as we transform ourselves into the One Home Depot the future. While we define our sales growth in percentage terms, we capture share in dollar terms and to the second year of One Home Depot investment program, we have grown sales by over $9 billion, the level of growth unmatched in our market. As we look forward to 2020, I am more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead. We\u2019re investing to unlock the power of a truly interconnected customer experience by enhancing our already strong foundation to further extend our leadership position into the marketplace. As with any transformation, the work we\u2019re doing is complex and I\u2019m proud of the way our associates continue to execute at higher levels and focus on what\u2019s most important in our business, our customers. I want to close by thanking our associates for the hard work and dedication in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. For the second half of the year, 100% of our stores will receive success sharing, our bonus program for our associates. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2020. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone. We had a strong finish to the year with fourth quarter sales exceeding our expectations. We saw growth across historical Pro and DIY customers. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, but by our clients department, which posted double-digit comps in the quarter, constant decor and storage and tools were also above the company average. All other merchandising departments were positive but below the company top of 5.2%. In the fourth quarter, comp average ticket increased 4.4% and comps transactions increased 0.8%. The strength in our comp was partially driven by a shift in our event timing, which Richard will talk through in a moment. In addition, we had an excellent response to our Black Friday and Holiday events and our customers continue to trade up to new and innovative items. After experiencing significant deflation in lumber and copper during the first three quarters of 2019, commodity prices had a more neutral impact in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, big ticket concurrence actions those over $1,000, which represent approximately 20% of US sales were up double digits. The strength in our big ticket sales was driven in part by the shift in our event timing, as well as strong performance in number of other big ticket categories. During the fourth quarter big ticket categories like appliances, vinyl plank flooring, and our installation services business all posted costs above the company average. Consumer demand is strong and this was evident during our annual Black Friday gift centre and decorative holiday events. The partnership and collaboration between our merchants and supplier partners help bring a fantastic lineup of great deals in special box categories like smartphone power tools, hand tools and decorative holiday. Our unique assortment, together with excellent customer service and execution led to incredible results. Black Friday was a record sales day for our company and our gift centre event grew double digits versus last year. We also saw our customers tackle a variety of projects around the house. During the fourth quarter we saw comps above the company average in several kitchen and bath categories, special or window coverings, cleaning and exterior paint. We also saw significant growth in our online only home decor categories, which we call HD Home as we build awareness from these high quality style forward assortments. Sales for our Pro customers were healthy, driven by strength and categories like pneumatics, concrete, hand tools, and COGS all of which grew faster than the company average. Looking back at 2019, our team continued their unwavering commitment to serve our customers with great everyday values and innovative product and we did this while investing in a customer back store interconnected experience to ensure that we continue to be the product authority and home improvement for years to come. At our Investors Conference back in December, we talked about investments we were making across our business. We also shared our new ad campaign and tagline, How Doers Get More Done that we launched to highlight our investments into these new experiences and capabilities. We believe that it\u2019s important to signal to our customers that the Home Depot is evolving as their needs change. But it\u2019s still early in our campaign, we see customers responding to our enhanced capabilities, giving us credit for saving them time and helping them complete their projects. In response to our campaign, we saw one of our largest single days of downloads of our award winning mobile app and double-digit growth in usage of mobile tools like product locator and image search. As we look forward to 2020, we will continue our investments to better meet our customers\u2019 needs and drive a great shopping experience. One of the investments you\u2019ll see in the first half of the year is a reset to our outdoor power equipment base. We know the marketplace for outdoor power tools is transitioned to cordless technology and we\u2019ve learned in our tools department that once a customer adopts a battery platform, they see tremendous value in sticking with that platform. Similar to what we\u2019ve done in our tools department, we\u2019re in the process of resetting our outdoor powerful equipment phase to showcase our assortment by brand highlighting EGO, Toro, Milwaukee, Ryobi, Dewalt and Makita, many of which can only be found at the Home Depot. To this new presentation, customers can clearly see and easily shop the value proposition that these cordless platforms bring including being more environmentally friendly, safer and easier to use, all with the power and runtime to get the job done. These powerful brands now have the lion\u2019s share of batteries in the marketplace with hundreds of millions of batteries and customers homes and job sites today. We currently offer over 1000 cordless power tools, and that number will continue to grow as our supplier partners are introducing innovative product all the time. Our comprehensive and unique assortment of outdoor power equipment resulted in double-digit comps in fiscal 2019. The spring right around the corner, we are gearing up for another busy season. Our stores are stocked with new and innovative products and we just recently announced we are hiring 80,000 new associates to help us serve our customers during our spring selling season. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Richard\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, let me take a quick moment to remind everyone that fiscal 2019 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal \u201818 consisted of 53 weeks. This extra week added approximately $1.7 billion in sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. When we report our comparable sales or comps, we report them on a 52-week to 52-week basis by comparing weeks one-week through 52-week of fiscal 2019, with weeks two through 53 weeks of fiscal 2018 In the fourth quarter of 2019, total sales were $25.8 billion, a 2.7% decrease from last year, reflecting the compared against the extra week in 2018. Our total company comp sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.2% and comps in the U.S. increased 5.3%. Because of last year\u2019s 53rd week and the resulting calendar shift, our monthly comps are distorted due to the timing of our annual Black Friday and Cyber Monday events this year versus last year. Our reported monthly comps for the total company were positive 1.2% in November, 9.9% in December and 5.7% in January. Our monthly comps in the U.S. were positive 1.1% in November, 10.4% in December and 5.8% in January. Given the distortion in our monthly comps caused by the calendar shift, we believe that it is more appropriate to look at November and December on a combined basis. For the combined two months of November and December, our total company comp was 5% followed by 5.7% in January. For the year, our sales total record $110.2 billion. If we exclude the sales from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018, we grew sales by approximately $3.7 billion in fiscal 2019, a level of growth unmatched in our market. For the year, total company comp sales increased 3.5% and U.S. comp sales increased 3.8%. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. Similar to last quarter, the change in our gross margin was primarily driven by higher shrink and a mix of products sold compared to last year. For the year, our gross margin was 34.1% slightly higher than our guidance at the beginning of the year. In the fourth quarter operating expense as a percent sales decreased by 64 basis points to 20.7%, slightly better than our plan. During the quarter, we saw approximately 77 basis points of leverage, as we lapped the fiscal 2018 impairment of certain trade names and the 53rd week last year. This leverage was partially offset by expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, which increased approximately $25 million from last year and cost 12 basis points of the average. Fiscal 2019 operating expense as a percent of sales was 19.7%, a decrease of 28 basis points from last year. Our fiscal 2019 expense performance was better than our initial expectations, driven by productivity initiatives in our core business. During the year, we spent approximately $1 billion of investment expenses related to our strategic initiatives in line with our plan. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 13.2% and for the year was approximately 14.4%. Interest and other expenses for the fourth quarter grew by $27 million to $292 million due primarily the higher long-term debt levels than one year ago. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 20.3% and from fiscal 2019 was 23.6%. The lower than expected effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2019, was driven primarily by several discrete tax items. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.28, an increase of 9.1% from last year. For fiscal 2019, diluted earnings per share were $10.25, an increase of 5.3% compared to fiscal 2018. Moving on to some additional highlights, we ended the year with a store count of 2291, while retail selling square footage was approximately 238 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per retail square foot were $455, the highest in our company\u2019s history. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories grew $606 million to $14.5 billion and inventory terms were 4.9 times, down slightly versus last year. The growth in our inventory versus last year reflects the investments we\u2019re making to accelerate merchandising resets and higher in stock levels than we had one year ago. Moving on to capital allocation. In fiscal 2019, we generated approximately $13.7 billion of cash from operations and use that cash, as well as the proceeds from $2.4 billion of net debt issuances to invest in our business, pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase our shares. During the year, we invested approximately $2.7 billion back into the business through capital expenditures. Further, we paid $6 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Finally, during the year, we repurchased approximately $7 billion or about 32.8 million of our outstanding shares, including roughly $3.25 billion or 14.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. Completed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.4%, 60 basis points higher than the end of fiscal 2018. Today\u2019s press release includes our guidance for fiscal 2020 and I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we got off of GAAP, so fiscal 2012 guidance will watch from our reported results for fiscal 2019. At our Investor Conference in December of 2019, we shared with you some preliminary thoughts for 2020 and we\u2019re reiterating that guidance today. The economy is strong and the U.S. consumer is healthy. The foundation of our sales plan starts with GDP and our 2020 sales guidance as soon as U.S. GDP growth of slightly less than 2% in 2020. The GDP, we add the impact that we think we will see from the housing environment, including demand driven by home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the age of the housing stock. As we look at these metrics, we see an environment that is healthy and stable. Our 2020 self guidance also assumes that we will continue to gain share in the marketplace. For fiscal 2020, we expect both sales growth and total company costs sales growth of approximately 3.5% to 4%. Fiscal 2020 represents the peak year of our investment program, and as a result, we expect our fiscal 2020 operating expenses to grow at 1.2 times the rate of our expected sales growth. For the year, we expect to grow operating profit dollars to $16 billion, giving us an operating margin of approximately 14%. For fiscal 2020, we assume our effective tax rate will be approximately 24%. We expect fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 2% to $10.45. For the year, we project cash flow from operations of approximately $13.5 billion. We plan to invest $2.8 billion of this cash back into the business in the form of capital expenditures. We also plan to use this cash to pay $6.4 billion in dividends and repurchase at least $5 billion of outstanding shares. Before I close, I would like to update you on how we\u2019re thinking about one of our capital allocation principles. With regards to our dividends in lieu of using a 55% payout ratio, we will look to grow our dividends every year as we grow earnings as we have for the last 11 years. This morning, we announced that our Board increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share. With that, I want to thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It\u2019s on any\u2026\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. It\u2019s on any potential supply disruption coming out of Asia. What have you factored in? What\u2019s the current status of your supply chain? Have you seen any issues with getting product from Asia at this point? And if this extends for a meaningful period of time, what -- how do you size the potential impact to your sales and earnings over the next few quarters?\nCraig Menear: So, Michael, let me -- I\u2019ll start off and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Mark Holifield. First of all, the guidance that we\u2019ve provided, obviously, does not include any guidance update for the situation. It\u2019s a very fluid situation that we\u2019re monitoring closely. And all of our goods for Q1 are essentially onshore or on their way. So we feel pretty good about that situation. And Mark, do you might want to provide an update on...\nMark Holifield: Yeah. Sure, Craig. Yeah. As you mentioned, it does change every day. Our Q1 merchandise is already here or on the way and Q2 the picture is still developing there. For our direct import, our sourcing offices in Asia are in touch with our top factories as they are returning to operations. For our domestic vendors, we\u2019re working with them to understand and mitigate any potential impacts in their supply chains. Our teams working with all of our suppliers, both domestic and import, and our logistics service providers on a PO-by-PO, container by container basis to understand what the impacts of our product flow are and they\u2019re taking appropriate action. We are encouraged that we\u2019re seeing factories come back to work. Provinces coming back to work in China, but it is a fluid situation and highly variable in terms of what\u2019s the current state?\nMichael Lasser: And just to clarify, based on what you know today, do you think that there will be an earnings hit over the next couple of quarters based on any supply disruptions if this -- even if things get back to normal in the very near future so or do you have time to adjust based on what you know at this point?\nCraig Menear: Michael based on what we know today, we couldn\u2019t say that there would be a hit. Again, the teams are working this day-to-day, as Mark said to the PO-to-PO, container-to-container. We\u2019re also putting plans in place and mitigate any risk going forward.\nMichael Lasser: That\u2019s what going in there\u2026\nCraig Menear: 70% of what we do is domestic.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. Thanks. My follow question is you just wrapped up your second year in a row with about 1% growth comp growth in traffic after many years of higher traffic than that. Is 1% growth in traffic the new norm and how do you think the implementation of your strategic investment plan is going to impact traffic in the next few years?\nCraig Menear: The objective of what we\u2019re doing on the investments plan is to position ourselves to be able to continue to grow faster than the market. I think, some of the growth that we saw in years past was a result of an accelerated recovery from a very difficult spot. What we\u2019ve always focused on is how do we balance ticket and transactions, and that\u2019s really where our focus is and the market will determine what level is that.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. Thank you very much, and good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. I actually had a follow-up on Michael\u2019s question first, like, I guess, the question is, given the delta that we\u2019ve seen in transactions and average ticket. What would you guys point to regarding kind of what\u2019s driving that divergence, I mean, and you just referenced you had a recovery phase, but I would think that recovery phase actually would, help both sides of that ledger, not just one.\nRichard McPhail: Yes. So, I\u2019d say we have some opportunity areas that we\u2019ve invested in to continue to grow that is accelerated our ticket growth largely being we put significant investment in appliances, that has paid back in a in a very big way in terms of the accelerated growth we\u2019ve seen in that business. Same thing would hold true for what Ted referenced as it relates to the lithium technology and the average ticket growth, we\u2019ve seen power tools and now in outdoor power equipment. So I think there is some innovation and investment factors that have helped drive ticket maybe even above and beyond as we took share in those categories. But we look pretty pleased with the consistency of our traffic growth over time. And like, I said, we\u2019ll work to balance traffic and ticket we always want to make sure there\u2019s a reasonable balance there.\nScot Ciccarelli: So when you think about -- I\u2019m sorry, go ahead?\nTed Decker: I was just going to add, Scott, I\u2019ll add to that Q4, very much event driven or gift center, decorative holiday, and as Craig said, appliances and those all performed incredibly well. So that contributes to the ticket and as we see consumers continue to trade up to the new innovative product that we\u2019re offering. And while we\u2019re happy with transactions, they were a little bit depressed with the lack of cold weather. So if you think during a winter you get a lot of people stopping in for ice melt for that that smaller pickup even car washer fluid, et cetera, and with the more mild winter a lot of the biggest suppression there of transactions were those quick cold weather pick up items?\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess when you think about all the investments you guys have been making in the business and supply chain technology, should we continue expect kind of the pattern that we\u2019ve seen here continue or is it have a more balanced impact as we go forward? Thanks\nCraig Menear: Yeah. I think, again, we look for kind of balance in that will be perfect one way or another no, but we would look for balance.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning. Long-term question first, so thinking again about the payback from investments, it sounds like we\u2019ll see some costs moderate next year, so that\u2019ll be good to margin. But in terms of the topline lift and I realize you\u2019re probably not going to quantify much. But can you tell us where the places will start to see better comps? Is it the Pro-wallet share, is it MRO categories, DIY? So what are the -- some of the KPIs that won\u2019t be as apparent as comps that you\u2019re seeing that that tells you that some of these investments are beginning to pay off?\nCraig Menear: First of all, our investments are targeted for all the above that you just rolled out, probably, we think MRO you think consumer, our intent is to grow in all of those spaces. And but what we\u2019re really trying to set ourselves up to do in the investment is to be able to position Home Depot to grow faster than the market growth on a consistent basis no matter what that environment is. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to get done.\nSimeon Gutman: And does that require waiting for the supply chain investment to finish rolling out or no that should stagger as all these other investments are taking place?\nCraig Menear: I mean, the supply chain is a part of the overall component. As we\u2019ve shared with you, we have investments that span across our business, whether that\u2019s an investment in the store, whether that\u2019s investments in the digital world, in our marketing elements and our product development, as well as the supply chain. And we\u2019ll see the -- as we put more and more of these capabilities in place as a supply chain continues to expand. As we open more facilities in \u201821 and \u201822, the bulk of those we\u2019ll see that continue to grow as you put more capabilities against market.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then my follow up is in the fourth quarter, it looks like the business performed a little better than planned. Can you parse out underlying housing, signs and it may be improving versus some of the seasonal, it sounds like December was a big month, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s more holiday, but at the same time, you didn\u2019t have as much weather impact. So if you can just talk about underlying housing versus other drivers?\nRichard McPhail: Sure. Simeon, this is Richard. So from a housing perspective, all housing indicators wind up really sort of where we expected them. And so we don\u2019t think that that had any material impact on our business. You mentioned December, there\u2019s a little bit of a timing shift there in the calendar from November to December. But, overall, it was really the strong execution across the quarter and Ted maybe you want to go a little bit more into the strength of the quarter.\nTed Decker: Yeah. I think, as I said in my comments, we like the balance of ticket and transaction, we certainly like the balance of consumer in Pro and our Pro was strong in Q4, but we really saw the engaged consumer in -- whether more discretionary categories and terrific artificial Christmas tree business, our gift center record sales and growth and our gift center and appliances, as I said, double-digit comps in appliances, it\u2019s not always just a refrigerator that\u2019s broken being replaced, it\u2019s increasingly discretionary purchases. So we just saw a very strong consumer.\nSimeon Gutman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Yeah. Thanks. Nice quarter. And normalizing for the event shifts sales are pretty consistent across the quarter. I\u2019m just wondering how we think about the cadence of comps by quarter in 2020 and I\u2019m wondering if you could offer some thoughts on how February started out?\nCraig Menear: Well, thank you, Chuck. So we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, but we would say that 2020 we will see are relatively evenly spread across the two half of the year with respect to the comp sales. And with respect to what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020, our guidance is based on the best information we have of the moment and so our results today are consistent with that guidance.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Great. And then just bigger picture is one of you guys could just amplify on the opportunity that you have with the Pro, as you onboard more of them onto the B2B website, particularly now that there\u2019s going to be the CRM aspect included? Thanks.\nTed Decker: Yeah. I think when we think about the Pro customer, we\u2019re actually building an ecosystem for our Pro customer that encompasses product and brands and delivery and credit services and our digital capabilities would B2B tool rental and a whole lot more. Obviously, all of that coming together allows us to be able to service our Pro customers in a more holistic way and it allows us to continue to grow with larger more complex customers. And so, when we look at the Pro business and we think we\u2019re in 15% to 17% range, and we\u2019d love to see that the much more in line with consumer penetration of share that we have as we go forward, which is why we\u2019re making these investments.\nChuck Grom: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So one to a couple follow up. So first on this seasonal business and the impact of the weather, overall, how would you assess the weather impact last year in December is really wet. I think you called out 85 basis points of headwind a year ago, you also had warm weather in January against Polar Vortex at the end there last year, but at the same time, you didn\u2019t get the snow melt and the snow blower. So how would you assess your overall impact of weather?\nTed Decker: Chris, this is Ted. I\u2019d say neutral. It\u2019s just, as you said, extended season in some markets, the grounds not freezing, et cetera, that Pros could stay at work. But then on the other hand, you didn\u2019t get all your cold weather categories, so our merchants in shore and snow and ice melt business aren\u2019t as happy as some of our other merchants. But I would say on balance a little impact neutral?\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then on the gross margin, so sequentially, the performance was better relative to the third quarter. You mentioned shrink and mix were still headwinds. And that, obviously, you talked about the Analyst Day they persisted into \u201820. But it did get a little bit better, what was the -- what shifted in the sense there and help offset that or did one of those factors mitigate, and does it change your view as you think about 2020?\nCraig Menear: Shrink was consistent with what we have observed through the year and we are taking steps to address that in 2020 as we discussed. We had some great benefit as we\u2019ve had all year from some of the supply chain investments we\u2019re making and productivity supply chain, but shrink was consistent.\nChristopher Horvers: And so the delta versus last quarter, anything to call out there?\nCraig Menear: It\u2019s really -- it\u2019s a consistent trend, and as I said, we\u2019re looking to address it started 2020.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Thanks so much. Have a great spring\nCraig Menear: Thanks.\nTed Decker: Thanks Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Michael Baker with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Baker: Hi. Thanks. A couple here. So one, the comp outlook for next year, 3.5 to 4. This year your comp at 3.5, but you were hurt by least 50 basis points from lumber. So essentially you got into a slow down next year and in fact the slowest comp in a number of years, when you adjust for inflation, yet housing seems to be getting better. So just curious disconnect there. Is it just sort of setting up for some potential upside?\nCraig Menear: I mean like -- our methodology that we use, hasn\u2019t changed and it\u2019s not a perfect model. But Richard, do you want to just walk through this?\nRichard McPhail: Yeah. Sure. We stay consistent with our methodology providing sales guidance and if you look at the elements of that methodology from GDP assumptions to what we\u2019re thinking with respect to support from housing to the expectation that we will continue to take share. None of the assumptions behind those elements has changed significantly since December and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re reconfirming that outlet.\nCraig Menear: And I -- one comment, I guess, people have always tried to think about our business as it relates to interest rates, just so we have never been able to correlate sales to interest rates. So that doesn\u2019t come into our thinking as a result.\nMichael Baker: But I guess a follow-up on that. You would think that your business correlates to housing, right, which I guess in turn correlates with interest rates. Is that a fair statement?\nCraig Menear: It\u2019s a fair statement. We -- and certainly, we\u2019ve seen some of the indicators in very recent in the very recent time period, pick up a bit, but we\u2019re not going to adjust guidance based on short-term fluctuations or observations in housing. We think housing is healthy and stable. It\u2019s going to continue to provide positive support for business.\nMichael Baker: Okay. That makes sense. If I can follow up, as I recall, the third quarter was hurt a little bit by the timing of Black Friday. So presumably that helped the fourth quarter, I get the shift in the month within the quarter, but third quarter versus fourth quarter, did that help fourth quarter at all, and if so by how much?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. It was it was roughly a 35 basis points shift those ways, so it hurt Q3 about 35, it shifted that to Q4 by 35.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thank you. If I could slide in one more, you didn\u2019t -- you said you don\u2019t change your methodology and how you comp, but you are changing the methodology on the dividend, just wondering why you\u2019re changing that is just a new CFO and a different way to think about it or do something, some other reason we should think about.\nRichard McPhail: No. Look, we are maintaining our policy of wanting to increase our dividend every year as we grow earnings. We\u2019re not going to tie to a specific payout ratio. But I think that this year\u2019s increase of 10% is a great example of our intention to continue increase the dividend and also reflection of our confidence in business.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Make sense. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks. Actually just follow-up on that comment on the dividend, so is there a specific relationship we should think about as it relates to EPS growth versus dividend growth, because obviously, as you said, a 10% increases very impressive, given that in 2020, you\u2019re kind of only looking for call it a 2% increase in earnings and presumably earnings growth will accelerate in \u201821?\nTed Decker: Look, our general philosophy around capital allocation hasn\u2019t changed at all in terms of, first and foremost, we\u2019re going to invest what we need to enter the business to continue to position this business to win for the long-term. Then based on access cash, we look at whatever opportunities might exist out there and we are committed to increasing our dividend on an annualized basis as we grow earnings. And then we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to return dollars to the shareholders down any other opportunities through share repurchase. So those are the fundamental basics that you know we hold true in this business. We still want to -- we do control ourselves to a percentage basis.\nKaren Short: Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the 14% operating margin guidance, obviously, you came in a little a little bit higher this year at 14.4%, is anything to call it there in terms of the 40-basis-point decline versus the prior 30-basis-point?\nCraig Menear: No. It\u2019s really just a reflection of outperformance in Q4 and sort of rounding up to a 14.4% rather than, than our expectations around 2020, which has not changed. But with great execution across the business from sales to gross margins to operating expense, it was a team effort and we\u2019re proud of the results we deliver.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then just last one for me, is there any update you could provide on additional personalization and functionality on the B2B and maybe any color you could provide on behavior with the Pros and/or conversions with respect to the ones you\u2019ve on-boarded?\nCraig Menear: Look, we continue to drive engagement with the Pros that we\u2019ve on-boarded to the B2B website. We like what we see as those Pros accelerate their engagement and -- but again, it -- we are also, as I mentioned before, we\u2019re building a complete ecosystem around the Pro. The B2B website is one portion of that experience but encompasses all the things that I laid out before.\nKaren Short: Okay. Great. Thanks\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel: Thank you for taking my question. Nice quarter.\nCraig Menear: Thanks you.\nBrian Nagel: So I wanted just take a step back a bit. At a meeting in December, we spent a lot of time talking about the investment initiatives. And then you would highlight the benefits of some of these were not coming as quickly as you initially thought that they were still coming. I guess, I want an update there, as we look at the business now, you had a very nice quarter, you seem -- excited about the initiatives. Have you seen more progress on that front then was articulated in December?\nCraig Menear: Well, I think, as we shared in December that, we would continue to see the investments have a payback as we move forward and that is what we\u2019re seeing. I think the quarter in particular, as Ted called, was a combination of the strength that we see in terms of the events that we put in place, the product offering that we brought to the market, the continued development of our initiatives. It\u2019s all those things coming together that actually delivered on this quarter. So, yeah, we\u2019re pleased with the continued growth that we see in the initiatives. But at the same time, really proud of the team, the execution by our stores was outstanding. The supply chain team did a great job. Our suppliers gave us outstanding products and values. And the customer\u2019s ability to start that shopping experience in the digital world and research product and/or purchase product there, all of that is leading to the kind of performance that we saw in the fourth quarter.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. Then my follow up Craig and I guess so much of questions on shrink and other topic we spent a lot of times discussion in the December Analyst Meeting. How much of a swing factor could shrink be here in 2020 to the extent that you were able to improve the performance versus what we saw in 2019?\nCraig Menear: I think as we shared in December, we\u2019re in the process of implementing our initiatives to mitigate the impact from shrink. It will take time for us to actually realize the benefit as that flows through the P&L because we basically do the inventory in the stores once a while.\nTed Decker: And it\u2019s a phased rollout.\nCraig Menear: Right.\nTed Decker: We\u2019ve piloted approaches. We feel very confident about those results, but we still learn as we go. We feel confident. And as Craig said, not only do you have the rollout, but you also have the actual recognition in the P&L, which is on a lag basis as we take inventories.\nBrian Nagel: All right. Thank you and good luck to the spring.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nTed Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. Thank you. Regarding the margin guidance for 2020 can you talk about what assumptions you\u2019re making for product margin and the mix impacts on gross margin?\nRichard McPhail: Sure. For competitive reason, we don\u2019t detail that\u2026\nCraig Menear: Yeah. We wouldn\u2019t do that.\nRichard McPhail: Yeah.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Okay. So on -- and but there\u2019s no expectation that mix could be negative given that appliance sales have been so strong, for example, or is there anything built into your gross margin assumption in terms of mix?\nCraig Menear: Well, there is, and as we had outlined in December, and if you think about the walk to the 14.0% guidance. You start with the fact that we\u2019re going to generate operating expense leverage on a business as usual basis, sort of underlying everything. But then recall, this is the peak year of investment of our three year investment program. So that will put pressure on margin. And then we see the impact from shrink, which is we said, we\u2019re taking steps to address and also from mix, but the mixed pressure is a good pressure. This is the pressure that reflects the fact that we\u2019re taking share in categories, like appliances like power tools, like outdoor power. And so, while we do think that there is mix pressure there, our objective is to grow incremental market share, incremental sales and incremental operating profit dollars and we do that through attacking our market opportunities in front of us.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Got it. Okay. And has there been products that have been excluded from terrorists retroactively where you\u2019re now getting refunds and are those refunds a positive offset to your cost of goods sold?\nTed Decker: Yes. I would say, first off, huge thank you for our combined merchandising finance supply chain global sourcing team as they\u2019ve worked through this tariff issue all year and we put a lot of effort on it and the teams did an exceptional job that follows into the exclusions because that\u2019s a whole body of work that, excuse me, you need to follow what\u2019s being submitted and requested to be excluded and literally get it down to the skew identifier and then file all the requisite paperwork to get the approvals, that the massive body of work that the team is currently undertaking. And one big category, huge growth category for us that has been excluded now is luxury vinyl plank in the flooring business, that\u2019s probably the single biggest one and we\u2019re actively working to get that refund back from tariffs previously paid.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Okay. So those -- and have those refunds impacted your fourth quarter at all or are they more going forward you\u2019re likely to see some of that impact in the first half of the year?\nCraig Menear: There was some of that.\nTed Decker: There was some benefit, but ins and outs of the quarter, we still feel great about the overall performance.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Hey. Good morning. Curious if you could speak specifically to the outlook for your e-commerce business in fiscal \u201820. And given all the initiatives around fulfillment and Pro, curious whether you expect that 20% growth handle to continue whether you\u2019re still adding any categories and what you think that 2020 drivers could be?\nCraig Menear: We\u2019re excited about our e-commerce business as part of a whole interconnected retail strategy. We believe that the front door of our store is not on the customer\u2019s pocket, it\u2019s on the job site that most of our customer shopping experience actually starts in the digital world even if it finishes in the physical world. As Ted has talked about, we have expanded our assortment into more categories online around the home. We think that is a continued opportunity as customers have shared with us that they believe that we can bring great value in these home categories and they trust us to bring that value. So we think that our digital business continues to be an engine for growth, both in the digital world and in the physical world.\nTed Decker: And it\u2019s not a separate business. It is it is managed by our merchandising team, all one merchandising team, right? And so rather than think about a separate business, you have to think about as a capability.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And on the appliance category curious if you could talk a little more about the impact of taking home delivery in-house and considering your share gains in the category over the past several years. Could you comment on how much you think share wise is still up for grabs and where do you think it\u2019s coming from?\nMark Holifield: Yeah. We are really pleased, excuse me, it\u2019s Mark. We\u2019re really pleased with the work we\u2019ve done in our market delivery operations or MDOs. Those are staffed with orange apron, The Home Depot associates who are ensuring that the freight comes into those locations and is dispatched properly to the customer damage free. And they\u2019re also working to ensure that there\u2019s a great customer experience they\u2019re working with the delivery teams. So I really pleased with the progress there. As Craig mentioned in his comments, we\u2019ve got a dozen of those up. We have another dozen or so leases signed, and we\u2019re going to continue to roll those out through 2020 and as we do we continue to see an improvement to our on time performance, reschedule rate and or customer satisfaction.\nCraig Menear: And I\u2019d say an opportunity to keep growing. There\u2019s still lots of participants regional, super regionals, even mom and pop furniture stores that have clients offering. So we think there\u2019s still lots of share out there. I mean, clearly, Shears had been a donor over the years and very markedly diminished store base. But we still see just a huge market that we\u2019ve had a disruptive attitude in this space for a long time and that\u2019s continuing to pay dividends as we picture.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Appreciate the time.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Sigman: Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. A couple follow ups here, first, on the guidance and specifically the cadence. Richard, I think he gave us a comp cadence similar throughout the year. How should we be thinking about gross margin and SG&A, and I guess, just the cadence of investments. Should we be thinking about more pressure on the operating margin in the first half relative to the second half.\nRichard McPhail: First, we think about it in halves and we don\u2019t provide specific half guidance. We\u2019re looking in a relatively balanced year across the house.\nSeth Sigman: Got it. Okay. And then just to follow up on the exit rate, January being a better month here, should we be thinking about any sort of pull-forward because of weather? Or do you think it\u2019s some combination of your initiatives and just solid demand overall? And then just some related piece here around the macro, it sounds like you\u2019re maintaining a relatively conservative view. I guess, my question is really are you seeing any sort of improvement or divergence in maybe markets that we\u2019re slowing last year and are starting to get a little bit better, any change in performance there that would maybe lead you to believe that housing backdrop is just better for the business right now? Thanks.\nRichard McPhail: I\u2019d say, first of all, on regional variability, this past quarter was one of the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in recent times and we don\u2019t see any widespread variability. It\u2019s really early to determine how the business plays out for the first half. We\u2019ve always talked about this in terms of halves because anything can happen from a weather standpoint that could either accelerate or delay a spring and then you generally work to capture that in the first half. That\u2019s really our approach. We\u2019re not seeing anything that would have us any differently to that whatsoever.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Understood. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our allotted time for questions. Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Great. Thank you, Christine. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in May.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-11-19 13:40:05", "content": "Operator: Greetings. And welcome to The Home Depot Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear, Chairman, CEO and President; Ted Decker, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by welcoming Richard to his first earnings call. Sales for the third quarter were $27.2 billion, an increase of 3.5% versus last year. Comp sales were up 3.6% from last year. And our U.S. comps were positive 3.8%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.53 in the third quarter. From a geographic perspective, all of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps. Internationally, both Canada and Mexico posted positive comps. Overall, we continue to see strong and engage customers. As Ted will detail both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter with the exception of lumber and electrical, all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. We saw a healthy balance of growth between both our Pro and DIY customers with pro sales outpacing DIY sales in the U.S. While our third quarter results largely demonstrate broad-based growth across geographies and merchandising departments our sales performance was below our expectations, driven primarily by the timing of certain benefits associated with our strategic initiatives. At the beginning of the year, we shared with you our expectation that these initiatives would collectively contribute approximately a 100 basis points to our comp performance in 2019. As the years evolve, we have learned a great deal and have shared with you that some of these initiatives have progressed more quickly while others are taking more time.  These investments are significant and long-term in nature. And we expect that the momentum we've seen will continue to build. Our rollout is largely on track and we're realizing benefits. It's just taking a little longer than our original assumptions. In a moment Richard will walk you through the implications this has for our 2019 guidance, but let me first provide more contexts. We've foundational IT work stream supporting many of our strategic initiatives that will significantly enhance our ability to serve our customers in an interconnected way.  Much of this IT work requires unwinding our legacy systems. And that has proven to be more complex than originally anticipated. Take the B2B website experience for example. Our investments in a personalized B2B website experience is a significant component of the unique value proposition we're creating for our pros. As you would expect, the most engaged customer cohort is a 135,000 pros that we on-boarded at the beginning of the year. And we're seeing meaningful lift in spend as these customers become more familiar with the new experience.  The rollout of the B2B site experience itself is on track. But underlying IT work must be completed before turning on additional elements of personalization and functionality for our larger Pro customers. Other investments are yielding results in line with or in some cases above our expectations. For example, HomeDepot.com continues to be a source of strength. Online traffic growth was healthy. Conversion is up and third quarter online sales grew approximately 22% from the third quarter of 2018. Customers continue to respond to the ongoing investments and enhancements we're making to drive a frictionless, interconnected experience, including faster fulfillment options. We also continued to leverage our digital platforms to drive incremental growth from adjacent categories like HD Home, Cool and Workwear and are seeing good traction across all of these categories. We're seeing healthy growth in our online sales and online shoppers continue to see the relevance of our stores as more than 50% of our online US orders were picked up in our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. We continued to rollout automated lockers in our stores to make pickup of online orders easier and more convenient. To date, approximately 1,300 stores have lockers. And we've been very pleased with the customer response. As approximately 95% of customers rating their locker experience pickup give us a five out of five stars. We fundamentally believe that when a customer comes to one of our stores it has to be a great experience. Over 60% of our US stores have a new look and feel and customer response has been very positive. Customer service scores in the category of neat and clean have increased to 120 basis points versus last year. While scores for check-out times satisfaction have increased over 280 basis points versus last year.  As we approach the end of the second year of our transformative One Home Depot investments, we have even more conviction today that we're making the right, long-term investments for the business to extend our competitive advantage in the marketplace. As with any transformation, the work we're doing is complex and I'm proud of the way our team is consistently up for the challenge. Our associates continue to focus on what's most important in our business, our customers. And I want to close by thanking them for their hard work and dedication. And with that let me turn the call over to Ted. \nTed Decker: Thanks Craig, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we saw strength across most of our departments, driven by growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. Comps in appliances, Indoor Garden, D\u00e9cor and Storage, Hardware, Tools, Outdoor Garden, Paint and Plumbing were above the company average. All other departments with the exception of electrical and lumber were positive but below the company average. Electrical was essentially flat due to light bulbs and deflation in copper. While lumber reported low single-digit negative comp due to continued commodity price deflation, we saw strong unit comp growth. During the third quarter, we saw balanced growth with both transactions and ticket. Comp transactions increased 1.8% during the third quarter, acceleration from what we saw in the first half of 2019. The strength in our comp transactions was driven in part by the strategic store investments geared at improving the customer experience and extended outdoor season and traffic growth in a number of core categories. We also saw solid performance from big ticket transactions. During the third quarter, big ticket comp transactions are those over $1,000 which represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were up 4.8%. Excluding hurricane-related markets, big ticket comp transactions were up 5.5%. In the third quarter, comp average ticket also increased 1.8%. We remain pleased with the performance of our ticket growth despite significant lumber price deflation. The increase in our comp average ticket continues to be positively impacted by our customers trading up to new and innovative items. During the third quarter, commodity deflation in lumber and copper negatively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 80 basis points.  Let me take a moment to comment on tariffs. As expected, during the third quarter we saw increased cost rising from tariffs. Our merchants, finance and data analytics teams are doing an incredible job mitigating cost impacts and helping us evaluate our elasticities. While still early days, we continue to believe we can effectively manage tariffs. However, we remain cautious on how tariffs could impact the consumer more broadly. Going forward, we will use our tools and analytics to help us continue to focus on being the customers advocate for value. During the third quarter, we saw growth in both our Pro and DIY customers. Sales for our Pro customers which we estimate represent approximately 45% of overall sales continue to outpace DIY sales in the U.S. We're investing in resets services and a suite of tools to drive a better customer experience and save our Pros time and money. In the third quarter, we saw strong growth in Pro-heavy categories like fasteners, pneumatics, concrete and installation.  Turning to our DIY customer, as summer started to wind down, we saw customers take advantage of the extended outdoor season. During the third quarter, categories like Patio Furniture, Exterior Stains and Paint, Soils and Live Goods, all had comps well above the company average. Our digital investments in interconnected strategy are working. As you heard from Craig, we're enhancing features, functionality and category presentations on our website. We continue to see growth in online traffic, conversion and average ticket. In fact, during the third quarter, we saw double-digit online growth in nearly all of our departments. And given the project nature of our business more than 50% of these online U.S. orders were picked up in our stores.  Let's look at Patio Furniture as an example, the category we know our customers shop both online and in our stores. Recently, we rolled out a new online category presentation in Patio that allows our customers to easily see the entire collection, different colors and styles, as well as various fulfillment options, all on one page. These new enhancements helped drive our strongest patio comp in the last 10 years.  And now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we talked about the incredible response we're seeing from our customers to our industry-leading lineup of exclusive cordless outdoor power equipment from RYOBI, Milwaukee to Walt and EGO. We're excited to add Makita's new line of 18-volt outdoor tools to our assortment. Makita's 18-volt platform has over 225 tools in over 30 million batteries in the U.S. market. During the fourth quarter, we will add a powerful trimmer, lower hedge trimmer and chainsaw to that assortment. All compatible with Makita's award winning portable power platform.  We're proud to be Makita's exclusive big box partner. In addition, we're thrilled about the upcoming holiday season. Our merchants have worked hard to establish The Home Depot as the holiday shopping destination. We have worked tirelessly with our supplier partners to put together a broad assortment of product offerings and the best value for the holidays. As in previous years, we will have a number of special buys for Black Friday along with an in-store gift center showcasing great offers from our exclusive brands.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard. \nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Ted. And good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, total sales were $27.2 billion, an increase of 3.5% or $921 million versus the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Our total company comps were positive 3.6% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.1% in August, 3.7% in September and 3.1% in October. Comps in the U.S. were positive 3.8% for the quarter, with positive comps of 4.4% in August, 3.9% in September, and 3.3% in October versus last year, a stronger US dollar negatively impacted comp sales growth by approximately $41 million or 0.2%. As you will recall, fiscal 2018 had a 53rd week which shifted our fiscal 2019 calendar. As a result of this shift, our comp in October was negatively impacted due to the timing of our Black Friday event last year versus this year. This shift in timing --in event timing negatively impacted our US October comp by approximately 100 basis points.  US comps for the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately 35 basis points. As you just heard from Ted, during the third quarter, lumber prices remain depressed versus last year as lumber price deflation negatively impacted our comp sales growth by approximately $175 million, or over 65 basis points. In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.5%, a decrease of 31 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin was primarily driven by higher shrink and the mix of products sold compared to last year.  In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 10 basis points versus last year to 20%. Our operating expense performance reflects strong expense control and continued productivity in the business, as well as continued investments in our strategic initiatives, specifically expenses related to our strategic investment plan of $277 million increased by approximately $44 million from last year and resulted in approximately 13 basis points of operating expense deleverage. This deleverage was offset by productivity and BAU or Business As Usual expenses which drove 23 basis points of operating expense leverage.  Our operating margin for the third quarter was 14.5%, a decrease of 21 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter grew by $56 million to $280 million due primarily to higher long -term debt levels than one year ago. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.5% compared to 21.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. For the year, we now expect our effective tax rate will be slightly lower than 25%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $2.53, an increase of 0.8% from last year. In October, a devastating round of storms and tornados impacted the Dallas area. During these storms, tornados destroyed one of our stores in Dallas. And our thoughts continued to be with that community and are impacted associates.  At the end of third quarter, we had an ending store count of 2,290 and total sales per square foot were $449, up 3.5% from last year. At the end of the quarter, inventory turns were 5x down from 5.2x last year, reflecting a load-in of inventory in support of our strategic initiatives. Moving on to capital allocation. In the third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 5.2 million shares of outstanding stock. This included repurchases of approximately 2.0 million shares on the open market and approximately 3.2 million shares through an accelerated share repurchase or ASR program. Note that for the shares repurchased under the ASR, it is an initial calculation. Final number of shares repurchased in the third quarter will be determined in the fourth quarter when the ASR terminates. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 -months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.1% or 290 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2018.  Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As we approached the end of the second year of investment geared at achieving our One Home Depot vision. We're confident that we're making the right investments for the business to extend our competitive advantage over the long term. As Craig said, these initiatives are gaining momentum and are contributing to our sales growth. But some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions. As a result, today we are updating our fiscal 2019 sales guidance. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. The fiscal 2019 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2018, which includes sales and earnings associated with a 53rd week.  For fiscal 2019, we now expect comp sales as calculated on a 52-week basis to increase by approximately 3.5%. And we now expect sales reflecting the compare of 53-weeks last year to increase by approximately 1.8%. We're also reaffirming our earnings-per-share guidance for fiscal 2019. We expect fiscal 2019 diluted earnings-per-share to grow approximately 3.1% to $10.03. We look forward to talking with you at our Investor Conference on December 11th in New York where we will give you an update on our key strategic initiatives, as well as some initial thoughts around fiscal. 2020. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine we're now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. \nSimeonGutman: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is what gives you confidence in these initiatives hitting? And then what gives you proof that it's the initiatives that are taking longer to realize and not something slowing in the macro. And then I have one follow-up.\nCraigMenear: So let me start with the initiatives. First of all, we're seeing benefits from the initiatives. It's just not at the rate of our original plan. And when we look at the investments that we're making in this business, as we shared with you back in December of 2017, we're doing this for the long-term health of the business and to position ourselves to win competitively in the long term. This is such a big opportunity that we're going to do this right and continue to make sure that we are delivering an experience that our customers are accustomed to getting from the Home Depot. And so we think we're getting about half of the investment benefit in 2019. And as we continue to add additional features and benefits as we unwind some of the complexities of our legacy systems, we'll see that continue to grow. And as it relates to how do we know it's not something else? We continue to see broad-based growth in our business. As Ted called out, we had great strength in ticket transactions. We had strength in big ticket. We saw our pro business accelerate during the quarter. And when we look at what happens in discretionary spend categories particularly that are high ticket discretionary spend we don't see anything there that concerns us at this point. \nSimeonGutman: Okay and my follow-up is if you look at the construct of the existing three-year plan and you start from today where 2019 margins are going to land looks like around 14.4. It would call for flattish margins next year to up as much as 60, if you take the original plan. If the macro is not any different than you plan which it sounds like it's not, what would cause that to change? This range of flat to up 60.\nTedDecker: Hi, there, Simeon. So what I would say is, first of all, we're focused on delivering on the guidance for the year and look forward to talking about 2020 at our Investor December conference. Clearly, there has been pressure to our margin from shrink which was the highest contributor to the decrease year-over-year within those 31 basis points. And so that is an unplanned pressure and we're taking steps and have many initiatives in place to address that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. \nMichaelLasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You mentioned that you're getting about 50 basis points of lift from the return on investments rather than anticipated 100 basis points that you previously expected. Is there any reason why we shouldn't just take that delta the incremental 50 basis points and just tack it on to what we're modeling for next year? That speaks to both the nature of the return and the timing associated with the return. \nCraigMenear: Michael, I think as we look at the investments that we're making, we expect that through the balance of 2019 as we move into 2020, we will continue to see the momentum build off the investments that we're making. I don't know that we see it as a straight line, but it certainly will continue to ramp. As we shared in my opening comments, for example on the B2B website experience, the first 135,000 customers that we put on early in the year, we're seeing very nice results. As we onboard more and we on-boarded a number recently at the end of the quarter, as we continue to see them engaged they get more familiar with the experience we see lift.  So we're definitely confident that we will continue to see some momentum build through the investments that we're making. \nRichardMcPhail: And it's also if you think, Michael, about the investments we've made in our store environment and Ted and Ann may want to comment a little bit about that. We know that the changes we're making are resonating with our customer and we're seeing positive lift from that. \nAnnMarieCampbell: Yes, no. Thank you, Richard. Couple of things that Craig called out. First of all, when you think about our sales growth and our online sales growth and what we've seen in the stores that 50% that's picked up in the stores as we continue to make that easy for customers, we're seeing just incredible repeat as we think about transactions. So we're going to continue to lean into things that really simplify the experience for more customers. We're also continuing to add delivery capabilities outside of the stores as well with our car and Van delivery which really benefits to our pro customer. And we see that accelerated through the quarter. And when you think about our VOC scores, Craig called it out, as we think about all lockers and but we're also seeing increased VOC scores on our checkout process on the front end as well.  So you think about the investments we're making and we think about the fourth quarter coming up we're going to see increased traffic or customers, another time of introducing all these investments to our customers which we believe is just going to drive tremendous loyalty. \nMichaelLasser: That's helpful. And my follow-up question is you're guiding to a 5% comp that's implied for the fourth quarter. And that would be higher than what you've done throughout the course of this year. So what's driving your more optimistic expectation? Is it that you're going to see this accelerating return from the investments or are there other factors that you can outline that can help bridge to that 5% you're guiding to for the fourth-quarter? Thank you.\nRichardMcPhail: Michael, thanks for the question. We're very comfortable with our guide based on the momentum Ted called out. And while our guidance does imply acceleration, that acceleration is mostly caused by the absence or reversal of pressures we saw in Q3 as we walked to Q4. From lumber deflation, from FX and from an event timing shifts that we saw in Q3. So you can look at it a couple of ways to normalize Q3. If you take the quarterly comp of 3.6% and you add back 60 basis points from a much lower level of pressure from lumber, we'll see in Q4 versus Q3. And you add back 35 basis points from the impact of event timing to Q3 where basically our Q3 comped over the first week of Black Friday from last year's Q4 due to the calendar shifts and then you add back 30 basis points from favorable FX compares. You'll see Q4 is actually right in line with a normalized Q3. You can look at it another way. You could take our October comp of 3.1% as an exit rate. You'd add back a 100 basis points from that event timing impact. Lumber of 60% and FX of 30. And again you will see why we have confidence in the progression from Q3 to Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nScotCiccarelli: Good morning, guys. Two follow-ups. First, so when we think about the impact of both the Black Friday event and lumber pricing. When we're thinking about a net impact kind of negative 25 basis points. Is that right, Richard?\nRichardMcPhail: From lumber, yes. \nScotCiccarelli: Okay, got it. \nRichardMcPhail: [Multiple Speaker] your questions. \nAnnMarieCampbell: Can you repeat the question? \nRichardMcPhail: Repeat the question.\nScotCiccarelli: Yes. Just the net impact, right. You had some of the Black Friday event kind of fall into fourth quarter this year versus 3Q last year, plus you had the lumber pricing. I guess I'm trying to figure out what's the net impact? The comments you've made suggests it's about 25 basis points on a net basis.\nRichardMcPhail: No, they actually both go the same way. So 35 basis points of negative pressure to Q3 and 60 basis points of negative pressure, sorry 35 basis points from event timing and 60 basis points from lumber pressure. So they add to about 95 basis points really sort of alleviation of those pressures as we walk from Q3 to Q4. And then if you're looking at total company comp where there was a 20 basis point differential between total company and US in the third quarter. And then you bring FX into play and we will have about a 30 basis point favorable compare in the fourth quarter. Does that make sense?\nScotCiccarelli: I think so. And then a follow-up question on your shrink comment. Has the pressure from shrink continued to increase? Or/and related to that, do you have any feel for if it's being driven more by internal? Let's call it, test or issues or if it's more external? Thanks. \nCraigMenear: Scott, it is continuing to increase. We've seen the pressure. But we have a number of initiatives underway. \nAnnMarieCampbell: Yes. I'll add certainly in the departments that we are seeing increased pressure; they are more what we considered kind of malicious. And we've had initiatives underway and have implemented in our high-risk store. Some of the things we've done in the past to make sure that we secure all products. But in addition to that, we are working through initiatives from a technology perspective as well. Because we want to make sure that we have a long-term solution to mitigate this risk as well. So while we're doing certain things in the short-term to release some of this pressure, we're also working on the initiatives in the long term. \nScotCiccarelli: And so when would you expect that trend, if you will, to start to reverse?\nAnnMarieCampbell: We have an expectation in the stores that we have implemented. Some of the initiatives that will start to bend the curve. But as I said, we've done that in our high risk stores first. And we want to make sure that as we protect the top-line; we're mitigating and really created a good experience for customers. So we're going to continue to monitor. But some of the things we've seen in the short-term have been really positive in these high-risk stores that we've implemented. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question. \nSteveForbes: Good morning I wanted to follow up on the investment plan for this year. So I think you called out $44 million or yes, $44 million of pressure, right, from higher spend this year. But can you just remind us what the plan is for the whole year relative to 2018? Because I thought I guess, both in absolute dollars, because I thought the P&L pressure was going to be similar, right, same dollar impact 2019 versus 2018. So should we expect a reversal or a benefit in the fourth quarter? \nCraigMenear: The investment plan actually ramp through\nRichardMcPhail: Yes. The investment plan ramps actually from a total -- and remember I'm calling out capital and expense here. But a total investment plan of about $3.3 billion last year ramping to an investment plan of about $3.6 billion this year. And so and that's in line with the plan that we set back in 2017. And so the expense year-over-year is really sort of in line with that lift as well because expenses generally lift with the capital.\nSteveForbes: So just a follow-up on that. So can you help us break that down between capital and expenses? Or is it really just the incremental, is the $300 million spread between those two numbers?\nRichardMcPhail: It's actually, so the breakdown for 2019 is about $2.6 billion in capital and about $1 billion in expense which is higher than last year's levels. But it really is just that increment of ramping up to $1 billion in expense that you see in the P&L. And the cadence of those investments quarter-to-quarter over the year are relatively steady ramping up through the year and peaking in Q4. As you would expect, as we continue to ramp investment off and investment will be higher in 2020 than it was in 2019. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. \nChristopherHorvers: Thanks. Good morning. The market growth has moderated in 2019 relative to the past couple of years. Was that your expectation coming in? And do you think that lower mortgage rates allow the market growth rate to reaccelerate from here? So I think there's sort of a base case 4% market growth rate was a three-year plan or do you think that maybe that market growth rate moderates a bit further given where we're later into the cycle?\nCraigMenear: And what we shared at the beginning of this year, we didn't expect that the market growth will be slightly less than it was in the previous year. And so that was part of our overall expectations. I mean when we look at the market in total, however, we play in a $600 billion market that we own about 17% of. And if you look at third-party data, it would indicate that we took significant share in Q3. And so we look at this as an opportunity going forward. We always talked to the merchants about the fact that we don't own enough share to worry about how that market growth itself. We just need to stay focused on the customer and continuing to drive the business.\nRichardMcPhail: I think there's another point to that, Chris, which is really just looking at the headline of 4% market growth. And what we experienced in 2019 from a lumber deflation perspective. As we shared with you earlier in the year that's going to be about $800 million of pressure to us, but it will be pressure in the market in general. And so when you sort of round that out, you're looking at market growth or sort of our base case assumption of 4% lower down to around 3%. And, in fact, the fact that we're guiding 3, 5 today shows that we think we're getting about 0.5 from initiatives. \nChristopherHorvers: And so do you expect, so I guess the puts and takes as you look forward, as you've got the benefits from initiatives which I think back to the three-year plan you had expected that to ramp or I guess even over the five year plan. But then on the other side you have sort of the rate factors. So do you think that rates allow the underlying market growth rate to reaccelerate and maybe get some back --get back some of the deflation. So the underlying growth rate actually could be better as you look forward?\nRichardMcPhail: What I would say is the macro and housing environment have played out right in line with our expectations. And the description we would use is housing is healthy and stable. There's no doubt that recent movements in the rate environment are going to create support for that stability. But as we've said for many years, we expected that we would see that from 2012 a period of moderate housing recovery and a period of sharp housing recovery. And then a period of stability in housing and that has played out. And so I would say again housing is healthy and stable. The rate environment certainly provides support to that.\nChristopherHorvers: That's very helpful. So my follow-up is on the extended season that was an impressive traffic number. Do you think that extended season was weather understand you lapped hurricane last year, but was just extended season additive to comp for this quarter? \nTedDecker: Hey, Chris. It's Ted. Yes and no. I'd say certainly the extended season we did well in things like exterior stains and paint and some garden projects. But then in the Southeast in particular we had heavy drought as well. So there's some give and take with that. I think on the margin, we did do better with the extended season. I would say those are fundamental drivers of the business is the bigger story. When we think about this balance of ticket and transaction growth, we always start the year planning and expecting a balance of ticket and transaction that really plays out that way, but to see 1.8% growth in ticket, 1.8% growth in transactions. Real underlying stories also unit growth. We saw our strongest units as Craig called out in a year and a few adjust for as we've always called it the bathtub effector spring or if you have a weak Q1, you have a stronger Q2 depending on weather hits. When you normalize for the bathtub effect, this was our strongest units in two years across the entire business. As Craig said, it's across geographies. And it's actually across the store where we're seeing this unit productivity. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Nomura. Please proceed with your question. \nMichaelBaker: Thanks. A couple of follow-ups on the gross margin. First, what are you seeing competitively in terms of pricing? And if you could touch on the paint category in particular? And then secondly, as it relates to tariffs, you said you were-- you think you can manage tariffs. What has managed tariffs mean? Does that mean it has an impact on gross margins, but you can offset it elsewhere or basically what a tariffs doing to the gross margins? Thanks. \nCraigMenear: So from a competitive standpoint to begin with, we see a continued escalated promotional environment in the marketplace. That would include the categories of paint. That doesn't seem to be abating whatsoever. Ted and the merchant team are sticking to our strategy of delivering great everyday value to our customers. We know that that's for long-term right approach for the business and has played well for us over time. So that is absolutely. Ted, I don\u2019t know if you want comment on tariff.\nTedDecker: Yes, on tariffs. Since this started, we said we believe it's manageable. And when I say that our finance teams merchants and data analytics teams have really drilled into the overall impact of the business. We know down to the SKU level the point of origin, the classification of the tariff, the potential impact. And from there we start working with our supplier partners to mitigate that tariff impact. We all know that on the margin, all goods have elasticities. And if you don't have to put price through, you are going to retard unit productivity. So each of Home Depot and our supplier partners are laser-focused on maintaining unit growth in this business. So we will work on mitigating the tariff impact to change country of origin, to change makeup of the product itself to add other features and benefits that can add value to the consumer.  With all that being said, we have offset from what would be not theoretical, the actual SKU level buildup of tariff impacts. We have offset well over half. So out of the gate there is no impact on well over half of the potential tariff impact to our business, again working closely with our supplier partners and with the balance of the impact that is a manageable set of actions we're taking across the portfolio not necessarily in the tariff SKU itself, but we have moved on some retails and that's implied. When I said we're measuring the various elasticities and where we've had to move and where we've acted in a portfolio fashion.  We've maintained unit productivity as I said, whether effective, this is our best units last quarter in over two years. So I would sum all that up to the content that we believe it's managing. \nMichaelBaker: That's a lot of color. And very helpful. One more just a follow-up to a previous question, just on the housing in the macro. I get that you're talking about it being stable, but if we just look at it simply, simple measures of existing home sales. They have picked up as of late really six to nine months ago. And historically that does lead to better comps for you guys. So I guess are you surprised that comps aren't accelerating on the back of housing or should we expect that maybe early next year?\nCraigMenear: I go back right to the base kind of comp that, Richard, walk through with you as we look forward. And the underlying health of the business is very solid. Great transaction growth, great unit growth, broad-based across the business. If you candidly look at where we thought this year would play out to where we are today. I mean 70-plus percent of the variance to the current year-to-date performance is lumber deflation, plain and simple. So we feel good about the environment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nKarenShort: Hi, thanks very much. And just a question on housekeeping, last quarter you gave big ticket growth by month. I was wondering if you would be willing to provide that this quarter. And then I had a bigger picture question. \nCraigMenear: I don't think we have that with us here right now. We can provide that. If you want to call in the Investor Relations department. \nKarenShort: Okay. And then switching to the 20-20 investment comments. So you commented that the 20-20 investment would be higher versus 2019. So I guess the question is does that comments apply to both expense and capital? And then within the expense, is that still more skewed to D&A versus SG&A?\nCraigMenear: Look, we've got our Investor Conference in a couple of weeks and we will provide all the color around this at that time. Right now we're laser-focused on delivering the balance of this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. \nZachFadem: Hey, good morning. So following up on the SG&A investment question for this year. You spent $277 million in the quarter that gets me to about $820 million in operating expenses so far this year, if my math is right. So how much of this would you categorize as strategic versus business as usual investment? And then I just want to confirm you don't expect these strategic investments to step down in Q4 to get to that $1 billion for the year that you've talked about.\nRichardMcPhail: So all of the investments that we call out are strategic investment of $277 million in Q3. We've guided to planned number of around a $1 billion and we'll be north of $1 billion this year, right in line with expectations. As we set them out at the beginning of the year. \nZachFadem: Okay. And then on the 100 basis point calendar headwind in October, could you expand on that just a little bit more? I just want to confirm that this will be a similar benefit to November. And then when you think about the moving parts lumber deflation in Q4 and then the hurricane headwind perhaps subsiding. Why do you think the implied 5 percent-ish comp in Q4 is the right place to land? And are there any other moving parts that we should keep in mind?\nTedDecker: I'll speak to the events. So from a merchandizing calendar, it's very heavy this time of year. So we set our pro Black Friday. We're bringing great values for our Pro. We bring in appliance Black Friday which is a very, very large appliance event. And then we set our gift center which is a lot of power tools, power tool accessories, hand tools, gifting items. All of those initiatives kicked off on the calendar a week late relative to comp. In that we're quite confident that's the number of 100 basis points. And we see that flowing into Q4. In some of that actually will go into December on the end. So it doesn't all get in November, this will hit throughout November and December.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeterBenedict: So my question is just around the Pro B2B sign-up cadence. You've talked about a 135,000 or so that were signed up early in the year. Are you guys still expecting a million by the end of the year or have you kind of slowed the sign-ups because of some of the tech issues that you were talking?\nCraigMenear: No. We still expect to onboard about a million customers during the year. And we on-boarded a number of them at the tail end of Q3 right, Bill? \nBillLennie: Yes. Peter, we finished Q3 just above 780,000 pros that have been migrated onto the website. And we continue to add new capabilities as we go through the quarter. We now except the pro purchase card with our legacy interline customers so they can buy on HomeDepot.com. We've done things like introduced Buy It Again functionality. And we've made new user registration automatic. So as we have new customers signing up onto our Pro extra platform, we can get those customers at the time of sign-up and we can automatically migrate them to the B2B website. So we're on track with the customer migration and on-track with all the capabilities.\nPeterBenedict: So that million target, what --roughly what percent of your pros does that represent? And I guess what kind of penetration you guys think you can get longer-term?\nRichardMcPhail: Well, if you look at it, we think we can get all of our pros, our verified pro customers migrated onto the website over the long term. So that would represent about 30%.\nRichardMcPhail: Yes, about 30% of the total right now. And as we continue to build the base of capabilities then we will obviously do more as we had originally planned to then make that knowledgeable to our pros and market to them accordingly. \nPeterBenedict: Okay, great. And just my one follow-up would be just getting back to a question a little bit earlier, just around trade down. I know you mentioned some things around how you're trying to manage the elasticities and what not, but I am just, even absent of tariff. So have you seen any sign of trade down either within certain categories or what not or maybe some of the pros are opting for more middle line product as opposed to higher-end, I was curious if you're seeing anything there?\nTedDecker: No. We're not. So a couple points of observation there. Appliances for example, we continue to see trade up across just great innovation in clients business, we've introduced Fosh, which is approaching the higher, highest end of the category and picking up lots of net new business there. And then the phenomenon with the cordless power tools now going in outdoor power equipment, we're seeing great pickup and these are all higher price points with the innovation of technology and outdoor power equipment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nSethSigman: Hey, guys. Good morning. I did want to follow up on that last point. So when we look at your average ticket on a comp basis up 1.8 pretty similar to last quarter where it was 2%. I guess I'm surprised it's not accelerating more. Sound like you had a little bit less commodity deflation this quarter, big-ticket trends seem pretty healthy, maybe had a little bit of inflation on the back of tariffs. So I'm just curious is there something else that's holding back the ticket growth? Maybe is that the shift related to Black Friday where you have a lot of big ticket categories or something else maybe?\nTedDecker: Yes. That's exactly the big Delta would be the events for the holiday promotion. So think of appliances, your average ticket on appliance, gifting portable power tools, combo kits et cetera, so that 100 basis point isn't, that shifted isn't entirely ticket but much more so than transactions.\nRichardMcPhail: And I just say, Seth, that again when we think about the big ticket in this quarter over a $1,000 at 4.8 hurricane adjusted markets at 5.5 that is right in line with our expectations.\nSethSigman: Yes. Okay, that makes sense. And then just to follow back up on tariffs. It sounds like you guys have managed that really well and have found some offsets. How do we think about the same SKU inflation that is --that you're seeing in the business and how it may be impacting comps? And then just the second part of that, there have been some exclusions announced recently in certain categories that you do playing. And I'm just curious if that's meaningful at all for you guys. Thanks.\nTedDecker: Sure. I would I would say on the contribution of tariffs to that ticket growth, it's actually a very nominal amount. It's by far lower than for example the introduction of sales of new innovative higher price AUR items, is a far bigger driver of that 1.8% in any price moves we would have made associated with tariffs. And on the exclusions, we're working through that, it was last Friday we had a number of exclusions announced. A number in the flooring category that we are working our way through, very optimistic about what that is going to mean for Vinyl Plank. We believe most of our portfolio, the Luxury Vinyl Plank which has been our fastest-growing category and number of those items is seemingly going to be on the exclusion list. Again, we're working through the detailed, but we're very encouraged.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKateMcShane: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I just wanted to, you mentioned that the pro was still outpacing DIY. I just wondered if you had seen any changes in the Delta between the pro and DIY trends.\nRichardMcPhail: I think if we look at the last few quarters, the Delta hasn't changed dramatically, but we did see the pro strengthen some in this quarter. So both strengthen. But and then the one comment I would make about the pro business is we're seeing, Ted talked a little bit about the unit comps, which are very encouraging but the growth in Pro was primarily through transactions versus ticket. So just good broad base strength on the business.\nKateMcShane: Okay. Thank you for that color. I just had one follow-up question unrelated just with regards to the macro environment. If you could talk about any differential between the performance in different areas of affordability from a geographic standpoint.\nRichardMcPhail: We actually look at the regional variability every single quarter. And in the third quarter, it was actually the narrowest we've seen in quite some time. And that includes all states whether there are high salt states or not. So we are very pleased with the narrow variability that existed. End of Q&A\nOperator: Ms Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Conference in December.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $30.8 billion, up 1.2% from last year. Comp sales were up 3% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 3.1%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.17 in the second quarter. We're pleased with these results. We overcame a tough May and continued lumber price deflation to deliver accelerating comp performance throughout the quarter. Looking at our results geographically, all of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps. 17 of 19 U.S. regions also posted positive comps with the exceptions being our Gulf and Florida regions which delivered high storm-related comps last year. Internationally, Mexico posted high single digit positive comp and Canada posted low single digit positive comp, both in local currency. We saw broad-based growth across the stores, both comp ticket and transactions grew. With the exception of lumber, all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. We saw a healthy balance of growth among both Pro and DIY categories with Pro sales outpacing our DIY business in the U.S. As Ted will detail, we continue to invest in the portfolio of service offerings to deepen our level of engagement with the growth. We know that the more dimensional our relationship is with these customers, the more they spend. From a strategic perspective, I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we are making to deliver the One Home Depot experience, a seamless, interconnected shopping experience for our customers. Our in-store investments are focused on ease of navigation and improved speed to checkout. We have implemented our way-finding sign and store refresh package in over 1,400 of our U.S. stores. And customer service scores in the category of neat and clean, have increased 140 basis points. Our frontend store investments now at over 400 stores are designed to get customers in and out of stores faster, and they are doing just that. Customer service scores in checkout time satisfaction have increased over 450 basis points versus last year. While our stores remain the hub of our business, we know that many of our in-store sales are influenced by online visits and approximately 50% of all online U.S. orders were picked up in our stores during the quarter. Our customers continue to blend the channels of engagement, and we are investing to remove the friction as they do so. We continue to roll out automated pickup lockers for online orders with over 1,100 stores completed and have seen a 250 basis-point increase in checkout scores for stores with lockers versus those without. Our investment in the digital price labels for our appliance department has enabled us to incorporate ratings and reviews from the digital world into the store shopping experience, enhancing the overall customer experience in the category. As we invest to address the unique demands of an interconnected customer experience in stores, we also continue to invest in our website and local applications to further enhance the digital customer experience. Our focus on improving search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation and product content has yielded higher traffic, better conversion and continued sales growth. Second quarter online sales grew 20% from the second quarter of 2018. We also continue to leverage our digital platforms to drive incremental growth from new categories as we lean into adjacencies like HD Home pool and workwear. The traction we're seeing from investments across our digital and physical assets are encouraging, not only from a customer experience standpoint, but they are also driving productivity growth of the business. Our frontend investments are optimizing labor and merchandising space productivity. Digital appliance labels enable associates to be more productive with their time. Instead of spending multiple hours manually changing price signs, our associates can reallocate their time to engage with customers in a high touch category. The virtuous cycle of productivity at The Home Depot has been a hallmark of our operational excellence over the years, and continues as we move forward. Our focus on enhancing the customer experience and productivity extends to the supply chain investments as well. During the quarter, we completed the retrofit of our Hagerstown facility into a partial direct fulfillment center, which expands our one-day delivery capabilities or stock parcel goods from approximately 30% to approximately 50% of the U.S. population. We also drove productivity and cost out through our patronization [ph] efforts in our upstream supply chain. We are on track with our plans to create the fastest, most efficient delivery network in home improvement and are pleased with the progress that we have made thus far. Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. The building blocks of our financial model remain in place. As Carol will detail, we are lowering our sales guidance through the year, mostly to reflect the impact of lumber price deflation, as well as some conservatism to account for the recently announced tariffs. We now expect fiscal 2019 comp sales growth of approximately 4% and reaffirm our expectation for diluted earnings per share of $10.03. I want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work, which resulted in the highest quarterly sales in our Company history. And with that, let me turn the call over Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. While we had a slow start to the second quarter, we were pleased to see demand accelerate throughout the quarter as we helped our customers tackle a variety of interior and exterior projects. Looking at our departments, comps in appliances tools, d\u00e9cor and storage, indoor garden, building materials, paint, outdoor garden, hardware and plumbing were above the Company average. All other departments with the exception of lumber were positive but below the Company average. Lumber reported a high-single-digit negative comp due to commodity price inflation. Second quarter comp average ticket increased 2% and comp transactions increased 1%. Lumber prices remained depressed during the second quarter, and as a result, lumber negatively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 110 basis points. Last quarter, we talked about a 4x8 sheet of OSB selling for about $8, more than 50% below the price a year ago. During the second quarter, the price for that same sheet of OSB fell further to an average of about $7 60. During the second quarter, big ticket comp transactions for those over $1,000, which represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were up 3.7%, reflecting in part the impact of hurricane-related sales last year and lumber price deflation. Excluding hurricane-related markets only, big ticket transaction comps were nearly 5%. During the quarter, we saw strong performance in big ticket categories, like vinyl plank flooring, and patio. Last quarter, we talked to you about opportunities in our flooring businesses. While vinyl plank has been and continues to be one of the strongest performing product categories across the store, we identified a need to refine our assortment within our other flooring categories. For example, in special order carpet, we\u2019ve recently taken several actions. We upgraded all of our showrooms and reset the category to reflect the latest styles and trends, while offering the simpler shopping experience, showcasing a good, better, best line structure. Given the associate engagement that\u2019s extremely important for this category, we also enhanced our in-store training efforts to drive the better customer shopping experience. While early days, we\u2019re pleased with the results. During the second quarter, we saw growth in both our Pro and DIY customers with Pro sales outpacing DIY sales in the U.S. We continue to focus on our suite of Pro initiatives, because we know that the more we engage with them, the more they spend with us. We\u2019ve equipped our store associates with a number of tools and better understanding of their top Pro customers. Our My View system allows our Pro sales associates to access customer data information, so they can proactively work with our Pro customers and determine how we can better serve them. We continue to simplify the Pro shopping experience and expand engagement through services like tool rental, delivery and our new B2B online experience. While May was another wet month, we saw project demand in outdoor categories rebound as weather improved. Categories like concrete, exterior paint stains, live goods and mulch at comps above the Company average. In addition, we continue to see customers respond to our industry-leading brands and the innovation they are bringing to market. In our outdoor power equipment business, we\u2019re seeing strong customer demand and continued trade up to cordless tools like blowers, trimmers, and even lawnmowers. Exclusive cordless product for brands like Ryobi, Milwaukee, Dewalt, EGO provide our customers with superior functionality and runtime to keep their yards looking great. Switching gears, as you heard from Craig, we are happy with the progress we are making with our investments to deliver best-in-class interconnected shopping experience. Looking at our likelihood to shop again metric, 87% of our customers give us the best-in-class score of 5. Our strategic investments include accelerated merchandise and resets focused on upgrading showrooms, improving visual merchandising and refining assortments to drive a better in-store shopping experience. For example, we are rolling out a new color solution center in our paint department, which simplifies the color selection process for our customers, while emphasizing our price, color, and satisfaction guarantee. And our new Project Color app, an updated online experience, allows our customers to seamlessly explore, be inspired, and shop color online whenever or wherever they want. Another example is in pipe and fittings, we are resetting all of our bays, reconfiguring them to better showcase the assortment and freeing up space at new product categories for our customers. Now, let\u2019s turn our attentions to back half of the year. As the number one retailer of ladders, we\u2019re pleased to announce an expansion of our partnership with Werner, the number one brand for Pros. Multi-position ladders are the fastest growing segment of ladder category, and we are now the exclusive big box retailer of Werner multi-position ladders. We are also happy to announce an exciting new partnership with Louisville Ladder and their exclusive big box retailer, starting in the fourth quarter. Combining Warner with our exclusive Louisville Ladder and Gorilla brands, we\u2019re the leading destination for top Pro brands in the ladder category. Our merchants have worked hard to put together events and special buys for our customers in the third quarter. We are excited about our customers\u2019 continued appetite for home improvement projects, and in just weeks, we will host our Annual Labor Day event, followed by our Halloween harvest event. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. As you\u2019ll recall,, fiscal 2018 had a 53rd week, which shifted our fiscal 2019 calendar. Our comp sales are reported on a like-for-like basis, but total sales growth is reported on a fiscal year basis. In the second quarter, total sales were $30.8 billion, a 1.2% increase from last year, reflecting a shift in our fiscal calendar as well as the impact of deferred sales. Our total Company comps were positive 3% for the quarter with positive comps of 0.2% in May, 4.1% in June and 4.6% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 3.1% for the quarter with positive comps of 0.6% in May, 4.1% in June and 4.7% in July. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar and negatively impacted comp sales growth were approximately $29 million or 0.1%. As you just heard from Ted, during the second quarter, lumber prices remained depressed. Versus last year, this lumber price deflation negatively impacted our comp sales growth by approximately $340 million or over 100 basis points. In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33.8%, a decrease of 19 basis points from last year. The year-over-year change in our gross margin reflects the following factors: First, higher strength than last year resulted in approximately 9 basis points of gross margin contraction; second, changes in the mix of products sold drove approximately 8 basis points of gross margin contraction; and finally, we had 2 basis points of gross margin contraction in our supply chain, driven primarily by startup cost associated with our One Home Depot supply chain initiative. In the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales at 18% was essentially flat compared to last year. Our operating expense performance reflects the impact of our strategic investment plan and good expense control during the quarter. Specifically, expenses related to our strategic investment plan of $242 million increased by approximately $28 million from last year and resulted in approximately 8 basis points of operating expense deleverage. This deleverage was offset by productivity in BAU or business-as-usual expenses, which drove 7 basis points of operating expense leverage. Our operating margin for the second quarter was 15.9%, a decrease of 21 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter grew by $37 million to $283 million, due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than one year ago. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.6% compared to 24.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. For the year, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $3.17, an increase of 3.9% from last year. So, moving on to some additional highlights. During the quarter, we opened two new stores, one in the U.S. and one in Mexico for an ending store count of 2,291. Selling square footage at the end of the year was 238 million square feet. Total sales per square foot for the second quarter were $510, up 1.1% from last year. At the end of the quarter, inventory turns were 5.1 times, down from 5.4 times last year, reflecting in part a load-in of inventory in support of our strategic initiatives. For the year, we now expect our inventory turns to slow slightly from what we reported in fiscal 2018. Moving on to capital allocation. In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 6.2 million shares of outstanding stock. We plan to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding shares in the second half of the year, bringing fiscal 2019 share repurchases to $5 billion, in line with our guidance. Further, during the quarter, we took advantage of an attractive interest rate environment and raised $1.4 billion of long-term debt, of which $1 billion was used to repay senior notes that came due in June. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 43.7%, 580 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While global economic pessimism has increased due to geopolitics, currently, the U.S. consumer remains healthy. Consumer confidence is near record high levels and wages are up over 3% from last year. Housing metrics are in line with the assumptions we used to build our 2019 financial plan. Nonetheless, what we didn't expect when we built our plan was the significant lumber price deflation we\u2019ve experienced. We are now more than halfway through the year and lumber prices are below the levels we saw in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, the U.S. consumer is facing the impact of tariff. While trade discussions are fluid, consumer demand could be impacted. Today, we are updating our fiscal 2019 sales and earnings per share growth guidance to reflect these changes. Remember that we guide off GAAP. So, fiscal 2019 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2018, which includes sales and earnings associated with the 53-week. For fiscal 2019, we now expect comp sales as calculated on a 52-week basis to increase by approximately 4%. That's down 100 basis points from the 5% growth rate we planned at the beginning of the year, reflecting for the most part, lower lumber prices, as well as some potential impact to the U.S. consumer from recently announced tariff. With this, we now expect sales to increase by approximately 2.3%, reflecting the compare to 53 weeks last year. We are also reaffirming our earnings per share growth guidance for fiscal 2019. For earnings per share, we expect fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 3.1% to $10.03. We are able to hold our earnings per share guidance to what we initially planned as lumber is a lower margin category, and because we are projecting a lower tax rate than our original plan. We thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, before we open the call up for questions, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, Carol Tom\u00e9 will be retiring as our CFO at the end of this month, after 24 years with the Company. She has served as our Chief Financial Officer for the past 18 years. And in fact, today\u2019s call is the 73rd consecutive quarter she has reported our financial results to the market. I\u2019d like to thank Carol for her deep commitment to our associates, the investment community and our shareholders. Carol has set the standard for excellence and transparency during these calls, reflecting not only her in-depth knowledge of our business, our operating environment, the economic environment, but also her dedication to our values. So, Carol, let me say thank you for your leadership and for your partnership, and your 24-year career at Home Depot. You\u2019ll definitely be missed. Christine?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Craig. And we\u2019ll try to get to your questions without me crying? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. \nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. That\u2019s a hard lead in to ask a question off of.\nCraig Menear: Sorry about that one.\nMichael Lasser: All good. Carol, congratulations and best of luck. And you too Richard, good luck in following in those very large footsteps.\nRichard McPhail: They certainly are.\nMichael Lasser: So, my first question is, we have assumed that about three quarters of the reduction in your full-year comp guidance is due to the lumber price changes and the remainder, so about a quarter of a comp point is due to the macro. There\u2019s obviously been a lot of concern on the macro recently, given the yield curve, inverting a large education institution that\u2019s calling for a significant slowdown in remodeling activity and then, as you pointed out, the tariff uncertainty. So, do you think a quarter point reduction in your comp guidance sufficiently considers all of those uncertainties?\nCraig Menear: So, Michael, let me make a couple of comments, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol. So, first of all, when you look at the overall macro factors that we think are critical to how we line up our business, those have largely remained unchanged. And so, we feel good about the fact that the consumer has wages up about 3% year-over-year, consumer confidence is still high. So, the general trend that we see in the macro base and how we did our plans really hasn\u2019t changed much. And we feel pretty good about that. And then, when you think about going forward in the business, when we looked at commodity, hurricane and May and then compared that to where we were at the end of the quarter, we feel good about the guidance that we have.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I\u2019ll give you little bit more color there, Michael. So, the implied back half comp in the guidance that we just gave you is around 5%. If you look at our reported comp in the second quarter in the U.S., it was a 3.1% comp. If you add back the impact of hurricane-related sales, that\u2019s 50 basis points of hurt. If you add back the weather-driven demand, softness that we saw in May, that was 40 basis points of hurt. And then, you heard us talk about commodity being 100 basis points. So, when you add that back, actually the normalized comp in the second quarter was 5%. Then, you heard us talk about the comp cadence and we exited July quite strong on an adjusted basis, the comp in the U.S was 4.7%. And then, I look at our -- how we are performing relative to plan, and we are on our plan. So, you add up all the data points and it suggests that comp guidance is very achievable. And the other way to look at it is just stack the comps. You stack the comps for the first half of this year against last year, stack the second half what we reported and what we are guiding to, the stack is about the same in most of the half. So, every way we look at it, we feel very good about the guidance that we\u2019ve given.\nCraig Menear: Michael, I guess the last comment that I\u2019d have on it, if the consumer softened in any way, I\u2019ll bet on this team all day long to go after the business.\nMichael Lasser: No doubt. And Carol, you mentioned you are on your plan, do you mean you are on your plan where you stand quarter-to-date, such that you really haven't seen any impact from the tariffs flowing through to the consumer as of yet?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: That\u2019s exactly what I mean. The beauty of our business is that we see sales on our phone; we can know exactly how we're doing by the minute. So, that\u2019s very different than that leading indicator of remodeling activity report that you just mentioned, which is based on a biannual survey of housing data coming out of that [ph]. We have real data at our fingertips. So, we feel good about the performance.\nMichael Lasser: You might want to remove that app by the end of the month. And then, my last question is on as you look at your guidance for the back half of the year, how should we model gross margin and SG&A, particularly between the third and the fourth quarter, recognizing that it\u2019s not so straight forward, given that you\u2019ll be lapping the extra week in the fourth quarter of last year? \nCarol Tom\u00e9: So, it\u2019s a relatively loopy [ph]. So, I -- talked to expenses, and as we told you, we expect our expenses on a 52-week to 52-week basis, excluding the write-down that we took for some trade names that we\u2019re no longer using. We told you that our expense growth factor would be 90% for the year. For the first half, it was around 73%. So, it will be a little bit higher in the back half, and quarter-over-quarter expect Q4 is higher than Q3. On the gross margin side, as we indicted, our gross margin -- it won\u2019t be as low as we had anticipated at the beginning of the year because of the penetration shift in lumber. So, we will be slightly higher than our original guide, our original guide was to be flat or that was at 34% for the year as you move forward. So, it won't be down as much. So, the second half margin will be down as much as the first half.\nMichael Lasser: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks again and best of luck.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And well done, Carol. Congratulations. My first question is on the second half. I know you don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, but can you can you share some cadence around the second half comp guidance, and its dependencies? And I'm thinking about macro dependencies and strategic initiatives. And if you can share with us part of it on the strategic initiatives, which ones are expected to contribute to the most for the second half comps?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Couple of things to think about when we think about the second half comp. First, as you know, we\u2019re lapping $800 million of hurricane-related sales of which $500 million occurred in the first half, $300 million in the back half. So, the hurricane sales overlap is easier. Secondly, on lumber price deflation, let's just use the number of $800 million to make it simple, about $500 million of that occurred in the first half, so $300 million will occur in the back half. So, it is easier too. Then, we have the impact\u2026\nCraig Menear: Yes. And so, on the initiatives, when you think about the Pro, first is the B2B website that we have launched. And we are seeing Pros that have been migrated onto a website, react very positively from a sales standpoint. We are on track for the 1 million Pros in 2019. As a matter of fact, at the tail end of this quarter, we added a significant number of Pros to the website. As Ted detailed, My View capability that we've given to our associates in store to better understand how we can engage with a Pro customer is delivering the results as well. And then, we've made significant investments in our rental business, which we know is an important aspect with the Pro. 25% of the Pros rent from us today; we know that 90% of Pro is rent tools. So, we have an opportunity as we invest in this business to continue to grow. And then, in the digital investments, our HD Home program, as we expand categories to fulfill rooms in the home, as well as the investments we're making in search capabilities, category updates are all leading to improved sales and conversion in the business. And then, the number of investments that we've made in the store as well, whether that's our overhead management, which is driving productivity in the store, or interconnected lockers, which is enhancing the pickup experience for our customers or our merchandising resets are paying off in a nice way. I don\u2019t know, do you want to give a little more color on the resets?\nTed Decker: Yes. On the resets, we've been working on our appliance resets and our tools sales for some time. Those two businesses continue to post incredibly strong results, and we don't see that changing in the back half. More recently, we've been working through our pipe isle reset, which is going extremely well through about half the chain this year and that adds holding power and room for some new assortment programs. And then, soft flooring, I mentioned in our prepared remarks, for a while there you thought, hey, is soft flooring losing all ground to hard surface flooring, what we\u2019ve seen in solid core vinyl and tile. But resetting all of our soft carpet showrooms, those are done. We simplified our brand structure. We simplified our line structure and pricing structures. That has continued to accelerate through the quarter and exited the quarter at much higher than the Company comp. So, we're happy with what we\u2019ve seen in soft flooring. And then, lastly, our largest reset to come, which we've just launched in the last several weeks, and will finish the entire chain by the end of this year, is our new color solution center in our paint department where we\u2019d be highlighting our Behr and PPG products, and really pleased with that. The timing couldn\u2019t be better. We read a number of recent consumer surveys and consumer testing agencies, release the new winners for this year and Behr captured the top three paint products in the entire industry at the best value, and PPG posted the two top stain products at the best value. So, we\u2019re very excited about all those resets.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And Craig, just to add a couple of points from just driving the customer experience as well. Number one, you mentioned rental. We\u2019re continuing to see growth accelerate from half to half. So, the investments we\u2019re making there are really driving exponential value. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to lean in there. To the points about driving the event in the second half, when we think about our comp cadence, we kind of talked about overhead management and/or ability to find the product and get on-shelf availability to a very, very high level is driving incremental performance. And for us, as we think about the investments, not only to getting the product on the shelf, is how do we get the customers to the store. So, we have done 450 frontend transformations. We have heard the numbers that we have seen, just the customer experience grow across the board. We\u2019re going to have over 800 by the end of the year. And so, we\u2019re able to deliver this performance by not only transforming our business, but making sure that our focus is simple and direct and drive into where the customer expects us to be. So, we\u2019ll continue to drive through that in the second half of the year and leverage the event to drive exponential depreciated performance.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you. That was very comprehensive. Can I -- I am going to ask my follow-up. A year ago, when rates were rising, we went through this hypothetical scenario, if we saw recession, I think we talked about the scenario in which Home Depot would comp flat and margins could go to 12, if you made all the investments as part of your plan. I think, we\u2019re now one year forward, you\u2019re making progress on margins, can you provide us another update, would your margin end up better than that 12, given that you\u2019re closer now to some of your goals?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, Simeon, we haven\u2019t updated that recession model. Productivity is a virtuous cycle at The Home Depot. But for modeling, purposes, I reviewed the same numbers that we shared with you before. And just on the sort of the state of the economy and when a recession might happen, we certainly can\u2019t predict that. But, we know a few things. We are in the longest economic recovery in our nation\u2019s history. And yet the amount of growth during this recovery is still under the average of every other recovery industry. So, this is one reason why it\u2019s been an elongated cycle. Further, share of housing as a percent of GDP has dropped, it\u2019s about 19% of GDP. Back in 2006, it was about 22% GDP. So, whenever that downturn comes and it will, it is a cyclical economy. But, whenever that downturn comes, it\u2019s not going to be like it was before. So, we\u2019re very well positioned to manage through all that.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you, again, and best of luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. I had another follow-up on the investments that you\u2019re making, despite the pretty comprehensive answer you already provided. Can you help us better understand the cadence of the comp growth improvement that you are expecting, both in the back half of this year and that flows into next year, specifically target to these investments.\nCraig Menear: What we said in earlier statements that we believe that we will achieve about a 1% impact in the back half of the year from the investments that we are making. When you took GDP, the housing benefit, and then added in the investments, that\u2019s how we got to our growth overall. And the only thing that changed from that for all practical purposes is the deflation of lumber.\nScot Ciccarelli: Just to clarify I think it was 1.4 for the year, all of which is kind of loaded into the back half or did I misunderstand that?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: You are right. It\u2019s loaded into the back half. And the way that we\u2019ve modeled it based on events as well as the completion of resets that you\u2019ve heard from Ted is that that the fourth quarter comp will be higher than third quarter, definitely.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. And we should presume because of the changes in the customer interaction, a lot of these improvements should flow into next year, or is there a point where you start to anniversary it and it levels off?\nCraig Menear: They\u2019ll definitely flow into next year. We will get to that guidance later in the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And I\u2019d certainly echo Craig\u2019s comments and whish you, Carol, a very best of fortune in the next phase of your life. In terms of my questions, just a follow-up on the macro, on the housing front, rates have moved around a lot, moved down quite a bit. I\u2019m about to reset perhaps personally, but pricing has moderated and existing home sales are not picking up. So, is that what you are expecting? And then, what are you seeing out there in terms of -- in the market, say, some of the coastal markets where we\u2019re -- that\u2019s really driving the deceleration in pricing and pricing coming down versus other parts of the country? And then, related to that on a consumer front, are you seeing anything different in the consumer around the type of projects that they're taking on or perhaps the trade-up versus the value orientation?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: On the macro model, yes, things are moving around a little bit, but it\u2019s just on the margin. So, there is no material change to the inputs that create the output and drive our sales plan. To your question about the coastal markets, I\u2019ll just give you some data. Let\u2019s take San Francisco down the coast; the cost was higher than the Company average. Let's take San Diego little further south; comp was at the Company average. Let's take New Jersey, which is a high south state, the comps were higher than the company average. And then, let\u2019s just land in Dallas. Dallas has seen a 54% increase in home prices since 2006 and it comped above the Company average. You can see things are performing the way that we thought they would.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then, a couple of detailed model questions. First, any comment on your expectation for the U.S. comp for the year versus the 4% total guide? And can you help us a little bit more about on the SG&A in 4Q? You give us 52-week to 52-week comparison, perhaps how much incremental SG&A dollars there were in 4Q \u201818 related to that 53rd week?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I don\u2019t feel good about answering those questions because we don\u2019t like to give you too much quarterly information....\nCraig Menear: So, the one comment I\u2019d make as it relates to kind of the year, we're expecting positive comps in Canada for the year, if that helps.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: The question is what happens to the U.S. dollar, and we plan it currency neutral. So, you can model what you think is going to happen to the dollar and do that calculation. So, on the expense side on a reported basis, because of the extra week that expenses growth guidance on a GAAP basis looked really bloated. [Ph] And that's the only way to explain it It\u2019s going to look really bloated. We're going to ignore that extra week. I think the best thing to do is just work within the annual guidance that we\u2019ve given you, look at it on a daily 52-week to 52-week basis, and you can back into what the fourth quarter looks like.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Grom: So, the front half of the year has not been kind on the weather front, we all know that at this point. I'm just curious, in the past, when you've seen this type of pattern, you typically see the release of that demand, or do some of the projects just get postponed or cancelled altogether?\nCraig Menear: It's by category. So there's some categories that have the ability to extend and we're seeing that in the business right now. And so, you capture that. There are some where you don't recover all of that business. You might get part of it, but not all of it. So, it really varies by category. So, if you think about, depending on when the weather takes place, you may or may not get pre-emergent business back, for example, and this year, we didn't get that back.\nCharles Grom: And then, just on the change in the comp guide. When you look ahead to your -- the long-term sales targets of $114.7 billion to I believe around $120 billion. I'm just wondering, if that changes that outlook at all, or maybe perhaps bring it to the lower end of the algo equation?\nCraig Menear: Yes. It definitely goes to the lower end. But, it doesn't change the range of guidance.\nCharles Grom: Okay. And then, just one follow-up on the gross margins, Carol. All of last year, transportation was a pretty big headwind. You didn't call it out this quarter. I don't believe you called it out last quarter. I was just curious, if it's actually helping you guys at this point?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, it certainly has moderated from what we saw last year. What we are very excited about is the productivity that we\u2019re seeing in our upstream supply chain. Our supply chain team has done a great job of mechanizing our upstream facilities. We actually -- well, I called out 2 basis points of pressure in the gross margin comps -- supply chain upstream. Upstream, we leveraged, we leveraged 6 basis points. So, tremendous, we leverage productivity in supply chain.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Craig, you specifically called out some conservatism in your guide from the potential impact of tariffs. Curious if you could quantify the assumptions here in a little more detail. Maybe talk us through how you think about the balance in the back half of raising prices and the potential downtick in volumes as a result.\nCraig Menear: Yes. I mean, the uncertainty is what the total impact on the customers economically overall. When we look at it specifically as it relates to Home Depot, if you think about China tariffs list one through four, four being at 10%, that's about a $2 billion or 2% of sales cost impact. And so, the way you have to think about tariffs is there's really two sides that you work on this. There's the actual cost side and there is a number of initiatives underway there, and then, there is the potential of the impact to the customers that relates to the project. And, I can -- I\u2019ll let Ted talk about the cost side. And we have a number of initiatives underway as it relates to how we flow things through to the customer. We use our portfolio approach. We think about this business as a project business, which it is. And there\u2019s clearly ups and downs and elasticity, but we have pretty good tools for merchants to use on that. And we\u2019ve actually been able to cover the top line. Ted, if you want to talk about the cost side?\nTed Decker: Yes. I\u2019d say on the cost side, I couldn\u2019t be happier with our partnership with finance team, the accounting team, our assortment planning team. We have data of country, of origin in potential tariff impact literally down to skew. So, we know exactly what are on various lists, when the tariff impacts will hit. We even know that through our retail accounting into when the impacts hit in our P&L. So, thank you very much to the great partnership with the finance team. As Craig said, on a macro perspective, through phase 4, and phase 4 only being a 10%, it\u2019s a potential impact of about 2% of our U.S. sales. Now, with a number of activities that we\u2019re working with the merchants between negotiations with our supplier base taking into account things like currency, trends for pricing in the United States, value engineering, we\u2019re embarking upon with our suppliers, with customer-backed research if you have marginal dollar to put into the product, where you put it, the best customer value. And then, we\u2019re starting to see significant supply chain. I would say, on the margin, I'm not aware of a single supplier who is not moving some form of manufacturing outside of China. So, we have suppliers moving production to Taiwan, to Vietnam, to Thailand, Indonesia and even back into the United States. So, when you net all of that out, we see this 2ish-percent impact being much, much less, call it something like 1%. And then, as Craig said, it\u2019s up to the merchant team to work with our overall portfolio approach to the business and project approach to the business to see how best if at all, there we pass on any of those net impacts to our customers.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And then, on the paint category, it seems to have gotten a little more promotional so far this year. Could we talk through some of the dynamics here? What do you think has driven the elevated activity, more so overall demand or weather environment? And maybe also talk through your process when deciding how you respond when you typically see changes out there in the pricing environment?\nCraig Menear: So, first I\u2019d answer with exterior stains. So, Behr is the -- the weather improved and we did the reset quickly last year and much more comprehensively this year, again with the number one and number two graded exterior stain with PPG product. We saw great performance in our exterior stain business. On interior paint, interior paint has gotten more promotional in the marketplace. We have folks out there advertising in print and on media as much as 40% off. At Home Depot, we have, as was just released with the third party agencies, we have the absolute best paint in marketplace. Behr paint holds the top three slots in its ratings in two different surveys. And we are not going to fall into a high-low promotional trap when we have the best product at the best everyday value. And as you know in the finance community, just speaking of promotional cadence, I can remember there was a lot of talk about breaking the buck in the money market world. And we had a 3 times a year promotional cadence in paint of $10 off a gallon and $40 off 5 gallons in the major holidays of the year. Some of our competitors chose to break the buck, and we're not going to do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \nKaren Short: Just a question on tariffs in general. So, I think, last quarter you commented that on price, raising prices as it relates to tariff impacted pricing, you initially had negative units on appliances and then demand picked up a bit. Maybe a little color on what you are seeing in terms of the consumer reaction to higher price points? And then, I just had a clarification question on the gross margin.\nCraig Menear: As we -- as I mentioned, we have number of models that we are working right now. And it varies by category. There is elasticity variance by category, and that changes over time as well. And the work that we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve been able to actually cover the total top line sales in the models that we have out there. And when you think about laundry because we have referenced that from the past, as time has gone by, laundry was actually our highest unit comping category in appliances last quarter.\nKaren Short: Interesting, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, on the gross margin front, I mean, obviously, lumber would have been a benefit to gross margin this quarter. Could you quantify that and then help walk us through how lumber may impact gross margin in the second half?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I\u2019m happy to. With the lower penetration of lumber in the second quarter, it gave us 15 basis points of margin expansion. But, that was absorbed by growth in lower margin categories, like appliances as well as portable power. We love our portable power sales, but we don\u2019t make a lot of money on it. So...\nTed Decker: It started recovery, in general. \nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you. Absolutely, Ted. Thank you for that. So, as we look to the back half of the year, we would expect lumber to stay down as we\u2019ve talked about, not much as you saw in the first half, but down, which will give us some benefit for the back half as well for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Forbes: I wanted to revisit the tool rental business and really what you expect the B2B website experience to augment this initiative? As I sort of think about it, maybe you could just expand on how you view the interplay between those two initiatives and the potential impact of Pro engagement trends. You mentioned sort of positive, but can you provide some additional color?\nCraig Menear: So, I\u2019d say, first comment I make, I'll turn it over to Ann, is right now, our issues aren\u2019t around necessarily connecting the B2B website to that from a digital experience. That will come at a later date. This is all about the investments that we're making right now in the physical locations.\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Yes. And just to support, Craig, on that. Number one, the first thing we're doing investing capital in the business. To your point, there's -- when we invest in fleet, we\u2019re able to drive more engagement with the Pro, because we have product available. So that's the first thing we're doing is making sure that we have the right assortment for Pro. The number two thing we're doing there as well to drive the experience. We've had just tremendous success with the label model we introduced in the stores last year and it was able to drive higher level of engagement by having our associates there at the right time to engage our customer. And so, we're going to continue to lean into that. And within the two rental areas, we're also making sure that we're addressing our label model to ensure as well that we are having a high level of engagement as well there. And then, last but not least, as we think about how do we ensure that we expand our offering, and we're able to push into areas at this point to delivery service and so forth, we're exploring hub locations for tool rental as well. So, we're going to continue to push there. We're seeing tremendous growth. We\u2019re seeing higher levels of engagement. And we believe as we continue to expand, it will certainly be a complement for Pros and drive loyalty within the Home Depot.\nSteve Forbes: Thank you. And then, just a quick follow-up, maybe just a modeling question here. You called out the strategic investment, dollar impact for the quarter and year-to-date. But, are you still on track to expense, I think it was $550 million for D&A for the year. Maybe just give us an update on where you are and what the full-year outlook incorporates?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. We are on our plan with regard to both the expense and capital in support of our strategic investments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Sigman: I wanted to follow up on deflation. You discussed the lumber impact. I'm just curious about net deflation, if there were any positive commodity price movements. And I guess just how are you thinking about that as part of the new full-year comp guidance?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: So, lumber deflation, I said was 110 basis points. And then, we had another 10 basis points of inflation, if you will, from the other commodities categories that we call out from time to time. \nSeth Sigman: And then, ex the deflation, your average ticket actually accelerated in the quarter versus last quarter. So, I guess outside of commodities, how do we think about the average price increase that you're seeing across the store, I guess, on a same SKU basis? And then, tying it in with the gross margin to the extent that you are seeing higher retail prices, is that a benefit to the gross margin initially until the higher costs actually start to flow through cogs, like how we do think about that? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: So, on the price side, and I'll let Ted give details. The innovation that comes into the assortments, certainly has a positive impact overall on our business as it relates to the ticket.\nTed Decker: Yes. And I would say from taking aside lumber and tariffs, from a pure commodity standpoint, we had quite a bit of pressure on back half of last year, first part of this year that subsided. So, commodity prices generally versus a year ago, if you think of steel, resin, base metals et cetera are actually down. So, that pressure on the outfit has subsided. To Craig\u2019s point, most of our pricing increases are mix-driven in the sense that customers are trading up to more innovative, higher price goods, we break out the components of our average unit retail increase, which has increased. By far the largest driver of that in Q2 as well as the past several quarters is from new product introductions which are higher price points because of innovation, think of cordless lawnmowers versus push gas mowers. On tariffs, we have a number of tests going on across the country, nothing of any sort of magnitude to say in the quarter, we\u2019re taking price broadly at this point because of tariffs. But we are testing a number of things in our mixes and portfolio approach across the country.\nCraig Menear: And to your question, impact to margin. As we sell more innovative product and the customer steps themselves lot off that line structure it drives a higher gross margins dollar. It may not change rate, but it drives the higher gross margin dollar, which is what the most important thing is.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And we\u2019re probably not giving you the information that maybe you wanted, but I think it\u2019s been an interest statistics to look at the acceleration in our big ticket. This has been underlying sign of health in the business. This is unadjusted. Big ticket grew 1.5% in May, 4.1% in June and 5.3% in July. \nSeth Sigman: Okay. Thank you for the color. I appreciate it.\nIsabel Janci: And Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: I made it in. So, Carol, thank you. It really, really helped through all the years. And you enjoy all the break you get, we\u2019ll continue to annoy you as best we can. I had a follow-up on tariffs and inflation and then also digital. If -- that description you gave before of list 1 to 4, does that assume a 10% tariff on everything, a 25% or is it 25% on lists 1 to 3 and then the potential 10 on list 4?\nCraig Menear: Yes. That\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s the 25 of 1 through 3 and then 10 on 4.\nGreg Melich: Perfect. And so, to tie into that, is that a reason why inventories might have been up 5% year-over-year, a contributing factor?\nCraig Menear: No, our inventory is all about the investments that we\u2019re making in the accelerated resets for the large part. So, it has nothing to do with that.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then, last on digital. I know up 20% continues to grow nicely. Is that around 9% of sales? And it did decelerate. So, I'm wondering, did Amazon\u2019s move to next day, did you see any impact on that? And do you think that was the factor in the deceleration or is there something else going on?\nCraig Menear: No. We actually were very pleased with our growth; it\u2019s 8.9% penetration in the quarter, up from 7.5% a year ago. And we\u2019ve actually accelerated our capabilities in same day delivery. Mark, I don\u2019t know if you want to share the details on that? \nMark Holifield: Yes. As was noted earlier, we have expanded our next day parcel coverage. We\u2019re over 50% of the population now in next day parcel coverage. We\u2019ve expanded our car delivery also to greater than 50% out of our stores. So, we\u2019re pleased with the time we\u2019re taking out of our lead time to customer. We continue to take lead time out with every move we make in the supply chain, and each time we do, it improves conversion.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Just on the point on deceleration, it\u2019s a fiscal calendar shift thing. So, that\u2019s not a comp number; that\u2019s a growth number.\nOperator: Ms. Janci, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call in November.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-05-21 15:00:06", "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Home Depot First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear, Chairman, CEO and President; Ted Decker, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Carol Tom\u00e9, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Services.

Before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me take a moment if you would of personal privilege. As you've read, at the end of April, we announced that Carol has decided to retire as our Chief Financial Officer and EVP of Corporate Services effective August 31, after 24 years of service to the Home Depot. This month, in fact, marks her 18th anniversary as our CFO, making her one of the longest tenured CFOs in the Fortune 100. And while I have more to say about Carol's numerous contributions to the Home Depot, as we get closer to her actual retirement, I did want to note on today's call Carol's extraordinary financial stewardship of our company. Richard McPhail, who will become our CFO in September, will indeed have big shoes to fill. And Carol, I can't thank you enough for your service to our company and to our shareholders.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you, Craig.\nCraig Menear: Sales for the first quarter were $26.4 billion, up 5.7% from last year. Comp sales were up 2.5% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 3%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.27 in the first quarter. Our sales performance came in below our expectations in the quarter, as a result of two factors: First, the month of February was the second wettest on record for the U.S. Second, lumber prices continued to decline in the quarter, resulting in a negative impact to sales growth of approximately $200 million. Looking at our results geographically, all of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps. Two of our 19 U.S. regions posted mid-single-digit negative comps as they faced difficult compares due to hurricane-related sales a year ago. Internationally, Mexico posted another quarter of positive comps in local currency, while Canada's comps were slightly negative. This, no doubt, was a noisy quarter, but when you look through the noise to the core business, we are pleased with the underlying performance. We saw growth in both ticket and transactions in the quarter, and 10 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps. Ted will provide additional details around departments that were negative in the quarter as hurricane comparison and price deflation impacted several categories. What I remain excited about is the progress we're making with regards to our strategic investment priorities. These investments enable us to continue to grow share in a highly fragmented $600 billion addressable market. We are making these investments from a position of strength as the number one retailer in home improvement. Every investment was formed using a customer-backed approach to create a truly seamless, frictionless customer experience that will drive results not just over the next several years, but for the long term. Our strategic efforts to drive and enhance interconnected customer experience through investments in both the physical and digital worlds are yielding solid returns. Online traffic growth was healthy and first quarter online sales grew 23% from the first quarter of 2018. We continue to use our digital platforms to lean into adjacent categories like HD Home, pool and even workwear where the customer has told us that we have the right to compete for an additional share of their wallet. For the consumer, we are investing in new category experiences that make it easier for a customer to shop their full project needs online. If a customer is redoing a bathroom and decides on a particular type and finish of faucet, chances are they probably want to see the full suite of matching bath faucets for vanity, shower and tub. In order to take friction out of this process, we are now rolling the ability to shop a collection using minimal clicks. While we are investing to address the unique demands of the digital customer experience, we know that our customers continue to value the relevancy of our stores as seen in increased number of customer transactions in the quarter. Additionally, approximately 54% of our online U.S. orders were picked up in our stores during the quarter, a testament to our interconnected strategy. During the quarter, we continued to make progress, enhancing this interconnected customer experience by investing in our stores to improve our front-end checkout experience, continuing to roll out automated lockers, streamlining our customer service desks, and simplifying tools for our associates. This has translated to reduced wait times and increased customer satisfaction as our customer service scores and checkout time satisfaction have increased over 500 basis points versus last year. Not only do these front-end investments have customer service and productivity benefits, they are also helping us to optimize store layouts to maximize merchandising space productivity in high traffic event and lay-down areas. Another key focus area from an investment standpoint is our Pro customer, which, once again, outpaced the DIY customer in the quarter. Pros tell us that they are busier than ever. This is why investing in a portfolio of offerings to help them manage their businesses efficiently and remove friction from their shopping experience are critical. Having the brands that pros care about in-stock with job-lot quantities is table stakes. You have to have that to serve them. But the value proposition that we are creating for the Pro through various investments over the next several years is, as we believe, unique to the marketplace. We continue to onboard Pro customers to our new B2B website experience, adding 35,000 customers in the quarter for a total of 135,000 customers that have been migrated to this experience so far. Our plan is to onboard over 1 million customers by the end of this year. Though it is early days, we are seeing increased engagement, which translates into increased spend. We also continue to make traction with the investments in other capabilities like tool rental , for example. We know that 90% of Pros rent tools. But several years ago, only about 1 out of 10 pros rented from us. Today, that number has improved to 1 out of 4, yet there remains opportunity for further growth as we continue to invest in our tool rental experience. We know that when Pros rent tools from us, their spend increases. Again, the theme here is about driving engagement. The more dimensional the relationship is with our Pro customers, the more they spend. This is a time of transformational change in the business as we execute our One Home Depot strategy. Our team continues to focus on what is most important, our customers. We hired 80,000 new associates for spring, and thanks to our new in-aisle mobile training solution, PocketGuide, they have product knowledge at their fingertips to help them get up to speed quickly. Our merchants, store MET teams, supplier partners, and supply chain teams did an outstanding job of delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter. I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication, hard work and commitment to our customers. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks Craig, and good morning everyone. As Craig mentioned, while we worked through the noise of the first quarter we were pleased with how the business performed. Looking at our departments, comps in appliances, indoor garden, decor tools, outdoor garden, building materials, plumbing and hardware were above the company average. Paint and kitchen bath were positive, but below the company average. Millwork and flooring were slightly negative in large part due to hurricane overlaps. Our electrical lighting department reported a low single-digit negative comp due primarily to light bulbs. Commodity deflation were up high single-digit negative comps [indiscernible]. In the first quarter, comp average ticket increased 2% and comp transactions increased 5.5%. During the first quarter, we continued to see significant deflationary trends in lumber that began last year. Let me give you an example. When lumber prices peaked last year, we were selling a 4x8 sheet of OSB for approximately $17 and our units were negative. At the end of the first quarter, the price for that same sheet of OSB have fallen over 50% to about $8. While we have seen nicely in productivities prices have fallen. We have not overcome the top line headwind from the significant deflation. Without lumber price deflation, our average ticket growth would have been closer to 3%. During the first quarter big ticket comp transactions for those over $1,000, which represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales were up 3.9%, reflecting in part the impact of last year's hurricane related sales. Excluding hurricane related markets, big ticket comps were up approximately 5.1%. Wet weather in February also had a significant impact to our big ticket performance in the quarter, as big ticket comps were flat in the month of February. And finally, lumber price deflation also had a negative impact. We continue to see strong performance in big ticket categories like vinyl plank flooring, water heaters and appliances. And just to comment on appliances, as a result of our supply chain initiatives and working more closely with our partners, we are seeing improved customer satisfaction scores in appliance delivery. During the first quarter, we saw a growth with both our Pro and do-it-yourself customers. Pros are complex customers. And we are investing in a number of different initiatives and services to help our Pros get their jobs done. One of these services is our tool rental business. We have the largest number of tool rental centers in North America with approximately 1,100 locations inside our conveniently located stores. As Craig mentioned, we know that approximately 90% of Pros rent tools, but only one in four of our Pros rent tools from us. We also know that when Pros start renting tools from us, they see a significant uptick in their overall Home Depot stand. As part of our multi-year investment plan we are investing in more space, more tools and better technology to improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering. In addition to our Pro investments, we continue to invest across our interconnected platforms. During the first quarter, we had record quarterly online business that helped drive 23% growth in our online business. As we continue to invest in the online experience and reduce friction, we see higher traffic and improved conversion rates. In addition to enhanced site functionality, we are also expanding certain online assortments. At our investor conference in 2017, we talked to you about HD Home our expansion in home decor. We continue to lean into this category by offering a wide assortment of great values and we are seeing strong growth. We are also expanding our online assortments in categories like auto, pool and work wear, natural extensions to our in-store assortments. We are excited about the growth we are seeing from brands like Weather Guard, Hayward and Carhartt. Now let's turn our attention to the second quarter. We are thrilled to announce the launch of the DEWALT ATOMIC 20-volt compact series exclusive to The Home Depot. These compact tools offer the same 20-volt cordless power as traditional 20-volt tools in a smaller more versatile platform. The DEWALT Atomic series complements our already successful lineup of compact and subcompact power tools from Milwaukee and Makita. The Milwaukee 12-volt program is a favorite for mechanical trades, while the subcompact Makita 18-volt lineup offers the most power and torque in its class. In the big-box channel, these DEWALT Milwaukee and Makita tools can only be found at The Home Depot. We are excited about new product offerings across all of our categories in our upcoming events. During the second quarter, we will host our Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events, where we will be offering more great values and special buys for our customers. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you Ted, and good morning everyone. Before we discuss our first quarter results, I want to mention that at the beginning of fiscal 2019, we adopted ASU number 2016-02, which pertains to how we account for leases. The adoption of this standard impacted our balance sheet, but it did not materially impact our income statement or statement of cash flows. Under this new standard operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are now reflected on our balance sheet. With that let's move on to our first quarter results. In the first quarter, total sales were $26.4 billion, a 5.7% increase from last year. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted the total sales growth by approximately $76 million or 0.3%. Recall that for our first quarter comp calculation, we are comparing weeks one through 13 of fiscal 2019 against weeks two through 14 of fiscal 2018. Our total company comps were positive 2.5% for the quarter with negative comps of 2% in February, positive comps of 5.6% in March and positive comps of 3.2% in April. Comps in the U.S. were positive 3% for the quarter with negative comps of 1.9% in February, positive comps of 6.1% in March, and positive comps of 4% in April. The cadence of our monthly comps was a bit distorted by the Easter shift this year. Adjusting for the timing of Easter, our U.S. comps were 4.5% in March and 5.3% in April. As you heard from Craig, our first quarter sales growth missed our expectations driven primarily by two notable factors. First, weather had a negative impact on our February performance. To put the February weather impact into perspective, 17 of our 19 U.S. regions reported negative comps in February. By the end of the quarter, however, only two regions reported negative comps. And that was due to hurricane-related overlaps. Second, versus last year, lumber price deflation hurt our sales growth by approximately $200 million. If you ignore the weather impact of February across our business and lumber price deflation, our total company comp would have been closer to 4.5%. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.2%, a decrease of 36 basis points from last year. The year-over-year change in our gross margin reflects the following factors. First, the change in mix of products sold caused approximately 17 basis points of gross margin contraction. Second, higher shrink than one year ago resulted in 13 basis points of contraction. And finally, higher supply chain and fulfillment expense caused approximately six basis points of gross margin contraction. In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 44 basis points to 20.5%. Our operating expense performance reflects the impact of our strategic investment plan and ongoing expense control. Specifically, expenses related to our strategic investment plan of $229 million reflect a $50 million increase over last year and approximately 15 basis points of operating expense deleverage. This deleverage was offset by productivity in BAU or business-as-usual expenses, which drove 59 basis points of operating expense leverage. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 13.6%, an increase of 8 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the first quarter grew by $34 million to $273 million, due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than one year ago. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4% compared to 23.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Our first quarter tax rate was higher than last year due to certain state tax settlements that did not repeat. For the year we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%, in line with our guidance. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $2.27, an increase of 9.1% from last year. Now moving on to some additional highlights. During the quarter, we opened two net new stores for an ending store count of 2,289. Selling square footage at the end of the quarter was 238 million square feet. Total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $435, up 5.6% from last year. At the end of the quarter, inventory turns were 4.7 times, down from 4.9 times last year, reflecting growth in inventory to accelerate merchandising resets, as well as an early load-in for spring sales. For the year, we expect our inventory turns to be flat to what we reported in fiscal 2018. Moving on to capital allocation. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 6.5 million shares of outstanding stock. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.4%, 940 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Turning to the remainder of the year. Our view on the U.S. economy and the drivers of home improvement spend are not fundamentally different from what we shared with you back in February. First quarter U.S. GDP growth was strong. Unemployment is the lowest it has been in nearly six decades and wages are rising. The relevant housing metrics that drive home improvement spending, notably home price appreciation, existing home turnover, household formation and the age of the housing stock continue to be supportive of our outlook. And as you heard from Craig, as expected, we are seeing benefit from our strategic investments. The building blocks of our 2019 plan are in place. Nonetheless, two factors have changed since we put their plan together. First, there was a recent announcement that certain tariffs are increasing to 25%. We are working through the impact of these tariffs and as a result have not included them in today's guidance. Second and more immediate, is the significant deflation we are seeing in lumber prices. You will recall that our sales forecasting model does not include commodity price inflation or deflation. If lumber prices remain at today's level, this could hamper our fiscal 2019 sales growth plan by as much as $800 million. But because we cannot predict what will happen to lumber prices and because we are just one quarter into the year, at this point we are not changing our sales or earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2019. With that in mind, today we are reaffirming the sales and earnings per share growth guidance that we laid out on our fourth quarter earnings call. Remember that we guide off GAAP, so fiscal 2019 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2018, which includes sales and earnings associated with the 53rd week. When we report our quarterly comp sales results, we will compare weeks one through 52 in fiscal 2019 against weeks two through 53 in fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, we expect comp sales, as calculated on a 52-week basis, to increase by approximately 5%. We expect sales to increase by approximately 3.3%, reflecting the compare of 53 weeks last year. For earnings per share, we expect fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 3.1% to $10.03. Our earnings per share guidance includes our plan to repurchase approximately $5 billion of outstanding shares during the year. So we thank you for your participation in today's call and we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me?\nCraig Menear: Good morning. Yes.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. Good morning.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Good morning. Sorry about that. Carol, congratulations and good luck. My first question is -- I have -- it's two parts, so don't count this as my follow-up.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: We won't.\nSimeon Gutman: I realize you don't give quarterly guidance. But for this context, I think, it's helpful if you can share with us what the internal expectation for Q1 was and how much it underperformed? And I appreciate you made the 4.5% comment ex-weather, ex-lumber. Because are you making up 50, 100 basis points for the year? And I get -- it sounds like lumber could end up being around a 70 basis point headwind. And then the second part of that is, if it is mostly weather, do we think about you making most of it up in the second quarter and a little in the third, but we leave the fourth quarter alone?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well, thank you for your questions, Simeon. As you point out, we normally don't provide our quarterly plan, but I will tell you that our plan for the first quarter of 2019 was a comp of 4.5%. So if you look through the weather noise in February, as well as the lumber deflation, we were very pleased with our first quarter results. The other thing that I will remind you all of is that, we are comping this year $800 million of hurricane-related sales. $500 million of those hurricane-related sales took place in the first quarter of last year. So our compares get much easier as we look to the back half of the year.\nSimeon Gutman: Right. I guess...\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Now, to the question about weather, and will we cover it. This is very different than what we saw a year ago in the first quarter, which was very much an April story that impacted our garden department. The weather in February impacted our business. 17 of 19 regions were negative. The majority of our selling departments were negative. Our transactions were negative 2.5% for the month of February alone. Our big-ticket was flat in the month of February. Those sales are coming back as the weather improves. Part of those sales are related to our Pro customer and we understand from our pros that they have backlogs that are in excess of 90 days. So those sales will come into the second quarter and continue into the third quarter. That's what gives us confidence to reaffirm the guidance of a 5% comp for the year, albeit there is lumber price deflation and it continues into May actually. If we look through lumber price deflation our May results are performing as we expected. But we thought it was important to get that lumber price deflation number out there for you, because we can't predict. Too early in the year to know what's going to happen to lumber prices, but we thought we should give you the number.\nSimeon Gutman: Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just to clarify and this will be the follow-up, it -- so you initially guided the back half. I think it was about 250 basis points stronger than the first half and you've made the case around hurricane, I think you just said $800 million, at least in the first half of this year and then now we have lumber. And so, that doesn't -- I think if we do the math, that doesn't leave as much of a spike as far as other initiatives go, as far as the pickup that's required in the back half. Is that fair? And maybe can you just quantify what is outside? What needs to happen from the business to get stronger outside from the lapping of weather and now unfortunately, I guess, lumber deflation?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: So just as a point of clarification on the hurricanes, it\u2019s $800 million for the year, $500 million in the first half, $300 million in the back half. So, clearly, the hurricane compares get much easier in the back half. As we look at the shape of the year today, we would expect that the back half comps to be more than 2 times the first half comps, principally because of those hurricane compares, but more importantly because of the initiatives that we are investing into, one of those initiatives being the B2B website that we've talked to you about. And Craig maybe you want to talk about what we're seeing, or Bill Lennie, what we're saying with the B2B website?\nCraig Menear: Yes. We're actually very pleased. I'll let Bill jump in here. We added 35,000 customers in the quarter, and we expect to have 1 million customers up by the end of the year.\nBill Lennie: Yes. Simeon, we're migrating customers as new website capabilities come onboard. I'll give you just a few examples of the capabilities we added in Q1. We added an administrator in user hierarchy, which allows administrators or account owners to add purchasers or users. We also now allow customers to easily link their purchases to QuickBooks and upload their purchase history. Then we also made localization much easier. Our Pro customers shop across multiple cities, multiple stores. This allows them to save their stores they shop and easily localize their purchases. And then in Q2, next up, we'll enable the Pro purchase card which is our legacy Interlink customer shopping in Home Depot stores. They'll be able to use their Pro purchase card online and they'll have their purchases attributed back to their account. We'll make buy it again easier for them. It will be an auto-populated page based on their recent purchase history, both in-store and online. And then we have a redesigned homepage coming up that's going to be based on our feedback from Test & Target on 1,500 customers that just more personalizes that experience makes it easier for them to transact. So, it is early days. It's too early to comment on sales lift, but the experience that we're delivering is all about engagement like Craig said. And we know the more that we take friction out of the ability to transact the more our customers engage. So, early days but pleased with the capabilities, pleased with the results that we're seeing from the customers that are active.\nSimeon Gutman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions and Carol congratulations and best wishes. There's not enough nice things we can say. Thank you for everything. With sales coming in below your expectations in 1Q and some of the challenges lingering into 2Q, at what point in the year do you start to see downside risk to the full year guidance if sales do not improve? Is that window as soon as June or July? Or do you think even if 2Q is softer than you expect you can maintain that full year 5% comp expectation?\nCraig Menear: Michael we'll have to see how the second quarter actually plays out as it relates to lumber. Clearly, when you look at the first quarter the two big impacts were the situation in February where really it was pretty horrible across the country in that lumber. And if you think about lumber for a minute I'll let Ted get into some of the feedback that we're hearing from our suppliers. But lumber has a lot of factors. And when you think about -- we won't know until we see what the environment is and what the storm situation may look like this year. It's predicted to be another potentially active year. That could change a lot of things but we're also hearing some information from our suppliers.\nTed Decker: Yes. So, on lumber the situation this year is really the exact opposite of last year. So, last year the mills had a shortage of logs and we had some early housing activities, so lumber prices went to all-time highs. Those peaked at toward the end of May of 2018. This year the mills were able to harvest their logs. They had a tremendous amount of inventory on the log decks. And at the same time with the wet February, we had the slow start to housing. So, it's an exact opposite year. And so prices have fallen in some categories as I've said OSB as much as 50%. So, what we're hearing now is the mills are working through their backlog of logs. The mills have not been able to curtail earlier in this year because you've got to process the logs as they get wet and soggy. They've worked through a lot of that backlog and we're starting to see some of the first curtailments. But again it's very early days. We're going to need to see a rebound in spring in housing, construction. That's where lumber prices are set on the margin in the distributor channel not the retail channel. Our units are terrific. Given our units we'll be expecting to see lumber prices going up.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Exactly.\nTed Decker: But unfortunately the price is set at the margin through the wholesale distribution which has a lot more to do with housing starts. So, as weather clears up, mills curtail logs get worked there is promise for the back of the year. So, that's why again we laid out the risk but haven't called it.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. And recognizing -- and putting aside the lumber deflation recognizing that your model is heavily influenced by overall GDP growth and home price appreciation if you look at any of your sales by category, are any of them showing a correlation to housing turnover? There is evidence that some of your specialty competitors in areas like flooring are exhibiting weakness in a pretty tight correlation to housing turnover. So, if you're not seeing that why do you think that is the case?\nCraig Menear: I mean we look -- on a continual basis, we look at discretionary categories. And we don't see a direct correlation to any movement in discretionary categories. As a matter of fact you think -- look at things like closet organization which is purely discretionary and we feel good about those kinds of businesses. There has clearly been a shift in the flooring business to vinyl which has had some impact on some other categories, but we don't see anything right now that would indicate a change.\nMichael Lasser: So, Craig even though housing turnover's been under considerable amount of pressure over the last several months, it's not having an impact on any real category within your portfolio despite the fact that in the past it's been a pretty influential driver of the overall business?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes, Michael you've just written a report on this which was really helpful that there's been a disconnect between housing turnover and sales performance. And we went back in and tried to correlate turnover to our departments to see if there was any correlation and we couldn't see it. Now, our flooring department was one of our slower-growing departments in the quarter, but that isn't a correlated housing turnover. We think we have some opportunities within the mix.\nTed Decker: Yes. The dynamic in flooring and these things are trends and trends will reverse themselves. We saw a meaningful shift to hard surface flooring over the past several years that went into tile that then went into wood-look tile with not rectangular or not square, but more rectangular shape. And then the last couple of years luxury vinyl plank arrived on the scene. And it's an incredibly innovative product because you can put it below subfloors. It's waterproof. It's unbelievably easy to lie. You don't obviously have to get tile set material. You don't have to level floors. It's so much faster for our Pros. So, we've had unbelievable growth in the last three years and it just continues. That all-in is a lower price point lower all-in basket because you're not getting set materials grout et cetera. It's certainly less expensive for the Pro to lay. So, that's part of the mix shift that Carol is talking about. That's not to say that there isn't still plenty of demand for soft surface in tile, in wood, in laminate. And we need to do a better job responding on our mix in those categories as we put a lot of emphasis on the plank and we've got some work to do on mix in the other categories.\nMichael Lasser: That's very helpful. And Carol congrats again.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks and good morning and my congratulations to you as well Carol. I think you're -- I started following your company in 2003 and I think you're the last remaining C-suite person. So, congratulations in obviously just a tremendous career. My question -- my first question is at the start of the year you mentioned that the first half would be 350 bps below on a comp basis, but the second half -- first or the second half but the -- on a stack basis relatively flat. You do lap a big May a year ago on the seasonal shift. Should we think about 2Q on a two-year stack basis? Or we do -- do we do a little better considering that the shift to the Pro that you talked about out of February until later than the year presumably you had planned May down given the compare?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: I think the easiest way to think about Q2 is that the comp rate should be higher than what we reported in the first quarter because the stacking gets a little confusing because of the calendar shift. And if I could change the calendar shift, trust me I would. I wish I could have done that before because it just confuses that kind of thing. But I would just think that's the easiest way to think about the -- your model.\nChristopher Horvers: Okay. And do you have a sense of like shifting that to weeks two to 14 last year? Obviously you flow that through the top line impact, but presumably the compare -- the comparison itself was harder than what you would -- what you reported last year. So, is there -- have you been able to quantify or you looked at that in terms of what 1Q would have looked like a year ago if you had 2 to 14 in the comp base \u2013 in the comp in calendar?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yeah. So, if \u2013 yeah, if we hadn't shifted the calendar our un-shifted comps would have been 5.8% and I can give that to you by month, if you'd like. The un-shifted comp for February 2.6%, for March 5.5% and for April 8.1%.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Then as a follow-up on lumber deflation that obviously impact sales. But do you maintain gross margin \u2013 does margin rate sort of work in the opposite direction such that while you lose sales are gross profit dollars roughly the same? So in other words, if there is risk around deflation it seems like is that more of a top line risk but not necessarily a bottom line risk?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: It's a top line risk, because margin is one of our lowest \u2013 lumber is one of our lowest-margin category. A lower penetration of a lower-margin category is good for the gross margin. So while we called out the risk to the top line, if lumber prices stay where they are today, we didn't call any risk to the bottom line, because there really isn't much risk to the bottom line.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. Best of luck. Thank you.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Benedict: Hey, guys. Carol my congratulations as well. It's been great to work with you. The \u2013 for my first question and just looking back into the garden sales category I think it was called out as being above, I think last year it was 200-plus basis point headwind. Can you maybe give us a sense of just how impactful garden was at least here in the first quarter shifted or un-shifted however you'd like to do it? That's my first question.\nCraig Menear: Well, I would say in garden, we've planned for if there is such a thing a more normal spring. It turned out, it wasn't as normal as we'd liked. But what you saw and when we called out above the comp \u2013 company comp particularly in indoor garden that was all driven by a consumer response to just fantastic innovative product. And we've talked about product innovation, consumer finding the value in the store, the Pro finding the tool to help them save time and save money on their jobs. And we have just such terrific product in outdoor power equipment, particularly as cordless technology moves into that space with our new grills with pellet grills led by Traeger which is an exclusive to us by far the dominant player in pellet grills new patio collections. So, despite the not-so-great weather the customer responded to the product and the values and that's what really drove the business. Live goods for example has some room to make up, which we're looking forward to in Q2. And that's obviously weather-driven and when we get great weather our live goods are selling double digits and obviously when it's cold and rainy on a weekend not so much. But really pleased with the garden business, again you wouldn't \u2013 you won't think it would be as strong given the weather we talked about, but it's really product and value.\nPeter Benedict: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just \u2013 I think you called it earlier something around appliances that the customer service scores were up. I'm just curious, if you guys can give us an update of where you guys are in terms of delivery the DTC Delivery capabilities same-day, one-day. And just anything to call out there in terms of progress you're making on being more convenient for your customers? Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Peter, I'll make a comment and I'll turn it over to Mark. So 2018 was really the year that we put pilots in place and 2019 moving forward through 2022 will be the rollout of those. And so Mark, if you want to provide an update?\nMark Holifield: Sure. Thanks, Craig. And good morning, Peter. Yeah. We \u2013 first off in terms of next day and or one-day delivery coverage from our Home Depot Pro distribution centers formerly Interline, we already have coverage today via private fleet trucks for all our Home Depot Pro customers in all major metropolitan areas. When you look at parcel shipping capability from our direct fulfillment centers with secondary or faster delivery for over 90% of the population, we're at next day for 36% of the population. We began to retrofit our Hagerstown Maryland direct fulfillment center for further parcel shipping. And because of its proximity to the population centers of the Northeast that will get us to next-day delivery of parcel for 50% of the U.S. population by the end of this quarter. We'll further improve our next-day delivery capability with our new direct fulfillment centers under development in both Dallas and up in the Pacific Northwest near Seattle. And then when it comes to stores, we deliver from stores every day as well. And we've talked in the past about our delivery partnerships with Deliv and Roadie for crowd-sourced delivery via car and van. And that's now available to 40% of the U.S. population for car 70% for van. And what that means for customers is we've got same-day delivery available for orders placed by 2:00 P.M. and next day after that time. And by the end of Q2, we'll have the same day and next day capabilities for small parcel items from stores moving from 40% to 50% of the population. So our delivery keeps getting faster. And that's very important because our data showed that every time we take time out of the delivery lead time, we increase conversion. We've got new data tools that are helping us to know what products to stop where and what delivery options to enable. Those tools can help us with understanding, hey, if we take a day out of power tools versus a day out of power tool accessories which creates more value to our customers in terms of conversion and we can tell that across the departments and classes in the company.\nPeter Benedict: That's great color. Thanks Mark and good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Actually another delivery question and I appreciate all the color there. But when you look specifically at your Pro sales I'm sure it depends on category. What percent of your Pro sales today are delivered to a Pro's jobsite? And then, how do you think that evolves as you build out your supply chain in the delivery capabilities you were just talking about?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. Scott for competitive reasons obviously we won't share the specific data on that. But we believe that delivery is important for the Pro. In particular segments of the Pro customers, it's important to be able to get them what they need, when they need it, so that they can depend on that service. And that's what we're working to do.\nTed Decker: Yeah. And Craig a little bit more color on that. We're definitely designing our delivery offerings around key Pro use cases. For instance, we'll be opening our new flatbed delivery center out of Dallas later this year. That's really a Pro-oriented delivery with the flatbed trucks with the Moffett on the back they're able to put it on the jobsite. Also, we've implemented those two and four hour delivery windows that give our Pro reliability in terms of when a delivery will be there so that they can count on their crews being kept busy by having a great time with delivery.\nScot Ciccarelli: So let me ask this presumably as you build out that capability more and more people will wind up taking advantage of it presumably. That's why you're making it. But how should we think about that \u2013 the margin implications as the delivery to jobsite mix grows?\nCraig Menear: It's an all-in calculation that we use obviously. And as you grow with the Pro that actually uses delivery it gives us an opportunity to much more effectively compete against the distribution houses and the lumber and building material yards that provide the service and we look at as an all-in cost of operation considering what we get on the trucks and what kind of gross margin dollars that actually provides.\nMark Holifield: Yeah. And Craig, we manage this as a portfolio as you've said. And we have seen that when our Pros engage with us in delivery they buy more across the portfolio. So it's an important portfolio management tool for us.\nCraig Menear: And you get that blend with the Pro. The overall margin with the Pro on a blended basis is very comparable to the DIY customer.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. All right. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Sigman: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And, Carol again congrats to you. A couple of points I wanted to follow-up on. First on the deflation you talked about lumber being an 80 basis point headwind can you just give us a sense of the total commodity deflation impact comparable to sort of how you guys have disclosed it the past? And then the second part of the question is around just sort of broader inflation that you're seeing across the store. Outside of the commodity categories, sort of any trends that you're seeing? What are you guys seeing from vendors? And how are you trying to sort of manage through that from a retail price perspective?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Sure. If you look at the commodity business excluding lumber, we look at building materials and copper and there was actually a slight inflation in the quarter. About 30 basis points of growth came from commodity inflation. That was offset obviously by the stronger U.S. dollar because that was deflating, so it kind of works its way out. And then in terms of just general inflation across the store...\nTed Decker: Yes. I mean, I would say that has abated. So we track -- working with our finance partners very closely. All requests for cost changes from our supplier base, our own costs with our direct import product label supporting private label products that had ramped up meaningfully over 2018. And as we went into 2019, I wouldn't say it's reversed that we have a tighter way of a cost-out opportunity, but the pressure has subsided. So this is all putting aside the new tariff. I would say we're in a neutral to slightly positive cost position even excluding the lumber deflation. On the tariffs, so we increased the phase three tariffs on all products shipped out of China from May 10. So nothing has landed yet, think of three odd weeks to cross the Pacific Ocean. So we're looking at the end of this month, the increase on the tariffs of $200 billion of product going from 10% to 25%. For us, that's about -- call it $1 billion. So the tariffs we've already received through 2018, we've said it's manageable, it was roughly $1 billion impact. Should these new tariffs hold, it will be an incremental $1 billion. So call it less than 1% of our total sales. So it'll certainly be more acute in certain categories. But as we repeatedly say, we run the business as a portfolio. And 1% in aggregate of sales a little harder but to manage, but still I would call a manageable category.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: And so that's just the math of it.\nTed Decker: That's just the math of it.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: That's just the math of it. We haven't gone vendor-by-vendor, product-by-product to actually determine what the actions will be.\nCraig Menear: And Seth, I'd say there was one interesting thing to look at when we've talked about the tariff. So when you look at kind of what happened in laundry because that's one where it went into play, it was pushed throughout the market and candidly moved forward into retail. In the initial stage of that, we saw no impact for the first several months, then we actually saw negative unit declines come into play. And now we've seen double-digit positive growth in last quarter in laundry. So it's -- it will be interesting to see how those all plays through both in terms of how we can -- we'll work our portfolio approach as Ted said, but then how that actually plays out in the market, so more to come on that.\nTed Decker: Yes. To Craig's point, the laundry we'd say it's been completely digested. And it was our strongest comping appliance category as Craig said in double digits in that -- those tariffs have held and those go up to 50%.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Great. Thanks everybody for the color. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your questions.\nChuck Grom: Hey thanks, good morning and Carol congrats. Just on the macro front here, just wondering how sales are turning in some of the markets where we're starting to see some of the home prices start to slow down or in some cases compress?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Well let's take a market like L.A. There's been a lot of conversation about what's happening in home prices in L.A. Our comp in L.A. was considerably ahead our company for the first quarter. Let's take a market like New Jersey where people are very concerned about what would happen to sales, given it's a high-salt state and we see that New Jersey is actually outperforming the company average too. So trust me, we're spending a lot of attention looking at performance by market, but we just can't see anything at this point in a negative way. Pardon me we see lots of things but in a negative way.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Good. I just wanted to see if you guys could clarify on that. And then just on the guide, I know you're keeping the sales and the earnings. Just wondering if you're still comfortable with the 34% gross margin and the -- I believe the 53% expense growth factor and overall operating margin of 14.4%?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. Nothing has changed within the top and the bottom line of the P&L guide.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Great. Congrats again.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. First of all, Carol also Richard congrats. First question from me on the SG&A line, Q1 had the benefit of the calendar shift on the topline. Curious how that impacted margins here. And as we think about the cadence into Q2 with the calendar shift reversing, should we anticipate incremental deleverage with comps presumably above total sales? Could you just walk us through the moving parts here a little bit?\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes. So, first as it relates to the gross margin, the calendar shift doesn't impact the gross margin because you have 13 weeks of sales against 13 weeks of sales. From an expense perspective, because we do have a difference in our comp rate and our total sales growth rate, it will have a more meaningful impact on expenses either as a percent of sales or from an expense growth factor perspective. So we are expecting in the second quarter that our comp will be higher than our sales growth again because of the calendar shift. So you would expect our expense growth factor to be higher in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. Does that make sense? Hopefully that makes sense for you.\nZach Fadem: Yes. Yes. That makes sense. Appreciate that. And then second, just to follow up again on the -- tariff bigger -- inflation at the 10% level has abated a little bit. But perhaps you could comment on just the elasticity of demand in your categories based on the data that you have as further price increases look a little bit more inevitable here?\nCraig Menear: You broke up a little, but I think I got that. We look at the elasticity very carefully. And that supports when we always say we take a portfolio approach. We don't necessarily put dollar cost received into a like dollar increase in retail. If that's a super elastic item, we may hold it or not even drop price in that category for trying to spur demand and manage the cost increases somewhere else in the portfolio. And yes, we have very, very robust data and great again support with our finance partners and internal assortment planning and pricing teams that are working all those elasticities by category by product by market.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: These are sophisticated tools that we've built up over a number of years that allows us to have this kind of responsiveness.\nCraig Menear: Yes. It's going on eight years.\nCarol Tom\u00e9: Yes.\nZach Fadem: Got it, appreciate the color.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. Thank you. And maybe this was touched on already and I missed it. But just curious, if you could comment on current position from U.S. tile manufacturers for antidumping and countervailing duties against Chinese tile manufacturers. Do you source a meaningful percentage of your tile from China? And then what's the -- your current strategy as it pertains to duties, tariffs et cetera on those imported products?\nCraig Menear: We don't have a huge fight in the China tile import. Fortunately, we're sourcing largely domestically in Mexico.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. \nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Janci for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in August.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."}], "2021": [{"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2021-02-23 13:29:11", "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Home Depot's Quarterly Earnings Call.

Now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call this morning. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. Our thoughts are with those that have been impacted by the recent winter storms. Fiscal 2020 was a year that we certainly will not forget. It was a year of great hardship and adversity for so many, and our thoughts and prayers are with the millions of people who have been directly impacted by the pandemic. It is times like these that I have never been more thankful for the culture that our founders instilled in our business over 40 years ago. We have navigated this crisis by aligning our decisions and actions to some of our most important values to do the right thing and to take care of our people. At the end of the day, it is our people and culture that make us unique, our ability to manage unprecedented demand in the business while navigating the global pandemic and supporting our communities through multiple natural disasters and moments of crisis is a direct result of our associates' extraordinary efforts. As a result, investing in our associates during this time was one of the easier decisions we made this year. During fiscal 2020, in addition to record success sharing payouts, we invested a total of approximately $2 billion on enhanced compensation and benefits for our associates. As we announced last quarter, we transitioned from temporary COVID-19 benefits to permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline hourly associates. At the beginning of the year, I would have never thought it possible for the business to grow over $21 billion in 2020. For context, it took us 19 years as a company to achieve the first $20 billion in total sales, and we outgrew that in this year alone. This was enabled by investments we've made in the business as well as the team's exceptional execution and cross-functional alignment. COVID-19 and its impacts have forced us to change the way we live, work, and interact with one another, and there are some key learnings. The first is that the investments we have made in the business over the past decade were the right ones. And the second is that those investments enabled agility and flexibility to execute on critical business decisions in a changing and dynamic operating environment. Investments in technology and infrastructure helped us to extend our in-store BOPUS offering to curbside in a matter of days and convert a newly opened market delivery center facility to a direct fulfillment center in order to reduce online delivery lead times and improve the customer experience. The mechanization of our upstream supply chain helped us to better flow products to our stores, while investment in tools for our store associates and met teams help to get that product to the shelves for the customer more quickly and efficiently. Our merchants leverage data analytics to collaborate with our supplier partners to make real-time adjustments to our assortments as we work to prioritize the highest demand SKUs for our customers. Despite one of the most difficult operating environments we have ever faced, we continue to make progress with regards to our strategic initiatives. Key components of our One Home Depot strategy, such as opening of various supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancements to the digital experience remain on track. We have also restarted many of the in-store investments that were paused at the outset of the pandemic. As customers engage with The Home Depot, we see a continued blend of both the physical and digital worlds. As a result, we believe that the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant. Now turning to our financial highlights. Our results for the year clearly indicate that for many customers, the home has never been more important. Fiscal 2020 sales grew $21.9 billion to $132.1 billion, up 19.9% from last year. Comp sales were up 19.7% from last year, and our U.S. comps were positive 20.6%. Diluted earnings per share increased 16.5% to $11.94 for the year. We finished this year with another exceptional quarter as we saw the continuation of outsized demand for home improvement projects. Sales for the fourth quarter grew $6.5 billion to $32.3 billion, up 25.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 24.5% from last year, with U.S. comps of positive 25%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.65 for the fourth quarter. Our results this quarter, once again, were driven by broad-based strength across the business and geographies. All of our top 40 markets posted double-digit comps, while Canada posted comps above the Company average and Mexico posted double-digit comps in local currency. As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions were up double digits in the quarter, and we saw a strong double-digit growth from both the Pro and DIY customers. We had a record holiday season as our modified approach to Black Friday and gift center events clearly resonated with our customers. Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have continued to support record level web traffic on a consistent basis throughout the year. For the quarter, sales leverage in our digital platforms increased approximately 83% versus the prior year and approximately 55% of online orders were fulfilled through a store. For the year, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 86% versus last year and approximately 60% of online orders were fulfilled through a store. We continue to invest in our digital assets, introducing new capabilities in different ways to engage with The Home Depot, all with the goal of improving the customer experience. One of the customer enhancement tools that had to be completely reimagined in the COVID-19 environment was our in-store workshop program. For years, we have offered a number of different in-store workshops, including our kids' workshops. Until COVID-19, there wasn't an online option for these workshops, but in a few short months, we were able to successfully transition 100% of our workshop content online. The live streaming platform has allowed us to go from an average of five in-store workshops per month to approximately 40 online live streaming workshops per month. These online workshops have driven a deeper level of engagement and connectivity with our participating customers. One thing that did not change in fiscal 2020 is our disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. We remain committed to growing our dividend as earnings grow. As a result, today, we announced our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.65 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $6.60 per share. As we look to fiscal year 2021, Richard will provide some perspective into the factors that have the potential to impact the Company's performance. I'm incredibly proud of all we have accomplished in this unprecedented year, and I want to close by thanking our associates for the way they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during these challenging times. I also want to thank our supplier partners for their continued support and partnership throughout this year. In addition, I would like to welcome the associates from HD Supply back to The Home Depot family. As we close fiscal 2020, we have nearly completed our multiyear accelerated investment program that has positioned us well to serve our customers in this dynamic and changing environment. We have more conviction than ever that we have been investing in the right areas of the business, and we'll continue to invest to extend our competitive advantage and enable market share growth in any environment. We believe that our scale, combined with our low-cost position and continued focus on the customer, will help us win in a highly competitive marketplace and deliver exceptional returns for our shareholders. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to our associates and supplier partners for their unwavering dedication to our customers over the last year. During the fourth quarter, we continue to experience unprecedented levels of demand across our business. For the third quarter in a row, comps in the U.S. have been approximately 25%. With remarkable consistency, comps in the U.S. were at or above 20% for 36 of the past 39 weeks. And as you might expect, this level of demand pressured our supply chain, but our supply chain teams and supplier partners responded and continue making progress. Over the course of the third and fourth quarters, we made significant improvements to our in-stock positions, while supporting massive sales volumes. While there's always room for improvement and there are some current port delays, we believe we are well positioned as we head into our busy spring selling season. Moving on to comp performance in the fourth quarter, all of our merchandising departments posted double-digit comps, led by our lumber and indoor garden departments. Our comp average ticket increased 10.8% and comp transactions increased 12.6%. Similar to the last two quarters, the growth in our comp average ticket was supported by strong project demand, customers trading up to new and innovative products as well as continued inflation in certain commodity categories like lumber. During the quarter, we continued to experience significant volatility in lumber prices. As we exited the third quarter, lumber prices were falling sharply off the historic highs seen back in September. However, during the fourth quarter, pricing for both framing and panel lumber reversed and set new near-term highs, despite the elevated prices, unit comps in our lumber department accelerated further from the double-digit levels seen in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 220 basis points. Additionally, our comp transaction growth was supported by the same persistent strength in both online and in-store transactions that we have experienced in the prior two quarters. During the fourth quarter, big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000, were up approximately 23%. We saw strong performance across a number of big-ticket categories, including appliances, vinyl plank flooring and vanities. From a customer standpoint, during the quarter, we saw double-digit growth from both our Pro and DIY customers, with sales growth from our DIY customers once again outpacing that of our Pro customers. DIY sales growth was very consistent with the strong double-digit growth experienced in the second and third quarters. Sales to our Pro customer continued to accelerate, posting the best quarter of growth in 2020. As we've mentioned all year, our smaller Pro customers maintained consistent growth and posted strong double-digit growth in every month of the quarter. Growth from our larger Pro customers continued to accelerate, also growing double digits each month of the quarter. While the operating environment is still recovering for many of our larger Pro customers, we're encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing as backlogs are growing. Shifting to our DIY customers, we continue to benefit from heightened engagement from both new and existing customers. As our customers continue to spend more time at home, they're telling us their project lists are growing. After completing a project, we see many of our DIY customers take on additional and oftentimes more complex projects with a renewed sense of confidence. During the fourth quarter, our customers exhibited a lot of trends similar to what we saw throughout 2020. For instance, we saw continued strength in outdoor living categories like patio furniture, grills and outdoor power equipment, as customers tried to extend the outdoor living season. We also saw strong performance from popular interior project categories like Vanity's faucets, moldings and interior lighting. Customer engagement in our annual Black Friday and gift center events was strong. As I previewed on last quarter's call, we took a different approach to our events this year to prioritize the health and safety of our associates and customers. We made deeper buys on fewer SKUs. We changed the way we use our lay-down areas and end caps, and we extended our events over several weeks to avoid driving too much traffic on any one single day, and we could not be more thrilled with the results. Over the holiday season, our customers said they wanted a sense of normality. They told us they wanted to decorate for the holidays and make the most of the season, while spending more time at home with family. So they bought big and they bought early, and we saw a record level of sell-through with our decorative holiday assortment. During the quarter, our interconnected and digital assets continued to perform well. Over the last several years, we've rebuilt our website and invested across our platforms to upgrade our infrastructure and improve the shopping experience. These investments allowed us to handle the enormous growth in web traffic and convert more of that traffic into sales. During fiscal 2020, homedepot.com had more than 3.6 billion visits and our conversion rate increased double digits across all platforms, including our app, mobile and desktop. Turning our attention to the upcoming spring season, I could not be more excited about our comprehensive lineup book products, including our number one position in outdoor power equipment. As we've discussed, the cordless outdoor power market continues to outpace growth of the gas market. Cordless tools are easier to use, more environmentally friendly and have the power and run time to get most jobs done. Like we have done with our tool department, we are resetting our outdoor power equipment base by branded battery platform. Customers can now shop our leading and exclusive lineup by platform including Makita, Milwaukee, Ryobi, Toro and DeWalt. We are thrilled with the results and expect these resets will be complete in the first quarter. This spring, we're excited to introduce a new lineup of outdoor power from Ryobi, the number one cordless outdoor power brand, the new Ryobi HP High-Performance Brushless product was introduced in our tool department last year. We are now expanding it into cordless mowers, trimmers and blowers. The cordless mowers come with 70 minutes of run time and we are excited about the additional innovation coming in the product pipeline. As we look forward to spring, we know that now, more than ever, the home has never been more important. We feel great about our position as the number one retailer for home improvement, and we look forward to serving our customers in the busy spring selling season. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the face of what was a difficult year for many, including for many of our associates, I am proud of the actions we took to take care of our people, our customers and our communities. In the fourth quarter, total sales were $32.3 billion, an increase of $6.5 billion or 25.1% from last year. Our total company comps were positive 24.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 24.4% in November, 22.4% in December and 26.5% in January. Comps in the U.S. were positive 25% for the quarter with positive comps of 24.3% in November, 21.8% in December and 28.4% in January. All 19 of our U.S. regions as well as Canada and Mexico posted double-digit positive comps in local currency. For the year, our sales totaled a record $132.1 billion, with sales growth of $21.9 billion versus fiscal 2019. For the year, total company comp sales increased 19.7%, and U.S. comp sales increased 20.6%. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.6%, a decrease of approximately 30 basis points from last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted during the quarter by several factors, including product mix, shrink and pressure from rising transportation costs. Mix pressure from lumber alone negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. For the year, our gross margin was 34%. During the fourth quarter, operating expenses were approximately 20.9% of sales, representing an increase of approximately 25 basis points compared to last year. Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. First, we incurred approximately $110 million of non-recurring expense related to the completion of the HD Supply acquisition creating approximately 30 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Second, during the quarter, we continued to support our associates with enhanced benefits in response to COVID-19 and transitioned our temporary support programs to permanent compensation enhancements, which we announced last quarter. These expenses totaled approximately $340 million during the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately 105 basis points of expense deleverage. Third, we incurred approximately $55 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in approximately 20 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Fourth, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $325 million, an increase of approximately $45 million compared to last year. And finally, during the fourth quarter, we showed strong expense control in other areas of the business and drove approximately 130 basis points of expense leverage. Included in this 130 basis points of leverage is approximately 80 basis points of pressure driven by accrued bonus expense primarily related to our outperformance for our biannual store success sharing program and store- and field-based management bonuses for the second half. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 12.7% and for the year was approximately 13.8%. Excluding the one-time expense associated with the completion of the HD Supply acquisition, our operating margin would have been 13% for the fourth quarter and 13.9% for the year. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter grew by $35 million to $327 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels compared to one year ago. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9%, and for fiscal 2020 was 24.2%. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.65, an increase of approximately 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The one-time expenses related to the completion of the HD Supply acquisition of approximately $110 million negatively impacted our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.09. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 were $11.94, an increase of 16.5% compared to fiscal 2019. During the year, we opened two new stores and ended the year with a store count of 2,296. Retail selling square footage was approximately 239 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per retail square foot were $544, the highest in our company's history. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $16.6 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion versus last year, and inventory turns were 5.8x, and up from 4.9x from the same period last year. Moving on to capital allocation, our long-term principles for how we think about deploying capital have not changed. We will continue to invest in the business. After investing in the business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and through share repurchases. During fiscal 2020, we invested approximately $2.5 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. We also invested approximately $8 billion in the acquisition of HD Supply to enhance our capabilities and drive accelerated sales growth in a highly fragmented MRO space. We completed this acquisition on December 24. During the year, we paid approximately $6.5 billion of dividends to our shareholders. We look to grow our dividend every year as we grow earnings. And as you heard from Craig, today, we announced our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 10%. In mid-March, we suspended our share repurchases as part of several steps we took to further enhance our strong liquidity position. Prior to that suspension, we repurchased approximately $600 million or 2.5 million shares of outstanding stock in fiscal 2020. We expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and we will also maintain an enhanced cash position of at least $4 billion during fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, we raised approximately $8 billion of staggered maturity, long-term debt to enhance our liquidity position, partially fund the acquisition of HD Supply and repay approximately $2.75 billion of senior notes. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 40.8%, down from 45% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects our decision to temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the suspension of our share repurchases back in March. Now I'll turn to our outlook for 2021. The strong and consistent demand environment we've seen over the past nine months has continued into February. Our customers tell us that their home has never been more important and that they will continue to take on home improvement projects. The housing environment remains strong as increased demand for single-family homes has driven housing turnover and home price appreciation. However, significant uncertainty remains with respect to the course of the pandemic, the distribution of vaccines, short-term fiscal policy and how these developments will impact the broader economy and ultimately, consumer spending. Given these uncertainties, we are limited in our ability to forecast demand for the year, particularly as it relates to the back half. For this reason, we are not providing guidance for fiscal 2021. While we are not able to predict how consumer spending will evolve, if the demand environment during the back half of fiscal 2020 were to persist through fiscal 2021, it would imply flat to slightly positive comparable sales growth. We calculate this by assuming the sales dollar level of demand that we saw in the fourth quarter continues throughout 2021, adjusting for historical seasonality. In this demand environment, we calculate our fiscal 2021 operating margin would be at least 14%. Let me give a little more color around the drivers of our operating margin and investments for fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, we experienced pressure to gross margin, notably from product mix and shrink. For fiscal 2021, we expect continued pressure to our gross margin from higher transportation costs and shrink. In addition, we will experience some pressure in gross margin as we continue to build out our One Supply Chain network. Remember that the majority of the costs associated with opening and operating our supply chain facilities are accounted for in our cost of goods sold. As we transition from 2020 into 2021, our operating expenses will reflect the move away from temporary COVID-related pay and benefits to permanent wage investments, the continuation of strategic investments in the business and the impact of lapping areas of under spend, such as understaffed stores that we realized last year. In fiscal 2020, we incurred approximately $2 billion of expense related to enhanced pay and benefits for our associates. Last quarter, we transitioned away from our temporary support programs in response to COVID and increased permanent compensation for our frontline hourly associates by approximately $1 billion on an annualized basis. In addition, we also incurred approximately $240 million of expense related to COVID operational costs during fiscal 2020, primarily in the form of personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and for enhanced cleaning of our stores. As long as the COVID environment persists, we would expect to incur approximately $250 million of COVID-related operating expenses on an annualized basis for fiscal 2021, primarily related to PPE, additional cleaning as well as extended leave for associates who were directly impacted by COVID-19. During fiscal 2020, we chose to defer some of our in-store strategic investments, both capital and expense, to prioritize the safety of our associates and customers. We expect to complete these investments in fiscal 2021. As we look back on our investments from 2018 to 2020, we believe that we focused on the right areas, improve the customer experience and grew significantly faster than our market. As we move forward, we are committed to investing in our business to stay ahead of customer expectations and further enhance the customer experience with two main objectives in mind: first, to deliver returns by driving growth faster than the market in any environment; and second, to further strengthen our position as the low-cost provider in home improvement, with a relentless focus on productivity and efficiency. This approach will result in a steadier level of investment in both capital and expense going forward. For fiscal 2021, we estimate capital expenditures of approximately 2% of sales. It is our intent to make those investments on a steadier cadence and to drive operating expense leverage while preserving the ability to adjust our investments as needed. We estimate that our fiscal 2021 effective tax rate will be similar to what we reported in fiscal 2020. As we begin 2021, we believe that we've positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment. The investments we've made in our business have enabled flexibility in our operating model as well as our financial model. As we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen this position and extend our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market, regardless of what the environment may look like. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning everyone. My first question is on the expense line. Richard, if I heard right, I think you said there was about $2 billion of costs that were present in 2020. I think about $1 billion of them become permanent. And then I think you said $250 million of -- I don't know, temporary costs related to equipment, et cetera. I think -- and then you said, we also need to think about expenses that weren't spent in 2020 related to, I think, one, HD that will come back into 2021. Is there any way you can quantify that? And then does that mean that at some point, there's, I don't know, $500 million or $750 million of cost that, in theory, sort of roll off the P&L?\nRichard McPhail: Well, Simeon, thank you for your question. There are a lot of ins and outs. And so that was actually the intent behind the sort of margin case that we put forward. And so, again, just to sort of recap how you get to a 14% margin in that case that we provided. Let's start with the operating expense side. You have a few primary drivers, and I'll tick through those. First, you have the permanent investment in wage for our hourly associates as we transition from temporary support programs in the fourth quarter. You have the continuation of COVID-related operational expenses to keep our stores and our associates safe. You have the overlap of some expense benefit from understaffing in the first-half last year as sales ramped up. So the period, as we were growing staff to meet the sharp acceleration in sales, so that is the year-over-year overlap that you asked about. And then if you look on the cost of goods side, just to cover and come all the way down to 14, we're expecting to see continued pressure from transportation costs, continued pressure from shrink. You'll see pressure reflecting the opening up of our One Supply Chain buildings as we ramp up capacity utilization in that network and a return to a more normal stance with respect to events. And finally, the last comment, getting us to the 14 in that case, is that you'll see slightly higher non-cash amortization related to the HD Supply acquisition. That's about 10 basis points of an impact to operating margin, but that's non-cash. So that's the bridge to 14.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up, maybe for Craig and for you, Richard. If we go back to 2017, realizing that a lot of things have changed, the One HD investments, I think, were slated somewhere of a 20 basis point hit to margin and a benefit is up too much as 40 basis points. If that's still the case, and then we do have COVID costs rolling off, it feels like margins are being held back a bit, meaning they could be a good amount higher. Are you -- I don't know if your commitment or your philosophy has changed in some of what you're speaking about regarding continuing a certain level of investment to maintain that growth ahead of the market? Or will you allow margin to go up, not gross per se, but more SG&A leverage if you retain a lot of the sales from this period going forward.\nCraig Menear: Simeon, our overall philosophy hasn't changed from the timeframe that we started the accelerated investment. We said that we needed to do that because we had to get ahead of where the customer was taking us. And that's why we made the investment that we did in terms of the $11.1 billion. And the intent behind that was twofold. Number one, we wanted to be able to grow faster than the market, gaining share in the marketplace and then accelerate our incremental op margin dollar growth. Since we started the program in fiscal 2017 through 2018 to 2020 and market share is a little elusive in our market. But based on the best data we can get, we believe that we've captured about 275 basis points of share growth during that timeframe. And so that has -- during the whole investment, we're taking share. And so going forward, our approach is to make sure that we are investing on a more steady cadence what we need to in the business to make sure that we can stay ahead of the customer and we can continue to gain those kind of accelerated share growth opportunities going forward. And our focus is around really optimizing op margin dollars. And if we can do that and drive incremental op margin dollars, we'll let rate fall where it falls.\nRichard McPhail: And just to add to Craig's comment about market share capture, if you take that 275 basis points and translate that into dollars that share gain represents $10 billion of incremental sales annually to our top line versus where we were in 2017. So you -- as you heard from Craig, scale matters, our position as low-cost provider matters, and our investments put us in position to extend both.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks, guys. Take care. Good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. I hope everyone is well. Can you provide some incremental details regarding HD Supply, specifically, how do you guys plan to integrate it with Interline or your existing MRO business? And then how are you guys thinking about kind of the market opportunity from here?\nCraig Menear: First of all, we're thrilled with the acquisition of HD Supply. They are clearly a leader in the MRO space. And it really strengthens our position in a $55 billion fragmented market opportunity. And so, we're super excited about that. We're going to take our time and look at how we encompass all the assets that exists between the formerly Interline and now HD Supply and we'll put a plan together that will allow us to use all that asset base to be able to grow and capture share in the MRO market. We're super excited about that opportunity.\nScot Ciccarelli: But given the fragmentation of that market, now that you have, let's call it, two of the bigger operations kind of joining hands, if you will, you should have about -- we're estimating about 10% market share in MRO. Does your growth potential actually accelerate just because you can basically answer the bell to so many more customers?\nCraig Menear: I mean, that's clearly why we made the acquisition. We want to accelerate growth in that space. And it's a great space and allows us to penetrate into a housing segment that was more difficult to penetrate with the orange box. So, we're super excited about the opportunity.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it.\nTed Decker: Yes. Scot, the capability set of those two combined companies, far and away, the strongest distribution network. I mean, this is a distribution business in looking at integrating the two supply chains to, by far, the leading national distribution network. And then increasingly digital, transacting digitally and being able to put the capabilities that we have built with our digital assets for the consumer business, our B2B assets, and HD Supply starts with a very healthy and well-performing site as well. And then add the sales force in thousands of folks on the street with, by far, the largest distribution sales force in this space. So you put all that together, you have a much stronger calling card when you go to see new and prospective customers.\nScot Ciccarelli: Excellent. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Grom, your line is live. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Baker: A couple of follow-ups. First, on the gross margin, you talked about a lot of pressures. I didn't hear anything necessarily that that would improve year-over-year. So can we infer from that, that you expect gross margins to be down next year? And then, I wanted to ask you about inventory, I think it was up about 14%, which clearly shows a better in-stock position than it had been, but how does that compare to where you had planned it to be at the end of the quarter? Thanks.\nTed Decker: So on the inventory position, Michael, as I made comments in my prepared remarks, we feel great about going into the spring. Our in-stock positions have been gaining ground while we've supported that $21 billion of comp growth. You just think of the physics of moving that much cube through our network, we were able to do that while continuing to improve our in-stock levels. We -- our store inventories are, as you see in our release, about $2 billion over, and we have plans to increase that further. As we went into the pandemic, last year, we took some very aggressive actions, as we've said, with a focus on safety for our customers and our associates. We backed off a lot of promotions. And when we backed off those promotions, we also backed off inventory. We are now preparing for a more normalized spring, and we're putting that inventory back into our forecast. So, we'll have an even stronger inventory position where we sit today as we go into the height is spring. So, we just feel great. The supply chain teams, our supplier partners, our merchants have worked hand-in-hand to get that type flow into our building to the spring season, and we'll be in a much better position than we were last year to capture that demand.\nRichard McPhail: And on gross margin, Michael, today, we're not providing guidance. And I can tell you, we're focused on driving gross profit dollars and driving operating expense leverage.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. I had a follow-up on the investment side. You talked about 2% of sales for CapEx. That's about $2.7 billion, rough math here in '21. Do you stay at that 2% level of sales as you go beyond '21? And then on the OpEx side related to investments, will investment dollars be -- in OpEx be down in '21 and down further in '22? Maybe the best way to frame it is, how are you thinking about that core ex-COVID, SG&A versus sales growth metric as you look in '21 and '22?\nCraig Menear: Chris, we're using the CapEx expense of approximately 2% of sales is kind of a rule of thumb. We clearly have flexibility in that, but the most important thing is we know that in today's world, retailers have to continue to invest to be able to stay with customer needs and expectations and those that haven't done that over the years, unfortunately, the road is littered with retailers that didn't do that. And so we'll never put Home Depot in that position. And we believe that, that 2% is a good rule of thumb for us to think about. And then, embedded in our operating margin going forward is the associated expense with capital spend, and that varies depending on what type of expense you have, but our focus is now that we're past our large part, past our accelerated investment period, we're going to get back to operating leverage.\nRichard McPhail: From this point going forward.\nCraig Menear: Yes.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up -- quick follow-up on the gross margin. How are you thinking about the potential impact of lumber? Are you baking in a headwind there, given where our pricing is right now? And then is Home Depot supply a potential good guy offset as we think about the puts and takes on gross margin?\nTed Decker: So Chris, on supply, the margin actually isn't a good guy. I mean, it's...\nRichard McPhail: It's on a like-for-like basis. There's -- this is immaterial to the Company.\nTed Decker: It's immaterial.\nRichard McPhail: Yes, yes.\nTed Decker: What they've been reporting, they don't include the supply chain expenses. So we'll make that like Home Depot with supply chain and four-wall distribution in the gross margin, not as an operating expense. And then the other one on lumber, on lumber, we don't plan lumber commodity price moving up or down. It's obviously been a huge impact in 2020. It's about $1.7 billion of sales was attributed to lumber price inflation over the course of 2020, but we don't even shoot at what that might do. We just assume that the levels will stay as they are as we exit the year. And as you know, we have a very flexible supply chain, particularly in lumber. We have our bulk lumber DCs where we're taking product in from our supplier partners in shipping those real-time daily lumber deliveries to the stores. So we never have huge quantities of inventory to get trapped with a good guy or a bad guy. So it's pretty fluid in mark-to-market. And again, don't make any sort of predictions of whether that's going to go up or down in help or hurt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Richard, I wanted to focus on the outlook for strategic spending. So maybe both my questions will really be focused to your -- you mentioned the $325 million of quarterly spend. And I think that's been consistent for the past two quarters. So any color on how we should be modeling the quarterly investment spend, especially given your prior commentary, right, that I think we should expect the absolute level to be neutral on a year-over-year basis?\nRichard McPhail: I'll go back to Craig's comment on this. Now that the investment program is substantially complete, you're going to see us return to a steadier, more consistent investment posture. And so just think about -- if you're talking about modeling, what that means, we had a three-year period where in many periods, expenses grew faster than sales because of the expense component of the plan. And CapEx, obviously, was elevated. What we're telling you today is going forward, we are moving to that steady and consistent cadence. And so as Craig said, capital expenditures will approximate 2% of sales. And then expenses associated with it are assumed within the margin case that we laid out. And from this point going forward, we intend to deliver operating expense leverage on a consistent basis.\nSteven Forbes: And maybe just a follow-up on that comment, again, if you can, right, if we think about what transpired over the past couple of years at the quarterly level of investment spend, I think, ramped from 75, which was considered business as usual to this 325. So are your commentaries implying that we should expect, maybe not this year, but over a multiyear period to return to those prior levels of investment spend or normal case investment spend? Or should we anticipate a return to a above right that 75 level given just the incremental needs of the business. Any more detailed commentary would be helpful.\nRichard McPhail: So, I think it's important to remember the context that when we kicked this investment program off, we were $100 billion in sales, and now we're over $130 billion in sales. And so getting -- talking about dollars versus percentages, I think, becomes less relevant and meaningful. So what we're trying to do is provide you with sort of our stance going forward, which again, is going to be steady and consistent. And so if you take the case that we laid out, which is simply the case, where we would expect at least 14% operating margin in a flat to slightly positive comp environment, that would include our view of all operating expenses. And going forward, we expect and intend to deliver operating expense leverage on a consistent basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Craig, could you talk a bit more about the 220 basis points of share gains you called out as 2020 was clearly a big year, and you called out the impact of your strategic initiatives. But given that your investments are ongoing and the benefits are still early days, could you talk about why you think share gains can further accelerate in 2021? And where you think the most opportunity is across your various DIY Pro and MRO customer bucket?\nCraig Menear: Sure. So from '18 through '20, it was roughly 275 basis points of share gain that we saw. And again, the intent of the investments, both the previous three years where we needed to kind of jump-start and get ahead of the customer and what we're building out and the capabilities going forward, we believe will position us well to continue to gain share really in all of the segments that you just called out, DIY, Pro and in the MRO space. That's our focus. That's what we're trying to get done. We are investing in what we believe the interconnected element of how the customer is engaging in retail today is hugely important, particularly in our space, the project business, where the customer is blending both the physical and digital worlds to be able to complete their project. We're seeing that ongoing. We are excited about the engagement that we've had with new customers into the business with the expansion of the millennial generation in home improvement and home ownership. And we believe that these investments ongoing will allow us to be in a position to continue to capture outsize share. That's why we made them. That's what we're focused on and what we see going forward.\nZach Fadem: Got it. That makes sense. And then for Richard and Ted, can you talk about your base case for inflation this year, both in terms of pass-through commodity prices and that impact on ticket, but also what you anticipate from vendor cost increases and how you think about passing on these increases versus offsetting via portfolio pricing and other productivity initiatives?\nRichard McPhail: On general inflation, again, today, we're not providing guidance. Economists views vary and so the case that we laid out to you today is simply a mathematical extrapolation. Ted, maybe you'll talk about on the vendor side?\nTed Decker: Yes. I'd say that there's no doubt commodity prices are on a tear right now. We were just talking about lumber prices, and we hit all-time record highs, over $1,000, 1,000 board feet last week, which is up a staggering 140-odd percent from the prior year. A stick of lumber that was $2 odd dollars is now over $5. Similarly, copper hit 4 11. Yesterday, I believe that's a 12-year high. Those type products, copper and wire, lumber, obviously and all stick goods, those are priced to market by virtually everyone in the marketplace. So, we don't have a lot of anxiety around managing the commodity flows. As it comes to transportation and which are real transportation costs and suppliers who are obviously seeing some cost pressures, we've managed that for 41 years. There's been periods of hyperinflation. There have been periods of muted inflation. We run this as a portfolio. We work closely with our supplier partners to be the advocate for value for the customer. And as I think about all that's going on now, I reflect back to the tariffs and I guess I want for that was our biggest issue when we were managing tariffs. But tariffs and now the commodity environment is just one more in a string of market dynamics that our merchant teams have worked through for 41 years.\nCraig Menear: I don't know if it's helpful, but just on -- in the context of kind of the market to market moves, that represents roughly 18% to 20% of our volume that moves as commodities move on an ongoing basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: So can you calibrate the scenario that you laid out for the year ahead? If your comp is flat to slightly up, you would have at least a 14% operating margin. What happens if your comp is down 5%, can you still have a 14% operating margin?\nRichard McPhail: We're not going to speculate, Michael. We do retain a good degree of financial flexibility, but our actions will truly depend on the circumstances that are present at the moment.\nCraig Menear: And just -- I mean, remember, our largest cost in the business is our cost associated with payroll, and that is driven on a transactional basis. It flexes with volume.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. A more longer-term question. Prior to 2018, Home Depot typically had a 20% to 30% incremental margin on additional sales. In the last few years, owing to the tariffs, owing to the strategic investment plan and owing to COVID, the contribution margin has been in single digit, maybe low teens range. Looking past 2021, do you think you can get back to an incremental margin that's in line with your historical experience? Or for whatever reason, is the ability to gain share in home improvement just more expensive today than it's been in the past? And why would that be the case?\nRichard McPhail: I would disagree with your last statement, but I can tell you that our focus is driving incremental operating profit dollar growth and earnings growth, and we do that. Everything we do eventually directs itself towards driving sales productivity or cost productivity. And so that's what we're focused on. At the end of the day, it's about operating profit growth. And that's what we're focused on.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: A big picture kind of question and then just a follow-up on some of the components of guidance, but I guess is there any way to quantify the Pro backlog? And then is there any way you could frame how you think about the DIY versus the Pro comp in 2021? And then on your guidance with respect to shrink lingering in 2021, I guess, I was under the impression that, that would be something that you would cycle as we got to the end of this year. So any color on that would be great.\nCraig Menear: Yes, Karen, it's really difficult to try to quantify a Pro backlog. The only thing we can share with you is what our Pros tell us and that their jobs are building. We've seen an acceleration of the Pro business from quarter-to-quarter. And as it was called out in the fourth quarter, we actually had our best quarter of the rolling 12 with the Pro. I think the thing that is really interesting is the fact that on the DIY side, we've seen the acceleration of the millennial generation engagement with home improvement and home ownership. And over time, the thing that will be interesting to watch is, has that, in fact, expanded the market? That's an interesting question that we don't know the answer to, but we're watching carefully. So we think there's a lot of opportunity as we go forward.\nRichard McPhail: Yes. And on shrink, we saw pressure on a year-over-year basis in 2020, and that pressure was pretty consistent across the quarters. At this elevated level of sales, though, it's harder to tell the degree of the impact we've made. So, we're going to keep watching it and working the problem.\nOperator: Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in May.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you Isabel, and thanks for joining our call this morning. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. As we announced yesterday, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire HD Supply, a leading national distributor of maintenance, repair and operations products in the multi-family and hospitality end markets. Before moving to the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to discuss how HD supply fits into our strategic framework.  As you know, the MRO customer is an important pro customer for The Home Depot. We are committed to better serving the MRO customer and growing in this space. The success we\u2019ve had with our existing MRO business makes us confident in our ability to accelerate sales growth in a highly fragmented $55 billion MRO marketplace. While the transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals, I look forward to welcoming the HD Supply associates to The Home Depot. Richard will take you through the financial details shortly. Now let\u2019s discuss our third quarter results. Sales for the third quarter grew $6.3 billion to $33.5 billion, up 23.2% from last year. Comp sales were up 24.1% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 24.6%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.18 in the third quarter.  The third quarter was another exceptional quarter for The Home Depot as we saw the continuation of outsized demand for home improvement projects. Our results were driven by broad-based strength across the store and geographies. All of our top 40 markets posted double digit comps while Canada posted comps above the company average and Mexico posted its best performance since the onset of the pandemic, with double-digit comps in local currency. As Ted will detail, both tickets and transactions were up double digits in the quarter and we saw strong double digit growth from both the pro and DIY customers. As we mentioned last quarter, the step change in volume of business that we have witnessed over the last six months is not without its challenges, but our strategic investments coupled with our near term actions taken have allowed us to better serve our customers. Our third quarter performance is a reflection of this and as we continue to learn and adapt to meet the unprecedented level of demand we were seeing in the market. Actions we have taken across our supply chain, in our stores, and in partnership with our suppliers have helped us to improve in-stock levels, reduce lead times, better manage in-store replenishment, and improve fulfillment options and delivery times. All of this has ultimately translated to over 300 basis points of sequential improvement in customer satisfaction scores for the third quarter. Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have continued to support record level web traffic on a consistent basis for over six months. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 80% versus the third quarter last year and approximately 60% of online orders were fulfilled through a store. We continue to invest in our digital assets, introducing new capabilities and different way to engage with The Home Depot. Over the past several months, we have refreshed the digital experience in key categories and are extremely pleased with the customer response. In decorative lighting, for example, we enhanced the category experience to offer improved visual imaging and more lifestyle photos of our on-trend lighting assortment. As a result of these changes and increased marketing effort to better highlight our offering, we have seen significantly higher customer engagement with the category online which helped to drive sales growth above the company average in the quarter.  We also found new ways to leverage our online platform to better showcase our assortment for events. For our Halloween event, we increased our digital offering and enhanced our presentation, which resonated with our customers, resulting in the strongest customer response we\u2019ve had to these events. We are focused on continuing the momentum of our strategic investments to enhance the interconnected shopping experience and position ourselves for continued share capture over the long term. Key components of our One Home Depot strategy, such as opening various supply chain facilities, technology investments, and enhancements to the digital experience remain on track, and we have now restarted many of the store investments that were paused at the onset of the pandemic. Our results through the first nine months of the year clearly indicate that for many customers, the home has never been more important, and we hear from them that they will continue to invest in home improvement through a multitude of different projects and plan to embrace the upcoming holiday season. As customers engage with The Home Depot, we see a continued blend of both the physical and digital worlds. As a result, the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant. I\u2019m incredibly proud of our associates for the many ways that they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during these unquestionably challenging times. Our ability to grow the business by more than $15 billion through the first nine months of the year while navigating the global pandemic and supporting our communities through multiple natural disasters is a direct result of our associates\u2019 extraordinary efforts. Given the ongoing demands and complexity of the current environment, we continue to focus on taking care of our people in part by extending weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers for the duration of the third quarter. Through the end of the third quarter, we have spent approximately $1.7 billion on temporary pay and benefits in response to COVID-19.  As Richard will discuss, we have now made the decision to transition from our temporary weekly bonus program to invest in permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline hourly associates. This will result in approximately $1 billion of incremental compensation expense on an annualized basis. Our orange apron associates are the heartbeat of The Home Depot, and supporting them through this time of uncertainty and beyond continues to be a key priority. We know that we must remain agile and flexible to execute against the demands of the current environment and our third quarter performance highlights key progress that we have made as we continue to learn and adapt. I could not be more proud of the resilience and strength that our associates have continued to demonstrate and I want to thank them and our supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities. Finally, I want to take a quick moment to congratulate Ted, Ann-Marie and Jeff, who are on the call with me today, on their recent promotions and expanded responsibilities. Their new roles are among a number of leadership development moves that we have made as we continue to invest and grow the deep bench of talent that we are fortunate to have here at The Home Depot. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks Craig, and good morning everyone. I want to thank all of our associates and supplier partners for their incredible effort to serve our customers in this unprecedented environment. The consistently strong demand we\u2019ve seen over the last six month has been remarkable. For the last two quarters, we have seen comps north of 20% for 25 of the 26 weeks. The strong demand has pressured supply chains, and we have partnered with our supplier partners to make various improvements. As we mentioned last quarter, the actions we took include adjusting our assortments and plan-o-grams, introducing alternative products and, in some cases, reducing the numbers of SKUs in certain categories to focus on the highest demand products. In addition, we are further mechanizing our rapid deployment center network. We\u2019ve now implemented mechanized floor loading in two-thirds of our facilities, meaningfully improving our productivity in those buildings. As a result of all these actions, we have seen reduced product lead times and continued improvement in our in-stock positions. The in-stock level in our U.S. stores has improved for 12 straight weeks. While we are pleased with these results, we are not at pre-pandemic levels.  We have also revisited customer fulfillment choices, some of which we\u2019d paused earlier in the year. As a result, we are starting to reestablish premium delivery windows and express car and van delivery service that covers over 70% of the U.S. population.  During the third quarter, each of our merchandising departments posted double-digit comps, led by our lumber and d\u00e9cor and storage departments. Our comp average ticket increased 10% and comp transactions increased 13%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by the continuation of project demand we saw in the second quarter, customers trading up to new and innovative items, as well as inflation in certain commodity categories like lumber.  Over the last four months, we\u2019ve seen significant volatility in the pricing of lumber as the industry works to balance supply and demand. During the third quarter, the average price of framing lumber was approximately 130% higher than the same period last year. As we exited the quarter, pricing for certain lumber categories had fallen from the peaks we saw mid-quarter but still sit well above the levels we saw this time last year. Despite this significant inflation, we saw strong double-digit unit comps in lumber in the third quarter. During the third quarter, inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 260 basis points. Additionally, the strength of our comp transaction growth was driven by consistently strong in-store and online transactions, continuing the same trends we saw in the second quarter. During the third quarter, big ticket comp transactions, or those over $1,000, were up approximately 23%. We saw strong performance across a number of big ticket categories like appliances, vinyl plank flooring, and lumber.  During the third quarter, we saw double-digit growth in both our pro and DIY customers, and while DIY sales grew faster than pro sales, our pro business posted the strongest growth we\u2019ve seen all year. As we look at our different pro cohorts, growth with our smaller pro customers has been consistent with strong double-digit growth every month of the year. Growth with our larger pro customers is healthy and accelerated from the second quarter; however, some large pros still face headwinds related to the current operating environment, including some customers being hesitant to invite pros into their homes. Turning to our DIY customers, we continue to see unprecedented levels of engagement from both new and existing customers across a variety of home improvement projects, and importantly as these customers complete a project, they are gaining the confidence to tackle their next project and re-engage with The Home Depot. During the third quarter, we saw customers take advantage of an extended selling season for our garden seasonal categories, resulting in significant growth in categories like hardscapes, soils, riding mowers and outdoor power equipment; however, garden and seasonal were not the only projects our customers were working on. If we exclude our garden departments from our third quarter results, our comp was still north of 20%.  We saw customers working on a variety of projects across their home in categories like garage and organization, ceiling fans, vanities, and power tools all posting comps well above the company average. The customer engagement we are seeing was also evident in our annual Halloween event. During the third quarter, we hosted our most successful Halloween event with both in-store and online offerings. Customers responded to our larger assortment of animatronics, inflatables and yard d\u00e9cor, as evidenced by our 12-foot giant skeleton that sold out before October, helping drive a record level of sell-through for the event. As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the upcoming holiday season and believe that we are in a great position for continued customer engagement. During the quarter, we will be hosting our annual holiday, Black Friday and gift center events; however, this year they are going to look a little different as we remain committed to prioritizing the health and safety of our customers and associates and promoting a safe shopping environment. We\u2019ve adjusted our Black Friday event this year to cover an extended period of time and not just focus on one day. Additionally, for both our Black Friday and our gift center events, we\u2019ve reorganized how we place and stage our product to assist with social distancing. For example, we\u2019ve reduced the amount of product displayed on our front racetrack and we\u2019ve created more space for our gift center presentation. We\u2019ve made deeper buys on fewer SKUs to bring great values to our customers, and we\u2019ve also included some of our core SKUs in our event which will help with replenishment as we continue to see strong comps. For example, featured in our gift center and Black Friday events this year, our exclusive power tool products from our industry-leading assortment of Milwaukee, Makita, DeWalt, Rigid, Ryobi and more.  This year, we are especially excited about the launch of Ryobi 18-volt ONE+ HP brushless tools. These tools have been designed from the ground up to serve our DIY and pro customers with more features and performance than ever. HP tools are up to 20% lighter and 30% more compact while delivering improved power and durability with brushless motors. The Ryobi ONE+ platform has more than 100 million batteries in our customers\u2019 home and job sites today, and this new HP line-up brings a strong pipeline of future innovation to the more than 175 Ryobi ONE+ tools in the marketplace today. Our Black Friday and gift center events kicked off a little over a week ago, and we are thrilled with the early results. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you Ted, and good morning everyone. We appreciate everyone joining the call today and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. In the third quarter, total sales were $33.5 billion, a 23.2% increase from last year. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $100 million. Our total company comps were positive 24.1% for the quarter with positive comps of 21.8% in August, 27.8% in September, and 23% in October. Comps in the U.S. were positive 24.6% for the quarter with positive comps of 22.6% in August, 28.5% in September, and 23% in October.  Our comps in August and September of this year were impacted by a shift in our Labor Day event. This year, our Labor Day event fell in fiscal September, and last year it fell in fiscal August. If we adjust for this shift, our monthly comps in the U.S. would be 24.7% in August and 26.4% in September. All 19 of our U.S. regions, as well as Canada and Mexico posted double-digit positive comps in local currency.  In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.2%, a decrease of approximately 30 basis points from last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted during the quarter by several factors, including product mix and pressure from shrink. Mix pressure from lumber alone negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 35 basis points in the third quarter. The decline in gross margin was partially offset by the benefit of reduced promotional events during the quarter. During the third quarter, operating expenses were approximately 19.7% of sales, representing a decrease of approximately 30 basis points compared to last year. Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. First, during the quarter we continued to support our associates with enhanced benefits in response to COVID-19 which totaled approximately $355 million, resulting in approximately 105 basis points of expense de-leverage. As you heard earlier from Craig, through the end of the third quarter we have spent approximately $1.7 billion on enhanced associate pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. We\u2019ve also made the decision to transition from our temporary weekly bonus program to permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline hourly associates. This will result in approximately $1 billion of incremental expense on an annual basis. We began making these adjustments in the third quarter and will continue to make the majority of them in the fourth quarter on a market-by-market basis. Second, we incurred approximately $60 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in approximately 20 basis points of operating expense de-leverage.  Third, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $325 million, an increase of approximately $48 million compare to last year. Finally, during the third quarter we showed strong expense control in other areas of the business and drove approximately 155 basis points of expense leverage. Included in this 155 basis points of leverage is approximately 70 basis points of pressure driven by accrued bonus expense primarily related to our current outperformance for our biannual store success sharing program and store and field-based management bonuses for the second half. The success sharing and store and field-based management bonuses are in addition to the $1.7 billion of enhanced pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. Our operating margin for the third quarter was approximately 14.5%, flat with the same period last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter grew by $49 million to $329 million due primarily to higher long term debt levels compared to one year ago.  In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.1% compared to 24.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.18, an increase of 25.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019.  At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $16.2 billion, an increase of $444 million versus last year, and inventory turns were 5.9 times, up from 5 times from the same period last year. Moving onto capital allocation, our long-term principles for how we think about deploying capital have not changed. After investing in the business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and through share repurchases.  Let\u2019s take a moment to talk about our first priority. We are committed to reinvesting in the business to drive growth faster than the market, and the acquisition of HD Supply strategically positions us to drive accelerated sales growth in a highly fragmented MRO space. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of The Home Depot will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of HD Supply common stock for $56 per share for a total enterprise value, including net cash, of approximately $8 billion. The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the tender of a majority of the shares of HD Supply common stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis and is expected to be completed during The Home Depot\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter, which ends on January 31, 2021. We plan to finance the acquisition with cash on hand and new debt. We also expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS in fiscal 2021 with potential for significant shareholder value creation over the long term.  During the quarter, we invested approximately $470 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditure and paid $1.6 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 41.6%, down from 45.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects our decision o temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the suspension of our share repurchase program back in March.  Turning to the macro environment, the strong demand we\u2019ve seen has continued. Comps have slightly accelerated in the first two weeks of November, reflecting an earlier start for our Black Friday and holiday events versus last year. We are encouraged by consumer sentiment and consumption trends which show home improvement receiving more than its historical share of consumer spending. Housing metrics are significantly stronger than when we entered this crisis. Turnover is rising, we see continued growth in household formation, and home prices are appreciating as inventory on the market hovers near record lows. Our customers tell us their homes have never been more important and they intend to continue their investment in the improvement of their homes.  While the current demand environment is strong, it is important to remember that we are not through the COVID-19 pandemic and we do not think it is prudent to extrapolate recent trends to predict future performance. Our main focus remains on meeting our customers\u2019 needs while prioritizing safety, and we believe that the investments we have made over the last several years have uniquely positioned us to capture market share regardless of the environment. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call, and we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks, good morning guys. I know you mentioned about the slight acceleration quarter to date, but I was wondering if what you\u2019ve seen in area where COVID cases have spiked, what do you think the business looks like as it gets colder and outdoor DIY gets tougher? You mentioned the low 20% ex-gardening comp - do you think that\u2019s a good proxy for the underlying trend, or would you expect the large pro to continue to improve and provide a benefit?\nCraig Menear: Chris, the first comment would be we see no correlation in the business as it relates to COVID cases. Our performance overall was actually really tight geography-wise, and we saw broad strength across the store. As Ted mentioned, we had an extended season because of the weather in garden, but we were extremely pleased with the performance outside of our outdoor categories, so we feel good about that. We\u2019ve seen the pro continue to recover and the large pro recover.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it, and then a couple follow-up questions on the investment outlook. It sounds like you\u2019re making progress on the store investments again. Will you end up on track versus the original plan, and what do you think about the degree at which investment dollars and SG&A are down year-over-year in 2021? Then now that you have HD Supply, was curious how many of the 150 or so new buildings that you\u2019ve planned to build under the current investment plan related to the MRO, and does the acquisition of HD Supply impact the outlook for building those buildings and capex related to that? Thank you.\nRichard McPhail: With respect to the investment outlook, as we\u2019ve said in the past, we have deferred certain investments that principally relate to investments made inside the store. A large number of those investments remain deferred. We started the year with a capex plan of approximately $2.8 billion. We have deferred less than half a billion dollars, so while I won\u2019t give you an exact number, I would say we will see deferral of, call it $300 million to $400 million from our original plans in 2020. Some of that may push into 2021, and we\u2019ll update you as time goes on; but I would say that overall, 2021 is going to be very similar to 2020 in terms of capex.\nTed Decker: And as it relates to the HD Supply asset base in total, obviously we\u2019ll take a look at that and we\u2019ll evaluate the combined asset base once this gets approval, and we\u2019ll move forward with what we think the best leverage point is to serve our customers and grow in the MRO space, which is a $55 billion fragmented market that we\u2019re pretty excited about.\nCraig Menear: If I could just take a minute, Chris, on what we\u2019ve accomplished, while we did push a bit into 2021, we\u2019re just thrilled that we are finishing the investment in our new look and feel of the store. Our sign packages will be done in all U.S. stores this year - I think that is probably the first time the brand standard across all the United States stores has been the same, maybe since our first two stores opened in 1979. We have completed all of our self checkout refreshes, we\u2019ve added storage to most of our stores for online pick-up, we\u2019ve implemented electronic sign labels in all our appliance departments, completely refreshed our color wall experience in our paint department, we\u2019ve completed the tool corral by brand standards in those leading brands in our tool business, and we\u2019ve also taken that to our outdoor power equipment and we\u2019ll be done early next year resetting all our outdoor power equipment, again by those battery platforms that are leading brands in the industry. We\u2019ve completed a ton of work despite some of the setbacks with COVID this year. The team just did a terrific job getting all that work done.\nChristopher Horvers: So then Richard, I know you mentioned capex deferring in, but I think originally \u201921 was from an opex perspective a source of funds - you know, incremental investment dollars down year-over-year versus being up the past few years. Do you still expect those investment dollars in opex to be down in \u201921? \nRichard McPhail: They\u2019ll be flat to down in \u201921, those specific expense dollars with respect to the investment program that continued alongside the deferred spending in \u201920. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Have a great holiday season.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning guys. You did talk about product mix as the primary factor for the gross margin decline. Was there much of an impact on gross margins from channel mix as ecommerce has outpaced store growth, or was it really all on the product side or were there any other factors we should be mindful of? Thanks. \nTed Decker: Nothing in particular, Scot. By far the big driver was the lumber penetration, the lumber mix, as strong as that business was. \nScot Ciccarelli: So as we--just thinking about this going forward, Ted, should we think about if we wind up seeing a more normalized mix, getting back to, let\u2019s call it flattish kind of gross margins, is that the right way to think about it from a cadence perspective?\nTed Decker: I think at this point with the level of uncertainty in the environment and the dynamics in the business today, we wouldn\u2019t give any forward expectations with respect to margins. We\u2019re running a very healthy business. We run it on a portfolio basis. You bring up channel mix - we run this as a portfolio and have for many, many years, and you\u2019ve seen the stability in our gross margin reflects that. Remember that over 60% of sales that are purchased on our digital assets are picked up in the store and have an identical mix in essence to our store mix, so that\u2019s where we stand. We\u2019re very comfortable with the mix of business we see.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay, very helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. There\u2019s a lot of moving pieces with Home Depot\u2019s longer run earnings power between any changes in consumer behavior, the incremental costs that you\u2019re paying your associates, the acquisition of HD Supply, channel mix, so relative to the 14% operating margin expectation you put out previously, recognizing that that\u2019s sale expectation and you\u2019re not providing longer run guidance, do you think the business can now earn a higher, lower, or about the same margin, knowing what you know today than what you had thought previously?\nRichard McPhail: Well, I\u2019d say a lot is dynamic, but many things stay the same. I think we have executed exceptionally well in terms of expense management throughout the year, and I think you can expect that from us in the future.  I think one thing I will just make sure that we clarify is how the shape of our investments to support our associates goes from 2020 into 2021. As we said, our expenses through the first three quarters of the year in support of our associates totaled approximately $1.7 billion. We are transitioning the nature of those investments into permanent wage investments during the fourth quarter, so if you think about the fourth quarter, we\u2019re not going to quite be down to that billion dollar annualized run rate as some of these programs leak into the beginning of the fourth quarter. We will be lower than the third quarter run rate, but add it to $1.7 billion and say that 2020 will likely end at a total of $2 billion of investments in our associates. Of that $2 billion, only $1 billion will remain in our cost base in 2021, so I think that\u2019s the most important fact with respect to our cost base. I\u2019d like to make sure we clarify that.\nTed Decker: And Michael, the only other comment I\u2019d add to that is everything that we\u2019ve been doing through our investment program is to try to position The Home Depot to grow faster than the market on a consistent basis no matter what the operating environment is, and to deliver incremental op margin dollars as a result. That\u2019s our focus. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get done.\nMichael Lasser: Great, that\u2019s a good segue to my second question, which is recognizing that it\u2019s very hard to prognosticate how demand for overall home improvements is going to shape up next year, if you had to make an estimate, what percentage of your categories or your SKUs do you think you\u2019ll be ordering inventories down next year?\nCraig Menear: First of all, the inventory planning for The Home Depot is on a very short cycle. We plan really week to week. We release orders every single day, and 70% of what we purchase is domestic goods and comes from short lead time-type performance, so we\u2019ll manage that on a day by day, week by week basis based on what we see in demand, and really we\u2019re not looking to extrapolate anything at this point from current performance. Our whole focus is on being able to be flexible and agile and adjust accordingly.\nMichael Lasser: Okay, I guess the heart of the question was do you think home improvement demand is going to grow next year?\nCraig Menear: Look, the only thing I can tell you at this point is when we talk to our customers and we do work on surveys, the customer tells us that the home has never been more important, maintenance in the home is going up as people spend way more time in their home, and they tell us there\u2019s a significant percentage of folks that say they are going to do a project within the next six months, so everything that we see at this point in terms of customer feedback would suggest they\u2019re going to continue to invest in their homes. \nTed Decker: And at the same time, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the environment. There are macroeconomic fundamentals that we\u2019re all going to be subject to, so I think if you think about it on a comparative basis, as Craig said, home improvement is a great space to be in at the moment, and as customers--you know, it\u2019s interesting. You look at the housing dynamics and you say when customers see their home price appreciate, they tend to invest more in their homes. Again, regarding our comments, because of the uncertainty in the macro environment, and so at this point we really can\u2019t comment on \u201921 but we do think there\u2019s a lot of confidence with respect to home improvement in our customers\u2019 minds.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. Thank you so much, and have a really nice holiday.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: Hi, thanks very much. Just a couple questions. I guess I\u2019m wondering with respect to your inventory, following up on Michael\u2019s question, do you actually think you maybe lost sales with inventory that was a little too lean, and then wondering how to think about inventory for the fourth quarter?  Then the second question I had is you obviously have more and more information on your DIY customer than you\u2019ve had for the last several quarters, given the ecomm penetration. I\u2019m wondering if you could give a little more color on what the general demographic is looking like now and what the biggest shift or changes that you\u2019ve seen from an age or income cohort.\nTed Decker: On inventory, Karen, it would be hard to gauge some of the lost sales opportunity. That would have likely been more of a Q2 impact for us because we did go in with a little more conservative approach when the pandemic hit. As you know, we limited customer hours, limited customer counts, and we also pulled back on inventory. Since that time, though, between the merchandising team and the supply chain team and the sourcing teams and transportation team, they really have just done an incredible effort flowing product into the store.  As I said in my prepared remarks, we improved in-stock levels every week of the quarter. Our inventory grew over $400 million from the prior year, and that was our first year-over-year increase that we have seen this year. In pure volumes, if you look at our accounts payable, that gives you an indication of how much goods we have flowed into the buildings - it\u2019s over $3 billion from our low point, so the in-stocks still are not exactly where we\u2019d like them to be, but incredible improvement.  The work the merchants have done, even though the in-stocks still have some ways to go, by working on the right SKUs with our supplier partners, updating plan-o-grams and the like, we believe we have the product and the type of items in the store that our customers are looking for. As it relates to online trends, you\u2019re absolutely right - our online business, we couldn\u2019t be happier with the performance of our digital assets, and remember we are an interconnected business, so with everything I\u2019m about to say, remember that over 60%-odd of our goods are picked up in our store. Nonetheless, our interconnected business grew by 80%, the penetration was 13% to the business, the sales--you know, that translates to nearly $2 billion of sales growth in the quarter for our online business. Our visits are up dramatically - we\u2019re up in mobile, desktop, mobile web. Our conversion is up despite hyper growth in app and mobile web, that tend to have lower conversion rates than desktop. Our app downloads are way up, our active app users are way up, our orders are up. My Account - these are folks who are setting up an account with Home Depot, so obviously we know them better when they set up an account or weigh up.  Millennials are highly engaged with The Home Depot. You asked customer profile - our pros are highly engaged, our B2B website is seeing record volumes and engagement with our pro customer. I\u2019ll stop there, but it is a robust interconnected digital environment right now at The Home Depot.\nKaren Short: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know you gave your comments on HD Supply, but I wonder if there was any more color you could give on the source and magnitude of any synergies, and how much debt might be taken or raised for the deal?\nCraig Menear: We\u2019re really excited about what the combination of these two MRO businesses will bring to our customer. We think we\u2019ve got the opportunity to create significant shareholder value creation through that combination. We\u2019re not going to talk about the degree of accretion, but we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll see earnings per share accretion in 2021.\nTed Decker: Kate, what we\u2019re excited about is if you--you know, these are rough numbers. If you think about $130 million occupied households in the United States, about 80 million of that is kind of owned households, single family. There\u2019s 50 million that is rental, and of the 50, about 30 million give or take is in the multi-family operations type business. That is a huge opportunity for The Home Depot to continue to grow not only on the MRO side but as we build relationships with customers on the MRO side, we build relationships to be able to participate in capital refreshes of those facilities as well, which is something that we\u2019re pretty focused on. We\u2019re super excited about the opportunity that comes with this MRO space.\nKate McShane: Okay, thank you. I wonder if I could ask an unrelated follow-up question, just in regards to your seasonal business that you do in the fourth quarter. Is there any way to dimensionalize or size how big of a business that is becoming for you in the fourth quarter?\nCraig Menear: I\u2019m trying to remember off the top of my head. We talk about seasonal breakout of outdoor categories. The fourth quarter is the lowest of the year, right Ted?\nTed Decker: Yes, so generally it\u2019s been shifting a little bit this year given the extended garden season and as engaged as customers have been. But we usually think of Q4 of low 21%-ish penetration of what we would deem outdoor business, and that very much is the low point with Q2 traditionally being the high point - think of mid-30s, so that\u2019s sort of the range of changes in the business.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks, good morning everyone. First, a question for Richard. You mentioned a few macro factors, and I\u2019m trying to extrapolate it - it sounds like you\u2019re a little bit more bullish on those than maybe you were in prior calls. Can you give us any sense--I know you said directionally getting better. Can you give us a sense what these inputs could look like for 2021 just in terms of magnitude, whether it\u2019s home price appreciation, housing turnover, etc.?\nRichard McPhail: In my earlier comments, I said we\u2019re really pleased with the current level of consumer sentiment and consumption in the economy. I\u2019m not going to make a prediction on where those macroeconomic levers go in the future. \nTed Decker: The only thing, Simeon, that I would say is I think the last number I saw is somewhere in the 2.7 months of supply in housing, and the historical average on that is six months, so you\u2019d have to believe that\u2019s going to continue to hold up home values. I think home value improvements have been the surprise this year\nRichard McPhail: I think it\u2019s a positive housing environment. We\u2019re not extrapolating that into expectations for sales, principally because of the uncertainty in the macro environment. We are optimistic and current conditions are certainly favorable for home improvement, but there is uncertainty. We\u2019ll learn a lot in the fourth quarter. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay, fair enough. Then my follow-up, based on the results by customer type, right - the pro customer\u2019s coming back, can you talk about the backlog that you\u2019re seeing? Are you seeing the jobs that are coming back to normal, indoor jobs, and I think--it may have been asked earlier, but the transition from outdoor to indoor, how is that taking place?\nCraig Menear: Simeon, you\u2019re right - the pro has been coming back. We see double-digit comps in pro, we did last quarter as well. Small pro is leading the large pro. We\u2019ve seen that large pro really strengthen in the larger metro markets, and our services business, if you look at that as a benchmark to pro business, we have one of the larger backlogs of to-be-installed sales jobs that we\u2019ve ever seen, and as you\u2019d imagine, a lot of this is special order goods, so getting the bespoke special order made and shipped to the particular job and then getting the labor to install that job continues to be a bit of a pressure, and more so in certain markets, leading to that large backlog. But if what we\u2019re seeing our services business translates to what the larger pros are also seeing, that would be a sizeable backlog. \nSimeon Gutman: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Hey, good morning. Great quarter. Can you talk about where you are in the supply chain build-out that you\u2019ve outlined over the past few quarters, and maybe how much of a delay COVID\u2019s caused and the degree to which you can make that up in \u201921?\nCraig Menear: Sure. Largely COVID hasn\u2019t had a big impact, and I\u2019ll let Mark comment on where we are.\nMark Holifield: Yes, good morning - Mark Holifield here. We\u2019ve continued to open facilities through the pandemic. I\u2019ve been incredibly impressed that the team has been able to keep our program on track in terms of the one supply chain initiative. In Q3, we opened up about 11 MDOs - those are market delivery operations. We now have three flatbed delivery centers open and we\u2019ve got a very solid pipeline for \u201921 that we\u2019re working, so we\u2019re very much on track with the one supply chain initiative.\nChuck Grom: Okay, that\u2019s great. Then just maybe one for Richard. You spoken a lot over the past year about the ongoing margin headwind from shrink, and I realize maybe you\u2019ve seen limited in your ability to do some of the inventory, the physical inventories, but where are we in that life cycle? It seems like it was an issue again here in the third quarter. Any line of sight on when you think the shrink could flip from a negative to a positive?\nRichard McPhail: Well, at the beginning of the year, we said that impacts from our initiatives weren\u2019t really going to be seen until the year 2021. It takes time to roll these out. We did anticipate at the beginning of the year that we would see pressure on a year-over-year basis. The results through the third quarter have been essentially consistent with our original expectations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with DA Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Baker: Hi, thanks. A couple. One, Halloween being strong, does that typically act as a leading indicator for Christmas, or even Thanksgiving; in other words, if people are buying the big blow-ups for Halloween, does that translate into big Christmas or--I don\u2019t know if you do a big Thanksgiving business on that, but does that translate at all to what we should expect in the fourth quarter? \nCraig Menear: I think what we saw in the Halloween business probably is more correlated to what we\u2019ve historically seen in storm markets. When you have a hurricane hit, our thinking years ago was that, oh jeez, we needed to pull back on all that product because that wouldn\u2019t be where the customer focus was, and we needed the space for rebuild type product. What our customers told us was no, actually we\u2019re looking for some kind of normalcy and we actually want to buy that product from you, and I think that\u2019s exactly what we anticipated and are seeing through the holiday programs, as Halloween was the strongest event we\u2019ve ever had. We had anticipated in the beginning of the year--because that\u2019s a long cycle product that you purchase well in advance, we had anticipated that the customer would want to engage in holiday, and purchased accordingly. \nMichael Baker: Do you have that same expectation for Christmas? Did you purchase that similarly?\nCraig Menear: Yes, that\u2019s what I mean. We bought into the whole holiday d\u00e9cor for the entire season - you know, Halloween all the way through Christmas, because we anticipated the customers were going to want some kind of normalcy in their life.\nTed Decker: The holiday set has been set now for Christmas for several weeks in the store now, and as I said, we\u2019re very pleased with the early engagement in sales in the program.\nMichael Baker: Got it, understood. If I could ask one more follow-up on the Home Depot Supply, thinking back a few years to an analyst day that you had, I think you implied that you--or said that your share in MRO was about 5%, which would have implied about $2.5 billion, and then we add on 3-plus for Home Depot Supply, you\u2019re getting about $5 billion or about 10% share. Is that the right way to think about it? \nTed Decker: We think it\u2019s about a $55 billion market that we plan with a combination of our current MRO business and what will be added with HD Supply.\nMichael Baker: And what do you think your share is of that $55 billion?\nRichard McPhail: We won\u2019t speak on HD Supply\u2019s financial information. The transaction hasn\u2019t completed yet. We\u2019ll refer you back to theirs. But as Craig said, call ours roughly $2 billion.\nMichael Baker: Understood, we can do that math. Thank you, appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Good morning. With your digital sales up 80% in the quarter, I think that would imply that your in-store sales accelerated in Q3, and I\u2019m curious if you would attribute this more so to the impact of easing some of the early COVID restrictions on stores, or do you think there were other factors like better in-stocks or incremental demand from pro customers that you would call out?\nCraig Menear: I think it\u2019s all of the above, Zach. We\u2019ve learned how to better operate. We ended up turning control of constraints in stores over to our store managers who are closest to the situation on the ground versus a company-wide approach. We did that at roughly the beginning of the quarter. We improved our in-stock position, as Ted indicated. We saw overall improvement with our pro customers, and our smaller pros have been steady, our larger pros improved, yet there\u2019s still opportunity for them, and we saw our services business improve overall. I think there\u2019s a number of factors that led to this performance in the quarter, so we\u2019re pleased with the trends that we\u2019re seeing in the business right now. \nZach Fadem: Got it, and then lastly on the decision to reacquire HD Supply, could you talk about why you think the timing makes the most sense now, particularly with some of their end customers like hospitality and facilities impacted due to COVID? On the strategic investments, curious how you would think about prioritizing that incremental investment dollar across the MRO business relative to your existing strategic plans?\nCraig Menear: Look, I\u2019d say a couple things. First of all, over a period of time, the HD Supply business came down to essentially the MRO maintenance facility business that it is today, that we just put the offer in on, and so it strategically lines up with what we\u2019re trying to get accomplished in the MRO business much more so than it did a few years ago. From a timing standpoint, that\u2019s the logic there. We look forward as we close this deal, hopefully during our fiscal year end here, then we\u2019ll determine the go-forward approach and how we allocate and prioritize, but we\u2019ve got to get this deal closed first.\nZach Fadem: Got it, thanks Craig. I appreciate the time.\nCraig Menear: Sure.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Forbes: Good morning and thanks for fitting me in. I was hoping to maybe expand on the compensation enhancement for the hourly associates. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible, Richard or Craig, if you could discuss whether the investments are concentrated in absolute wage rates or if there\u2019s other aspects of the compensation or benefits that are being changed as we think about the cost structure going forward.\nCraig Menear: Steve, we believe that our associates are a competitive advantage to The Home Depot and they\u2019re critical to the overall customer experience. This investment is essential in wage, and as we do everything as it relates to our associates, that\u2019s done on a market-by-market basis overall. But yes, you can think of it as largely--it\u2019s wage.\nSteve Forbes: Then as a follow-up to that, should we expect any incremental pressure stemming from higher employment costs for the full time associate pool, or maybe--I don\u2019t know if you can discuss the best way to think about 2021. Richard, you mentioned $2 billion transitory versus $1 billion permanent, but are there any other potential cost factors we should be considering in our models as it pertains to the full time pool?\nRichard McPhail: It\u2019s all of our frontline associates, essentially, whether they\u2019re full time, part time, doesn\u2019t matter. \nSteve Forbes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. \nIsabel Janci: Thank you Christine, and thank you everybody for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-08-18 14:48:03", "content": "Operator: Greetings.

Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel and thanks to all of you for joining our call this morning. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all of those that have been directly impacted by COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact have forced us to change the way we live, work and interact with each other. Though these tough times have been unquestionably challenging, as we mentioned in the first quarter, we have navigated this crisis by aligning our decisions and actions to some of our most important values, do the right thing and take care of our people. Our focus has been and continues to be on two key priorities, the safety and well being of our associates and customers, and providing our customers with the products and services they need at this time. In the first quarter, we had to adjust our stores to an environment that promoted social and physical distancing, and we did this by implementing a change to store hours, limiting the number of customers in store and eliminating traffic driving incidents, as well as operational changes like floor markings, signage and plexiglass shields. In the second quarter, we continued to adapt based on our learnings and ever-changing environment. Our team continues to work to promote a safe shopping environment. We have made several adjustments in the quarter to our operating approach. First, we expanded our operating hours from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. This action was taken to relieve the end of day bottlenecks we observed in some stores, while we were operating under more restrictive hours. Second, we modified the national approach that we had in the first quarter to limit the number of customers in stores and now are taking a more localized approach by relying on our store managers and field teams to closely monitor safety and implement customer limits as needed. Third, we announced that masks or facial coverings are required for all associates and customers in our U.S. stores and other facilities. Given the ongoing demands and complexity of the current environment, we\u2019ve continued to focus on taking care of our people by extending weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers. Through the second quarter, we have spent approximately $1.3 billion on enhanced associate pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. Additionally, the company\u2019s first half performance resulted in a record of payout for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. I\u2019m incredibly proud of our associates for the many ways that they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during this unprecedented time. Our team has demonstrated ongoing flexibilities to effectively operate in this dynamic environment, while also executing to deliver record breaking sales. Sales for the second quarter were $38.1 billion, up 23.4% from last year. Comp sales were up 23.4% from last year, with U.S. comps of positive 25%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.02 in the second quarter. These record results were driven by broad based strength across our stores and geographies. As Ted will detail both ticket and transactions were up double-digit in the quarter and we saw healthy growth from both our Pro and DIY customers. During the quarter, we saw customers take on projects throughout their homes. From deck building to painting projects, landscape work and home repairs due to increase wear and tear. Clearly our customers engaged with home improvement in a meaningful way. That being said, as we discussed in the first quarter, we\u2019re cautious to extrapolate trends from the first half of the year into a forecast for the remaining of the year, particularly given the tremendous amount of uncertainty we face with regards to the duration and continued impacts of the virus. So while we can\u2019t predict the sales trajectory for the back half of the year, we do know that for many of our customers, the home has never been more important. Our recent customer survey work tells us that customers have a continued willingness to take on both indoor and outdoor projects in the near-term. Customers are consolidating the number of retailers they visit and are blending the physical and digital elements of the shopping experience more than ever before. As a result, the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant. Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructures have supported record web traffic on a consistent basis for the past several months. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximate 100% in the quarter and more than 60% of the time our customers opted to pick up their order at a store. The accelerated growth of our interconnected and digital offerings has given us the opportunity to showcase in a very condensed timeframe new capabilities in different ways to engage with The Home Depot that customers may not have been fully aware of. The rate at which customers are authenticating with us is also accelerated, which provides us with a unique opportunity to know our customers even better. This is critical as we continue on our journey to offer a deeper level of personalization and further enhance the interconnected shopping experience. That being said, the step change in demand across our digital platforms is not without its challenges, particularly from a delivery and fulfillment standpoint. We\u2019ve been able to leverage investments we have made in the scale and flexibility of our supply chain network to relieve some of the pressure. This is exactly what we did during the quarter, when we temporarily transitioned one of our recently opened market delivery centers or MDCs to a direct fulfillment center or DFC, which primarily fulfills online orders. The investments that we have made in the underlying infrastructure and systems supporting the MDC, coupled with a strong cross-functional alignment across the organization enabled us to make this conversion just a few short weeks. The net result for our customers was the reduction in lead times for orders flowing from our direct fulfillment network. We are focused on continuing the momentum of our strategic investments to enhance the interconnected shopping experience and position ourselves for continued share capture over the long-term. At the same time, we know that we must remain agile and flexible to execute against the demands of the current environment. Through it all, we will continue to lead with our values and I could not be more proud of the resiliency and strength of the team has demonstrated as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances together. I want to thank our incredible associates and supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serve our customers and communities. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. I too want to thank all our associates and supplier partners for their relentless focus on serving our customers. During the second quarter, we saw unprecedented levels of engagement from both our DIY and Pro customers. Our team satisfied the strong demand by working together in a flexible and agile manner, while also prioritizing safety. As an example, we decided to cancel our Annual Memorial Day event and adjust other spring events as we didn\u2019t want to drive even more traffic into already crowded areas for our store, like garden and paints. We also removed most of our off-shelf merchandising displays in order to support social distancing. Our teams were incredibly flexible and worked in a cross-functional manner to coordinate changes. We altered marketing plans, social media product flow, product selection and space allocation. Our merchants, suppliers, marketers, supply chain, merchandising execution and store team remained agile throughout the quarter and focused on our customers. We are fortunate to have the best supplier partners in the business, leveraging our tools and analytics we work together to make real-time adjustments to our assortments. In many instances, we introduced alternative products and reduced assortments to the highest demand SKUs that our partners could supply most effectively. As an example, to support in-stock levels for high demand items such as cleaning products, we work with suppliers to streamline production on key products, sizes and fragrances. And as you heard from Craig, the investments we\u2019ve made in our supply chain over the last decade, allowed us to be more flexible than ever in flowing product to the right geographies. During the second quarter, 13 of our 14 merchandising departments posted double-digit comps in the quarter led by our lumber department, our kitchen and bath department posted high single-digit comps. During the quarter, comp average ticket increased 10.1% and comp transactions increased 12.3%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven by both an increase in basket size, as well as customers trading up to new and innovative items. In addition, inflation and core commodity categories like lumber positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 61 basis points. The strength of our comp transaction growth was driven by consistently strong in-store and online transactions. During the second quarter, big ticket comp transactions are those over $1,000 were approximately 16%. We saw very strong performance across a number of big ticket categories, like, appliances, riding lawnmowers and Patio Furniture. However, this strength was partially offset by softer performance in certain indoor installation heavy categories, like, special order kitchens and countertops. We saw strong sales growth for both our Pro and DIY customers, with DIY sales growing faster than Pro sales. Sales to our Pro customers accelerated meaningfully compared to the first quarter and grew double digits compared to the second quarter of last year. Looking deeper into our Pro sales, we saw notable strengths with our smaller pro customer. As markets continue to reopen, we see increasing demand from all our Pro customer cohorts. We continue to lean into our strategic investments to create a Pro ecosystem that encompasses professional grade product, exclusive brands, enhanced delivery, credit, digital capabilities, field sales support, HD rental and more. We believe our differentiated ecosystem will continue to drive deeper engagement with our Pro customers Turning toward DIY customers. Our DIY customers are reengaging with their home and with The Home Depot in a meaningful way and they are engaging across the store. Well, we\u2019ve seen strong demand with exterior projects like building decks, sheds, fences and gardens, we\u2019ve also seen strong growth with interior projects, like, hard surface flooring, interior lighting and painting, to name a few. We firmly believe that our One Home Depot strategy is creating a best-in-class interconnected shopping experience. We are building unique capabilities that let our customers engage across our digital platforms, our updated physical stores and our enhanced delivery experience. And our consonants in these new capabilities led us to change our tagline and marketing efforts to how doers get more done. During the second quarter, new and existing customers set record levels of engagement across our new capabilities. The rate at which our existing customers are adopting new channels to engage with The Home Depot more than doubled here today. And we also saw a third of recently acquired customers reengaged with The Home Depot for another purchase in a different department. During the second quarter, our mobile apps are record number of downloads and we saw significant growth in conversion rates across all digital platforms. These results confirm our belief that we\u2019ve been making investments in the right areas of our business and that those investments are resonating with our customers. Let me give you an example to help illustrate our enhanced capabilities and options for customers. Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve enabled multiple fulfillment options, including buy online pickup in store with convenient pickup lockers, buy online deliver from store with our express car and van delivery, and most recently, our curbside pickup option. As customers accelerate their adoption of an interconnected shopping experience, we\u2019ve seen increased usage of these different fulfillment options. During the second quarter, we saw triple-digit growth across all these platforms. Another example is our HD Home business. As part of our strategic investments over the last three years, we\u2019ve been leaning into several home d\u00e9cor categories. As consumers shop fewer and fewer retailers, our research show that our customers are increasingly looking to homedepot.com to help the project completers like room d\u00e9cor and textiles. We\u2019re investing to create a better frictionless online shopping experience for d\u00e9cor. We are showcasing our collections, enabling shop by room and highlighting our capabilities and product offerings with HD Home. With record levels of traffic on homedepot.com, we\u2019ve seen significant outsized sales growth with our HD Home assortment. All the investments across the business make us more flexible, as we continue to navigate this fluid and dynamic situation. As we look to the back half of the year, we\u2019ll be working with our supplier partners, as well as our cross-functional teams to satisfy our customers evolving home improvement needs. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone joining the call today and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. In the second quarter, total sales were $38.1 billion, a 23.4% increase from last year. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $200 million. Our total company comps were positive 23.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 24.6% in May, 25.7% in June and 20.4% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 25% for the quarter, with positive comps of 27.3% in May, 27.3% in June and 21% in July. As you heard from Craig and Ted, the strong demand we saw was broad based with a high degree of performance uniformity among our three U.S. divisions in Canada. All 19 of our U.S. regions posted double-digit positive comps and our Canadian business reported record sales. Mexico\u2019s performance was impacted by a lag in COVID-19 cases relative to the U.S. and Canada, and as a result, Mexico\u2019s performance was negative in the beginning of the quarter, before turning to positive growth at the end of the quarter. In the second quarter, our gross margin was 34%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin was driven by several factors, including a benefit from a reduction of annual events during the quarter. This benefit was partially offset by the mix of products sold and pressure from shrink. During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales of approximately 18.1% increased approximately 10 basis points compared to last year. Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. First, during the quarter, we continue to support our associates with enhanced benefits, which totaled approximately $480 million in the second quarter, resulting in 125 basis points of expense to leverage. Second, we incurred approximately $110 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal protective equipment for our associates and customers, and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in approximately 30 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Third, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, an increase of approximately $40 million compared to last year. We are committed to completing our strategic investments. However, given the priority around safety and the complexities of the operating environment we find ourselves in, we\u2019re deferring certain in-store investments and now expect some of the projects we initially earmarked for fiscal 2020 to be completed in fiscal 2021. And finally, during the second quarter, we showed strong expense control in all areas of the business and drove approximately 145 basis points of expense leverage. Included in these 145 basis points of leverage is approximately 90 basis points of pressure driven by accrued bonus expense related to our significant outperformance for our biannual store success sharing program in store- and field-based management bonuses for the first half. Our operating margin for the second quarter was approximately 15.9%, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter grew by $54 million to $337 million, due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than one year ago. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4%, compared to 24.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.02, an increase of 26.8% compared to the second quarter of 2019. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories declined $1.2 billion to $13.5 billion, driven by the significant and steady demand we saw during the quarter. Inventory turns were 6.1 times, up from 5.1 times last year. Moving on to capital allocation, while our long-term principle of returning excess capital to shareholders remains intact, we believe that in this unprecedented environment, it is appropriate for us to maintain a strong liquidity position. During the quarter, we invested approximately $445 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures and we repaid approximately $1.75 billion of long-term debt. We also paid $1.6 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Computed on the average beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 41.1%, down from 43.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects our decision to temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the suspension of our share repurchase program back in March. Looking ahead, through the first two weeks of August, comparable sales growth remains at levels similar to total company\u2019s second quarter comp sales. Our customers tell us that they plan to continue to invest in a wide variety of projects to maintain and enhance their homes. However, given the degree of uncertainty in our external environment, we cannot extrapolate current observations to predict future performance. As a result, we are focused on operating with discipline and flexibility in order to grow market share regardless of what demand patterns emerge. And despite the significant uncertainty in the current environment, we do believe in the resilience of home improvement demand over the long-term. The home typically represents our customers\u2019 largest asset, the housing stock is aging and we believe the capabilities we\u2019re investing in across our interconnected platform will position us well to continue capturing market share in any environment. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call and we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks, everyone. Good morning. My first question is a little medium to longer term. It\u2019s on the margin potential of the business. The environment now is pretty fluid and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d describe it is still competitive, when you laid out the One HD plan, most of the plan was recouping some of the margin that you would be investing -- making -- to make investments, but you never really baked in sales upside, and by default, you never really promised or committed to more margin. Can you talk about does that change and it\u2019s not about those margins go up over time, but does it create the potential for margins to trickle up over time or you\u2019re going to be steadfast on reinvesting and maintaining a certain margin level going forward?\nCraig Menear: Simeon, as we shared last December, everything we\u2019re doing in terms of the investments that we\u2019re putting into the business is to be able to position us to outgrow the market for the long-term and the whole objective behind that is to be able to drive incremental op margin dollar and bottomline growth. That\u2019s really the focus that we have. We\u2019re not -- we\u2019re really not worried about how the basis points or rate falls. This is all about incremental op margin dollar growth.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe sticking with you, Craig, you mentioned in the article, I think, it was this week, right, correlations don\u2019t work right now and they don\u2019t apply, which makes sense. Can you talk just two components of that? How could -- how does the surge in home improvement could a transition from spring, summer into fall? And do you expect these conditions -- these surge conditions to persist until there\u2019s a vaccine?\nCraig Menear: I mean, it\u2019s really so uncertain. We don\u2019t know the answer to that, which is why we can\u2019t really extrapolate current performance to future performance. What we do know is, again, the home has never been more important to the customer. We\u2019re all spending lots of time there. We\u2019re seeing things that need to be done or things that you want to be done. There\u2019s additional wear and tear, and we\u2019re clearly seeing the customer engaged in a very strong way right now. The most important thing for us, as we think about the future going forward, is we operate in key areas on a pretty short cycle. So think labor planning, think inventory planning. Those are short cycle activities for us and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on. How do we remain flexible and adjust? Assuming that, they are asking thing as we had really unbelievable demand for multiple quarters or multiple months in a row. As Richard shared the quarterly, monthly comps and the team was able to react to that and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on being able to do.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks. Good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question and I guess you practice what you preach with doers getting it done. My question is on the Pro business, which you mentioned was up double digits. Can you qualify the spread between what you think your Pro business did and what you think your DIY business did? And with that being said, is there an argument and do you subscribe to it that the Pro business is being held back by consumers not wanting outsiders in their home and don\u2019t want to be dislocated from their home in this current time. So there is a pretty visible path to future growth as the Pro business takes over for the strength from the DIY business right now?\nCraig Menear: Michael, we\u2019re obviously not going to split out the numbers on cohorts for obvious reasons. But we were super pleased that we saw double-digit growth with the Pro, as well as incredible strength with the DIY customers. They\u2019re clearly engaged with projects as well. I\u2019ll let Bill jump in with a little bit more color as to what we\u2019re seeing in terms of major markets where there\u2019s still a little pressure as it relates to permitting that?\nBill Lennie: Yeah. Hey, Michael. It\u2019s Bill Lennie.\nMichael Lasser: Hi, Bill.\nBill Lennie: We did see good Pro sales growth across our cohort towards all end markets in all geographies. There was notable strengths with the low spend Pro. They were less impacted with a downturn in Q1, but continued to rebound and accelerate in Q2. The high spend Pro also continued to rebound in, I would see that, as being an outcome of permitting and job inspections coming back online and there are areas where homeowners are becoming more comfortable with having Pros and service providers in their homes. There are some end markets that haven\u2019t totally recovered. I\u2019ll give you one example and that would be multifamily property managers. Obviously, there\u2019s low returns on the units, they have less access to the properties and they still remain in more of a break fix mode, holding back major rehabs and capital projects. But with that said, even in multifamily Pro customers, we\u2019ve seen upturn in a rebound in sales to those cohorts.\nMichael Lasser: Thanks very much. And my follow-up question is on the gross margin, Richard you gave a little bit of detail on some of the moving pieces, noting that mix and shrink were still dragged in the quarter. So how should we think about and how should we be calibrating our models for when shrink is going to get better and what point do you think the promotional environment will move from being supportive to more normal?\nRichard McPhail: Michael, thanks for the question. So for the quarter, the most significant influence were really the cancellations of annual events during the quarter. If you look at the pressures again, as we stated, there was some pressure from mix and from shrink. But really those pressures were consistent with what we expected at the beginning of the year and what we saw in Q1. As you know, shrink is a -- an item that we have pushed a few initiative towards last year and this year. Those efforts are ongoing. We will see benefits from that over time. It takes a while for that to work our way through the system. But again, shrink and mix, those components really worked out where we expected they would have even at the beginning of the year.\nCraig Menear: And as far as\u2026\nMichael Lasser: Thanks.\nCraig Menear: \u2026promotions, though, we\u2019ll continue to have promotions and events, but they will continue to be modified. So when you think at the beginning of the year, our Spring Black Friday event and Memorial event, we essentially cancelled those. We had a modified more modest 4th of July event where there was some promotion not as deep. There was some in-store activation in our event spaces. I would say, going forward, we continue to have modest modified events, but a net benefit with promotions.\nMichael Lasser: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. Maybe just to focus on the additional workforce benefits that you\u2019ve noted here, I don\u2019t know, Richard, if you can go into a little more detail about the $480 million or is it simply just tied to the weekly bonuses? And then just revisit sort of what the current thinking is around the continuation of these bonuses and what have you committed to and sort of how do you sort of think about balancing the cultural impacts right of it with obviously the commitment you have towards safety, et cetera?\nRichard McPhail: Thanks for the question, Steven. So if you take a look at the approximately $480 million that we invested in enhanced benefits in the quarter, you take a look at that and say about $360 million of it would represent spend on benefits that continue into the third quarter with the vast majority of that $360 million being in the form of weekly bonuses to associates. The remainder of that -- the remaining $120 million that we expensed in Q2 represented benefits like enhanced overtime pay that have not continued into the third quarter. So again, of that second quarter about $360 million continues in the third quarter. It\u2019s worth pointing out that in a 23% comp environment, there are more hours. There are more associates eligible for those weekly bonuses. We certainly were not planning at the beginning of the quarter for a 25% or 23% comp environment. So that number is going to naturally be a little bit higher in Q2 because of that. So that\u2019s the breakdown of our associate expense. And it\u2019s something that we review on a continuous basis. We think that that expense was prudent and appropriate in the second quarter, and we\u2019ll continue to review it as circumstances develop.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you. And then just a quick follow up, right, as we look at lumber inflation here and think about the puts and takes on the model. I don\u2019t know if you sort of just give us your current thinking about the potential implications as we look out to the third quarter here, given that you called out mixed. I mean, how do we sort of contextualize the P&L impacts?\nRichard McPhail: Well, on lumber we called out a commodity benefit in Q2 of 61 basis points. Now lumber in the last several weeks of the quarter and into the first two weeks of this quarter has hit all time record highs, each of framing and panel are over $700. They are up essentially about 115% DIY. But I would say, a big piece of that was when COVID started. None of us knew where this was going to go and the mills took a conservative approach and largely backed off harvesting trees and cutting logs. That product started up again about mid-quarter of Q2 and we\u2019re starting to see much better flow in lumber. So I\u2019m not going to predict lumber prices, but with more supply coming into the marketplace, hopefully, we\u2019re going to tame these $700 levels. Although, we do have substantial support with housing and all the projects that Craig referred to, certainly, in pressure-treated decking, just a robust decking boom, but we should see some moderation, but the unit demand, even with these higher prices has remained double-digit and incredibly strong, so to strengthen the Q3, certainly right now, but where it shakes out ultimately in margin not certainly.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions on the e-comm, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the behavior with the DIY customer versus the Pro. I guess, with respect to the growth rates for each, maybe a little color on ticket and also behavior on buy online and pickup in store for each segment? And then, I guess, I\u2019m just curious, broadly, which segment you think you\u2019re gaining greater share, whether they\u2019ve did gained [ph] greater share within 2Q? And I have one other quick question.\nCraig Menear: Yeah. Karen, on the e-comm business, again, we\u2019re not going to split out the cohort in terms of the numbers, but what I\u2019ll tell you is that, we saw a great engagement with both the Pro and the DIY customer, and we\u2019re seeing accelerated engagement, as Ted called out, with the capabilities that we have with both the Pro and the DIY customer, and so we\u2019re very, very pleased with that and tremendous growth there. And we really believe that the current environment has allowed us to accelerate the exposure, the capabilities we\u2019ve built in a tremendous way. So we\u2019re very, very pleased. That -- it\u2019s the project nature of the business for both the Pro and the DIY customer that\u2019s driving, helping to drive the growth in the e-comm world. When you think about doing a project, customer\u2019s blending the physical and digital worlds, we have an expanded assortment in the digital world. As Ted called out, when it comes to completing a room, our HD Home categories of completion, we\u2019re seeing tremendous growth there as the customer purchases that product online. That obviously has a tendency to be more DIY-oriented as they complete their room. But we\u2019re super pleased with what we\u2019re seeing with both the Pro and the DIY customer.\nTed Decker: And I would say, clearly, with the numbers online effectively doubling that business in the second quarter, increasing penetration over 14%. As you can imagine, every metric is positive. The traffic across all our properties, the active customers, the app downloads, the conversion rates all very, very strong. Our actual active customers, the number of active customers also doubled. So as Craig said, our job going forward now is to just not reap the benefit of this activity in Q2, but with all these new customers engaging across all The Home Depot capabilities, we\u2019re very closely watching reengagement rates and I mentioned a couple statistics in my prepared remarks, but we\u2019re seeing are people shopping across departments. Are they engaging in other capabilities? What is their duration before there is repeat engagement with a capability or indeed a purchase? And the name of the game for us is engagement and that is really what\u2019s all behind how doers get more done. The more our customers engage with our capabilities, whether it\u2019s in the store, self checkout, app downloads, delivery, search, tool rental, using our lockers, using our calculators, every time our customer engages and another capability that we\u2019ve built out that stickiness, that\u2019s repeat business and that\u2019s customer loyalty. And a quarter like this has just been terrific and advancing our initiatives and we\u2019re working very hard to keep that momentum going.\nRichard McPhail: And Karen, you asked about market share, obviously, market share is hard to calculate for us, only as good as the public data we have at our fingertips. But if you do look at census data and you look the next categories where we compete 444 and 4441. This space has grew significantly in the low-teens. We obviously grew much faster than our space. So we captured considerable share we believe based on publicly available data.\nKaren Short: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And I just had one quick question, in terms of the commentary, you made a comment on trading up, you were seeing trading up, I was just wondering if you could just give a little more color on that?\nCraig Menear: Just continued interest with our customers both Pro and DIY to engage with innovative products and it certainly can be tools, but it can also be pressure-treated lumber with higher efficacy. It can be stain resistance carpeting, I mean it\u2019s really across the business where we offer benefits and attributes to our product and the customer shows a willingness to trade up to that.\nKaren Short: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Thanks. Good morning. Great results. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on category performance, areas of relative strength, I know you call out, 13 out of 14 businesses being strong? And then if you could also contextualize the opportunity for HD Home as we look ahead?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. We -- really the strength we had in the business was throughout the categories, as well as throughout our geographies. And when you think about, Ted talked about the fact that, every single category of goods was double-digit with the exception of high-single digits in kitchen and bath, which is a pretty invasive indoor type category. We were super pleased with that performance and that growth in the second quarter. And when we look at it on a geography basis, for example, every single region all top 40 markets were double-digit crop growth.\nChuck Grom: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Craig, when you look at the strengths in the business is always the concerns about some pull-forward of demand versus the undercurrents of sustainability. So when you look ahead to the back half, I know you talked about August being strong, but when we think about the back half and even into \u201821, how do you thinking about these mix in dynamics?\nCraig Menear: I mean, we -- at this point, as I said earlier, we\u2019re looking at what\u2019s customer behavior, what\u2019s the sentiment, we\u2019re monitoring that incredibly closely. We are -- we operate on short cycle and the things are most critical for that, which is our labor planning and inventory planning. And we really don\u2019t know how to extrapolate from where we are to what the future is. What we know is, we have to rely on the capabilities that we\u2019ve built to be flexible and to adjust to be able to deal with whatever gets thrown at us and that\u2019s really what our focus is, Chuck.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Thanks. Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Hey. Good morning. So relative to Q1, it looks like your ticket growth was similar in Q2, but curious if you could talk through the dynamics that drove transaction growth from negative 4% in Q1 to over 12% in Q2. How much did the traffic increase? What was your own doing given the Q1 restrictions? And then what would you attribute to just evolving consumer behavior and the return of the Pro customer?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. I think a significant portion of the change was in terms of the constraints that we put on the business in Q1, which were pretty severe. I mean, when you close down 25% of your customer facing hours, that\u2019s going to have an impact. And when you kill all of your spring promotions and major events that historically drive big amounts of traffic to the stores, that\u2019s going to have an impact. We obviously continue to learn and adjust based on the learning and feedback from our field teams and that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve done and made the adjustments that I called out in my proposed remarks in the second quarter and that certainly helped contribute to driving transaction growth.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And\u2026\nTed Decker: I would just\u2026\nZach Fadem: Oh!. Go ahead.\nTed Decker: No. Just -- I was just going to add was, the reduce traffic were not just our limiting the hours but our Pro and consumer customers alike were consolidating trips, while transactions were down and ticket was up and that was driven by units per transaction. People were definitely consolidating trips. So part of Q2 not only did we ease and did many shelter-in-place and customer\u2019s willingness to visit stores all ease. We still saw terrific ticket growth in units but just eased a little bit on units per transaction although still incredibly healthy.\nZach Fadem: Thanks, Ted. That\u2019s helpful. And on the supply chain, curious if you would call out any headwinds or constraints from out of stocks or inventory availability, whether that was an issue at all in Q2. Does -- it doesn\u2019t look like it was, but curious if you anticipate any ongoing headwinds from lumber or other product availability as we get to the second half of the year?\nCraig Menear: Look, when you run 20% plus comps, you certainly put pressure throughout the supply chain network from vendor community through our own supply chain. So certainly there\u2019s pressure there. What I would tell you is, again, as Richard called out, with 20% comps for each of the months in a row and every single week during the quarter being double-digit growth north of 20%, the team was able to adjust and to adapt to that and did a terrific job, for sure.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Craig, thanks. Appreciate the time.\nCraig Menear: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with a question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. So with all the sales reaccelerating from July\u2019s are a strong trends, I\u2019m curious if July was particularly impacted either from supply shortages, be it lumber or something else that we keep hearing about or maybe specific changes to your promotional plan?\nRichard McPhail: Thanks, Scot. It actually was not supply chain or demand. It was a function of really two factors. And I think the headline here is, if you normalize for these two effects, June and July looked almost identical from a comp perspective. So, the first element here was our pullback on event, own events, annual events, which had a greater impact in July than for June. And the second dynamic here was that we saw an earlier start to hotter temperatures in June than we saw last year. So there were some comp benefit in categories like ACs and fans in June versus July when you do the year-over-year compare. So again, when you look at those two months and you make those adjustments, they were almost identical from a comp perspective and that\u2019s carried on to the first two weeks of the third quarter.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. That makes a lot of sense, Richard. And then you also talked about the need to delay some of your planned investments, obviously, the multiyear plan. Can you provide some color on maybe the magnitude of costs that may have to get pushed out to \u201821 from \u201820?\nRichard McPhail: Sure. So, I\u2019d say, first of all, we don\u2019t see the need to spend any more than we originally planned. It\u2019s simply the dynamic of pushing spend into \u201821 as we make sure that we\u2019re focused on safety in our stores. So just to give you a little bit of context, think about our capital plan for the year, which is around $2.8 billion, we might defer several hundred million, probably, less than $0.5 billion that could be pushed into next year. Depending on the size of that deferral, 2021 CapEx may look more similar to 2020 levels. And from an expense perspective the deferral is lower than the capital deferral.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nCraig Menear: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. I want to think about the categories a little bit more as well. Can you talk maybe broadly about what indoor comps versus outdoor comps looks like, particularly as we try to get a sense of what underlying demand might look like as we get deeper into the fall?\nCraig Menear: Let me start with one comment and that is if you back out our garden business, our seasonal business, we were north of 20% comps even with that backed out. So this isn\u2019t a quarter that was dependent upon our seasonal business. And I\u2019ll let Ted share some color on how we\u2019re seeing the engagement indoor.\nTed Decker: Yeah. Chris, it was really strong demand across the business, clearly, more DIY in the interior projects as we\u2019ve talked about the Pros and having third parties in the house and permitting and the like. But short of the installation heavy categories, flooring and paint and plumbing and electrical, all strong, kitchen and bath that we said it was just under double-digit. Our bath business would have -- it was double digits. So, again, it was the heavy installation of kitchen-oriented product, but just super strength. And add that we\u2019d like the medium and longer term implications of this, because there have been questions for years now, would the Gen X and millennial engage to the same level of home improvement, and when you think, The Home Depot had a big part in teaching the baby boomer to gain confidence and take on DIY. What we\u2019re seeing is that all generations are engaging in Gen X and millennial. And when you start with that first DIY project, it may be a garden, it may be painting. Painting has traditionally been the number one DIY project. And once you accomplish that first more modest task, you gain confidence and you take on the next task and the next task and they become bigger and then you need more sophisticated and broader breadth of tools to continue the more ambitious projects you\u2019re taking on. So, this is what we saw with the baby boomer in the growth and the establishment of this industry. And the -- one of the bigger medium- and long-term benefits of this is, we know that this next very, very large generation is a very active home improver.\nChristopher Horvers: That\u2019s great. And then a couple of quick ones on the expense side, can you talk about some of the investment levels that you\u2019re pushing out relative to the $40 million year-over-year investment in 2Q? How do you think about that in the third quarter and fourth quarter and also, in case you didn\u2019t touch it, how much the PPP -- PPE and COVID cost continue in the back half? Thank you.\nRichard McPhail: Sure. On the expense portion of our investment program, obviously, we are operating in a very dynamic environment. It\u2019s not going to -- the shift is not going to be material to the company, but again, we\u2019re managing that as circumstances warrant. With respect to PPE, we incurred costs of approximately $110 million with respect to associates and customer safety. The majority of that were related to masks and PPE. That expense became material in the second quarter as we mandated them for our associates and our customers. And we\u2019ve become more efficient in the distribution of those masks, so that this expense is going to moderate in the third quarter.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Best of luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. Thank you. Just with your last quarter you had given us some color around sales growth in urban markets versus rural and then the gap there. I mean, did that gap close this quarter and are you seeing your urban markets getting closer to the overall chain average?\nCraig Menear: And again, we saw in all of our top 40 markets double-digit growth and it\u2019s one of the most narrow performances we\u2019ve seen by region, by market, in quite some time.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. Thanks.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Mike Baker with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Baker: Hi. Actually, it\u2019s Mike Baker now at D.A. Davidson. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the regions. You had said, they are all very consistent, but is there any difference at all in the areas where we\u2019re seeing a resurgence in some of the COVID cases or not? And then, I guess, a follow-up and related to that is, other retailers have talked about seeing a big benefit from stimulus. I guess, the continued strength that you guys are seeing would suggest that, perhaps, stimulus didn\u2019t really help that much, you\u2019re not dependent on stimulus, but could you provide some color on that? Thank you.\nCraig Menear: So, look, in terms of the overall benefit from stimulus, hard to quantify. But we have to believe that there are some -- when customers have more money in their pocket, there is some benefit to that. So, we don\u2019t kid ourselves to think that that didn\u2019t have some kind of impact. But, clearly, the customer is engaged around their home and looking to get things fixed, looking to take on projects as they have time to be able to do that.\nRichard McPhail: And with respect to the COVID environment, we\u2019ve really found no relationship between COVID case counts and sales performance.\nMike Baker: Thanks. And any color on areas where back-to-school has started versus some areas where kids aren\u2019t going back to school yet?\nRichard McPhail: No.\nMike Baker: Very consistent.\nCraig Menear: Not see any.\nMike Baker: All right. Thank you. Appreciate that.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and thank you all for joining us today.

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy and our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who have been directly impacted by COVID-19. I also want to thank all of our incredible associates and supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities in this time of need. And while the purpose of the call today is to update you on our first quarter results, I thought it would be helpful to explain how we are thinking about and making decisions at The Home Depot. When our founders started the company over 40 years ago, they did so by first defining the type of culture and value system that they wanted to promote. These values are the foundation for our business and provide the lens through which we evaluate our decisions. Anchoring to these values in this time of crisis has never been more critical. Our decisions and actions are rooted in a commitment to do the right thing, to take care of our people, and be there for our customers and communities. To that end, as the situation around COVID-19 has evolved, our focus has been and continues to be on two key priorities, the safety and well-being of our associates and customers, and providing our customers and communities with essential products and services. The team\u2019s alignment around these two objectives has enabled critical speed and flexibility when making decisions and implementing a number of changes across the business in a rapidly evolving and incredibly fluid environment. I would like to briefly touch on just a few of the early and decisive actions that we took in support of these primary objectives. To promote a safe environment for associates and customers, we implemented a number of operational changes starting in mid-March. We have adjusted our store hours, closing earlier than usual to give our associates more time to properly clean and sanitize and restock our shelves. We took a proactive and early stance on limiting customer traffic in our stores to better maintain physical and social distancing protocols. At the height of our spring selling season, we also made the decision to cancel our annual Spring events, including Spring Black Friday. This was not a decision that we took lightly and yet we made it confidently giving our belief that having this event would drive footsteps to our stores and directly undermine our commitment to prioritizing safety. To take care of our associates, we expanded our paid time off for all hourly associates that can be used at their discretion and will be paid out at year end if unused. We also are offering additional paid time off for associates who are 65 or older are deemed to be at higher risk by the CDC guidelines. We have instituted weekly bonuses for our hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers. We are providing double pay for over time work, and we have extended dependent care benefits and waive related co-pays. Our more than 400,000 orange blended associates are the heartbeat of The Home Depot and supporting them is a core value of our company. Beyond the grounding that our culture and values provide and the actions we have taken to support them, we believe that The Home Depot is uniquely positioned to weather COVID-19. Nobody could have predicted what has unfolded since we spoke with you 3 months ago on our earnings call in February, and yet the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy that were reinforced then are perhaps even more in focus and relevant today. Investments we have made over the years in our stores, market-leading digital assets, flexible supply chain, and a world class merchandising organization have allowed us to quickly adapt to shifts in customer needs, preferences, and behaviors. Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have supported record level web traffic for several weeks without disruption. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 80% in the quarter, and more than 60% of the time, our customers opted to pick up their orders at a store. We were able to extend our in-store focus capabilities to curbside pickup in the U.S. in a matter of days offering customers an additional choice with respect to fulfillment. In the case of our Ontario stores in Canada, this curbside capability was turned on essentially overnight when it became the only option to remain open and operational with those stores operating under these circumstances for more than a month. The flexibility and agility of our business model, coupled with our focus on execution and strong partnership with our suppliers, helped deliver solid results in the quarter and gave the Board the confidence to declare a $1.50 per share quarterly dividend. Sales for the first quarter were $28.3 billion, up 7.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.4% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 7.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.08 in the first quarter. Richard will walk you through the details in a moment, but I want to stress that while we were pleased with the results in the quarter and we see an engaged customer, there is significant volatility. Month-to-month and even week-to-week, we saw extreme ups and downs across different categories and geographies. As a result, we are cautious to extrapolate trends from the first quarter into a forecast for the remaining of the year, particularly given the tremendous amount of uncertainty we face with regards to the duration and continued impacts of the virus. Despite the many unknowns of the current environment, we are confident that we have taken the steps to ensure that we will emerge from this crisis stronger and even be better positioned for the future. Though this crisis is unparalleled in size and scope, we have built a reputation through our history of doing whatever it takes to be there for our associates, customers, and communities in the most critical times, and this situation is no different. Once again, I want to thank our incredible associates and express how grateful and proud I am of the resiliency and strength that our teams have demonstrated as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances together. This reminds me of the words of our founder, Bernie Marcus, that have never resonated more deeply than they do today. If you take care of our associates, they take care of the customers, and everything else takes care of itself. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig and good morning everyone. I also want to start by thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for the incredible collaboration over the last several months. Supplier relationships and partnerships matter, and during the times of crisis is when they matter the most. One of the actions we took early on when COVID-19 was impacting the supply chain in China was to establish regular and frequent contact with our suppliers, both internationally and domestically. As cases increased in the U.S., our suppliers helped source the essential products that our customers and communities needed. We established an effective plan, shifted resources as needed, and worked on getting the right products to the right stores across the country. While in-stock levels varied from store to store and region to region, our focus remains on replenishing and restocking high demand products as quickly as possible. We are grateful for our strong strategic partnerships. Our supplier partners are helping us in many ways, including supplying essential products for our own use. Let me give you an example. Very early on in the pandemic, we reached out to PPG, one of our key paint suppliers for help. We asked PPG if they could help supply hand sanitizer for our store associates. They quickly converted several of their manufacturing lines and within a few short weeks, they produced an initial order of approximately 100,000 gallons of hand sanitizer. They are planning to produce three times that amount for future in-store use that will help our associates for the remainder of the year. This is just one of many examples. And I want to thank PPG and all of the other supplier partners that have stepped up to help us prioritize the safety and well-being of our associates and customers. The challenges we faced as a result of COVID-19, including the most fluid operating environment we have ever experienced have further reinforced our strategy of the One Home Depot interconnected shopping experience. As a direct result of our investments across the business over the last decade, our teams were able to make decisions quickly and adapt to changing local government mandates in customer behavior. And as you heard from Craig, we did this while focusing on two priorities keeping our associates and customers safe and continuing to serve our communities with the essential products and services they need for their homes in places of work. Our continued investment in our interconnected capabilities has positioned us well as customers turned online for their shopping needs. The shelter-in-place orders rolled out across the country in mid to late March. We saw our digital businesses accelerate from approximately 30% growth in early March to triple-digit growth by the end of April. In fact, the daily traffic to homedepot.com reached new records towards the end of the quarter. During the last three weeks of the quarter traffic to homedepot.com was consistently above Black Friday levels and as a result of our continued investment in our digital infrastructure and with the great work of our technology teams, we have provided continuous service to our customers and our conversion rate continued to increase. During the quarter, we continued to leverage our different fulfillment capabilities like buy online, pickup in store in our enhanced delivery capabilities whether it be on a flatbed truck, a box truck, or our car and van service. Our BOPUS and Deliver from Store fulfillment options saw triple-digit growth in the first quarter. In fact, the flexibility that we have built into our systems allowed us to quickly rollout the new fulfillment option for our customers to buy online and pickup at our stores through a contactless curbside pickup option. Looking at the first quarter in total, we saw positive comps in 11 of our 14 merchandising departments. Comps in kitchen and bath, flooring and millwork, departments with a heavy reliance on in-home installation were negative during the quarter. During the first quarter, we saw three distinct phases of sales performance. The first phase covered the first 7 weeks of the quarter. During this phase, we saw strong sales across the store with all departments showing mid single to double-digit comps. As customers prepared shelter-in-place, we saw particularly strong growth with certain categories like cleaning in safety and security, but we also saw growth above our expectations in other core categories. The second phase of our sales performance relates to the last week of March in the first 2 weeks of April. During this phase, as the number of shelter-in-place orders were issued across the country, we are among the first essential retailers to take immediate and decisive action geared at limiting customer traffic in our stores. These actions included reducing store hours, limiting the number of customers in our stores and canceling our annual spring events, including Spring Black Friday. In addition, we made the decision to suspend certain non-essential installation services such as kitchen remodels. During these 3 weeks, we saw negative comps in most departments. Finally, during the last 3 weeks of the quarter while maintaining safety protocols around distancing and proactively restricting customer traffic in stores, we saw strong comps across most of our departments as customers focused on a number of home improvement projects. We continue to see significant pressure in products requiring installation services like kitchen and bath and flooring. During the first quarter, comp average ticket increased 11.1% and comp transactions decreased 4% reflecting the lower traffic that we just discussed. The strength in our comp average ticket was driven by a notable increase in basket size. Core commodity categories like lumber and copper did not have a material inflationary impact on our comp average ticket during the first quarter. During the first quarter, big ticket comp transactions are those over $1,000 were up 2.5%. We saw strong performance in big ticket categories like appliances and riding lawnmowers. However, this strength was offset by pressure in categories like special order kitchens, countertops and flooring where we intentionally limited these installation services and customers\u2019 homes. Sales with both our DIY and Pro customers grew during the quarter, with DIY sales growing faster than Pro sales. We continue to have a high level engagement with the Pro. However, certain states and municipalities restricted in-home activity, which had a direct impact on some of our Pro customers. In addition, certain social distancing actions we took during the first quarter also served as a headwind to Pro activity. As we look ahead, we are focused on continuing to provide essential products and services to our customers and communities in a safe and responsible way. The investments we have made across our business, has helped us to be flexible and agile in this fluid and dynamic situation. We will continue to adapt and improve the ways in which we serve customers in this new environment. And with that, I would like to turn the call over Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Ted and good morning everyone. We appreciate everyone joining the call today and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. This was certainly a unique quarter with COVID-19 dramatically changing our operating environment, but it has also reinforced that the investments we have made in the business over the last decade have been the right ones. They have allowed us to be more flexible and agile than ever before. And we have taken unprecedented actions to respond to the virus primarily focused on supporting our associates keeping them and our customers safe while providing a central products to our communities. Today, I will review our consolidated results for the first quarter and will provide some color in the context of the three distinct periods that Ted mentioned we observed. I will also review some of the direct actions we took as a company to support our associates and further strengthen our capital structure. In the first quarter, total sales were $28.3 billion, a 7.1% increase from last year. Our total company comps were positive 6.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 9.3% in February, 7.1% in March and 4.2% in April. Comps in the U.S. were positive 7.5% for the quarter, with positive comps of 9.7% in February, 7.5% in March and 6.4% in April. From a geographic perspective, all three of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps and 17 of our 19 U.S. regions had positive comps in the first quarter. The two exceptions were our New York Metro and South Florida regions. New York and its surrounding areas were negatively impacted given the outsized impact that the virus had on the region and our south Florida region was negatively impacted by our stores in Puerto Rico being closed for a period of time in accordance with local mandates. During the pre-COVID period in February and stretching into mid-March, comps were double-digit positive in the U.S., with relatively uniform strength across all regions. As we moved into late March and early April, we experienced peak shelter-in-place mandates across the country. During this time, we implemented early and decisive measures to restrict customer traffic in our stores, which had a direct negative impact to our sales, most acutely felt in higher volume stores in densely populated urban areas. Over the course of these 3 weeks shelter-in-place mandates and self-imposed limitations on traffic pressured our weekly performance to double-digit negative comp sales with higher volume stores underperforming lower volume stores by over 3 percentage points in certain areas. And finally, during the last 3 weeks of April and continuing into the first 2 weeks of the second quarter, we have seen a significant acceleration to double-digit comp sales growth, with strong performance across most of the store, as customers turn to repairs and home improvement projects. As a result of ongoing measures to promote social distancing practices in our stores, customer limits continue to constrain sales in our higher volume stores, but we have flexed our operating model to improve our ability to serve these strong levels of demand. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34, 1%, a decrease of 12 basis points from last year. This decrease was primarily driven by changes in the mix of products sold and continued pressure from shrink. This pressure was offset in part by favorability and supply chain expenses and by the cancellation of our Annual Spring Black Friday event this year. During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 190 basis points to 22.5%. This increase primarily reflects our decision to extend enhanced benefits for our associates totaling $850 million in incurred and accrued expense reflecting the provision of additional paid time off for all our hourly associates which can be used any time during the year and will be paid out at year end if our associates choose not to use it. The provision of incremental additional paid-time off for associates considered to be at higher risk based on CDC guidelines. Weekly bonuses for our hourly associates, double pay for overtime hours worked and other benefits, these enhanced benefits created approximately 300 basis points of expense de-leverage during the quarter. In addition, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $270 million, a slight increase versus last year creating 10 basis points of expense de-leverage. Finally, we showed strong expense control in all other areas of the business as we navigated the quarter and drove approximately 120 basis points of expense leverage on that basis. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 11.6% compared to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2019. If we were to exclude the 300 basis points of de-leverage related to the COVID-19 expenses to support our associates, our operating margin would have been approximately 14.6%. Interest and other expense for the first quarter grew by $34 million to $307 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4% flat with the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $2.08 compared to $2.2727 in the first quarter of 2019. The $850 million of expense related to enhancements we made in support of our associates negatively impacted our first quarter diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.60. During the quarter, we opened 1 new store in Mexico and 1 in Puerto Rico bringing our total store count to 2,293. Selling square footage at the end of the quarter was 238 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, inventory turns were 5x, up from 4.7x last year. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 40.8%, down from 45.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects higher long-term debt balances than 1 year ago as we took steps to enhance our liquidity position during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. And I will take a moment to comment on those actions and a little more detail. We began the first quarter with a very strong liquidity position and we moved early in the quarter to strengthen that position. In mid-March, we suspended our share repurchase program indefinitely. Prior to that suspension, we had repurchased approximately $600 million or 2.5 million shares of outstanding stock. In late March, we upsized our A1 P1 commercial paper program from $3 billion to $6 billion. In conjunction with upsizing our commercial paper program, we expanded our revolving credit facility capacity from $3 billion to $6.5 billion. As of today, we have no commercial paper outstanding and our credit facilities are un-drawn. And finally, on March 30, we raised $5 billion of staggered maturity long-term debt with an average coupon of approximately 3%. This average coupon is below the average coupon of our overall debt portfolio. These actions were important to ensure we had more than adequate liquidity during this period of uncertainty. In addition, we took actions to reduce nonessential activity in our stores and as a result postponed some of our strategic investments that touch our stores directly, including changes to our front-end and resets of our merchandizing base. While these actions reflect our focus on social distancing, we remain committed to our One Home Depot strategy. Fiscal 2020 marks the third year of our strategic investment plan to create a seamless and frictionless interconnected experience. These investments are designed to leverage and extend our competitive advantage and have already begun to prove their value as we pivot to serve our customers in new ways. Now, I will comment on how we are thinking about guidance. Recall that the fiscal 2020 guidance that we provided on our fourth quarter call in February excluded any impacts from COVID-19. Our performance to-date has surpassed our initial expectations and it is also disconnected from traditional metrics like GDP, which we have historically used as a foundational element of our sales guidance. As a result of this and the level of uncertainty that exists with respect to the impact of Covid-19 on future economic activity and customer demand, we are suspending our fiscal 2020 guidance until further notice. Our stance is not a reflection of current demand for home improvement but rather a reflection of the broad range of potential outcomes for the economy and our business. Our strategic investments have positioned us well to continue to serve our customers with the essential products they need for their homes in places of work. Our company is in a strong financial position and we have taken steps to further strengthen that position. We will continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and we believe we will emerge from this COVID-19 as a stronger team and a stronger company. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call and we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot of taking my question. I know it\u2019s uniquely difficult to quantify, but if you use the spread in the difference in performance between your high volume stores and the rest of your chain as a guide, what do you think the overall impact from metering, limiting promotions and not having installation in the first quarter ?\nCraig Menear: Michael, it\u2019s hard to determine, we took a crack. Richard, do you want to fly through?\nRichard McPhail: It is hard to determine. If you just look at sort of traffic limitations that we imposed, if you look at the restricted operating hours and caps on customer accounts in our stores, I can\u2019t give an exact number, but it would be several points of comp impact to the quarter.\nMike Lasser: Several points of comp, meaning more than a couple hundred basis points just to clarify that, and then you are not referring to several hundred basis points?\nRichard McPhail: You are in the right neighborhood, several hundred basis points of comp.\nMike Lasser: Okay. And to what degree as the strong sales at Home Depot have experienced as of late, simply pull forward sales from future period? And as part of that, are you planning for negative comp in any given quarter of this year?\nCraig Menear: Michael, I mean, spring is always one of those scenarios where you have first quarter, second quarter kind of how much happens in the first quarter. Is there a pull forward if you have an early great spring. Those are dynamics that we deal with every single year, and we have seen strength as we have begun the second quarter and we are not planning for any negative comp in the business.\nMike Lasser: Thank you very much. Stay safe and good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning guys. And again, also hope everyone is well. Obviously, current demand is strong, you just talked about that, and I would also think that there is going to be a greater focus on wallet share from consumers towards home related investment, because you\u2019ve all been under lockdown for the last 2 months. Now, on the flipside, we\u2019ve had a pretty sizeable contraction in mortgage credit since early mid-February. So, I understand I am asking an opinion or a view here, but when you kind of look out over the next 6 to 9 months, how do you kind of net out those two forces, because one is obviously positive and one is potentially meaningfully negative?\nCraig Menear: Again, we started the year with an overarching strong housing environment. It\u2019s hard to determine what impacts are going to play out as a result of this at this stage of the game. I just don\u2019t know how we predict that. Clearly, the current demand is strong and the capabilities that we have built really fall around flexibility, and we are going use that flexibility to drive engagement with the customer on an ongoing basis.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. And then if I could sneak in another one then, Craig. I am just curious your average ticket was so strong, but big ticket sales were up only about 2.5%. I think that\u2019s kind of an unusual disparity between those two figures. So, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of the average ticket performance? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: Yes. Let me \u2013 I will make a comment, and Ted you can add anything. Look, I think in this situation customers were very focused on making sure that they reduced their exposure in terms of going into retail environments, and here we\u2019re really focused on getting everything they needed in one trip.\nTed Decker: Yes, Scot, if you can imagine, we look at the breakdown in comp and items per basket etcetera in every permutation of ticket. And what we experienced is as Craig said people were limiting trips to the store. So, our smaller tickets or smallest tickets had a negative comp -- transactions had a negative comp. And while we had a positive comp in the over $1,000 of 2.5% as I said, remember that was limited by all the special order and installation businesses that we purposefully curtailed. What we are particularly excited about was the performance from the $200s to $300s to the $500 ticket. Those are your core basket building project-oriented tickets that were extremely strong across the whole store.\nScot Ciccarelli: Very helpful. Good luck guys.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning, everyone. A little bit of a twist on the prior questions. The virus obviously makes the backdrop very uncertain. In the past, Home Depot has offered a framework for a potential next recession, it was hypothetical. I think it was comps flattish in a downturn assuming the downturn wasn\u2019t driven by housing and then given how big maintenance and repair is. I realize the virus is unpredictable and that\u2019s a variable no one can predict, but does the economic backdrop argue for that type of scenario? Any perspective I realize with this variable it\u2019s hard. And Craig, did you say for Q2, obviously you are not expecting negative, but that wasn\u2019t for the whole year, that comment just for Q2?\nCraig Menear: Yes, we are not planning for negative. It\u2019s obviously very uncertain as to how the year plays out in total. We\u2019re not planning for negative comps in Q2 or for that matter for the year at this point. We\u2019ll watch carefully and see how this all plays out and react accordingly. And again, the flexibility that we have built in our business should give us the ability to react.\nRichard McPhail: And if you just \u2013 if you go back to your recession question, we entered the year with a healthy housing environment. We haven\u2019t seen anything in that housing environment that\u2019s changed materially, and typically when you look at recessions that are non-housing led for us, the performance decline is much more shallow, more of a flat-type environment. But again, this is a unique situation and the duration of the situation is one of the more important dynamics that just can\u2019t be predicted.\nSimeon Gutman: Yes. Fair enough. And then, my follow up is, so you\u2019ve been open throughout this crisis. You\u2019ve seen a surge, you\u2019ve adjusted how you\u2019ve operated, and there is probably more adjustments to come. Any thoughts on the margin profile? I know it\u2019s going to be hard to talk about structural change and how it relates, but any other puts and takes in how you think about the long-term margin of the business?\nRichard McPhail: Yes. I would say, margin was sort of relatively where we would have anticipated it prior to COVID. We run up a portfolio approach at The Home Depot, and you have puts and takes every quarter. I wouldn\u2019t say that our long-term view of margin has changed from what we\u2019ve seen in the situation.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks. Good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just talk about e-commerce just a little bit, obviously you called out an extremely strong growth rate and it looks like e-com is now around 17% of sales, which is almost double what it ended \u201819 at. So, wondering if you could talk a little bit about what the composition was and whether not do you think you gained share with a particular demographic? And I\u2019m wondering what your thoughts are just in terms of the stickiness with respect to e-com and home improvement just going forward?\nCraig Menear: Yes. Our penetration did jump to just under 15% for the quarter, so we had strong penetration, and we gained a lot of new customers exposed to homedepot.com. Now, we \u2013 as Richard said, we run this on a portfolio. And so, there are heavy engagements in both channels, customer using dot-com to order goods can be then 60-some-percent of those picked up at a store. Ted, I don\u2019t know if you have any further?\nTed Decker: Yes. Karen, the performance of online, as Craig said, the penetration increased to 15%. We had a 79% growth, accelerating throughout the quarter. So we started strong at the beginning of the year, similar to the growth in the prior years, accelerated into triple-digits in the last weeks and meaningful triple-digits, and the growth is really across all categories. What\u2019s particularly encouraging is the number of new customers and the opportunity in the future. We more than doubled our number of customers when we look at our customers from repeat customers, 6 to 12 months, less than 12 months, 12 to 24, reactivated over 24 months, brand new customers, every one of those segments was healthy and effectively doubled. Again, purchasing categories across the entire store, the engagement with e-mail and My Account signups tripled the normal run rate as we went through the quarter. Our app downloads nearly doubled from their normal quarterly and weekly run rate. So, just terrific engagement across the business in our devices, and we\u2019re very encouraged with this new and reenergized online customer base to work with these folks and contact them, engage with them in the future.\nCraig Menear: Karen, one other comment I will make on it is, the great news is, the majority of this growth came through earned channels. We didn\u2019t have to go pay for it.\nKaren Short: Yes, no, that\u2019s very helpful, and I appreciate that. I just wanted to ask a slightly separate follow-up. Obviously, we have \u2013 you talked about the TAM \u2013 $650 billion TAM in the past. I\u2019m wondering if you have a sense of what \u2013 how big, I guess, the smaller and more fragmented competitor base is in terms of the total dollars, meaning, will they actually make it kind of the other side of it? And how much of an advantage you might have in terms of taking share from weaker more fragmented players?\nCraig Menear: So, I believe you broke up a little bit there, but I believe you were asking about the $650 billion TAM. And so, what we\u2019ve always said is, at our size, there is plenty of share out there, plenty of fragmentation, you think about categories like flooring which are truly penetrated more greatly by the small mom and pops. There is plenty of share out there to grab.\nKaren Short: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Hi, good morning and hope everyone is well. Just wondering if you guys could talk about the cadence of the Pro and the DIY business separately throughout the quarter and if the reacceleration that you spoke about in May, the double-digit increase was seen in both camps?\nCraig Menear: So, clearly the DIY customer is reengaged with DIY, there is no doubt about that, very strong DIY business. What was interesting is, we actually saw the Pro grow in the quarter, but we did see bifurcation in the quarter with the Pro as we moved into the different phases that Ted and Richard described. And the smaller Pro actually performed well throughout the quarter with more pressure on the larger Pro. And Bill if you want to jump in and provide some additional color there?\nBill Lennie: Yes. Thanks, Craig. So, Chuck, we saw more sale impact in the highly shelter-in-place regions or zones versus the states that had moderated or no actions in place. So, the Pros definitely faced some headwinds from the state mandates. We also had some restrictions in the form of inability to get permits issued or job site inspections completed so they can move on with their project. And finally, there were some headwinds there with homeowners just having the reluctance to have crews working in their home when they were sheltered in place. As Craig said, high spend Pros were more impacted. That makes sense if you think about them being more concentrated in metro areas likely or they have some of those mandates impact their business, but also larger jobs and more crews more likely to be impacted from the inability to get permits or job inspections. I would give you one additional point of reference though, and I would draw that parallel to our services business. If you look at job cancellations, they are running at historic trends which really means that more customers have just pushed their jobs and haven\u2019t canceled the work. So, as these mandates are lifted, we are seeing the Pros come back to work. It\u2019s just a slower recovery than what we have seen from consumers.\nChuck Grom: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, just on the $850 million of cost that you incurred in the first quarter, is there a way to handicap what you think that could look like in 2Q and maybe in the back half if you decide to continue to pay your employees a little bit more?\nCraig Menear: Well, I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on what the second quarter or the rest of the year will look like, but maybe if I gave you some color around the $850 million that would give you clarity on how to think about it. So, there are really kind of two categories of that spend. The vast majority of the $850 million reflects expense related to the extension of paid leave. So, in mid-March, we extended additional paid leave to all of our hourly associates and subsequently extended paid leave for associates who would have been deemed at-risk. For both those groups, if leave is not taken, we fully committed to pay it out during the year. A portion of the paid leave has already been taken, but we have fully accrued for all of the remaining leave eligible to be taken. So, the vast majority of that $850 million has already been accrued. Then we have expenses that are paid as earned by our associates. This bucket of expenses was about $150 million of the $850 million. And so, these are really in the form of the weekly bonuses we\u2019re paying to our associates as well as the enhanced overtime rates that we\u2019re paying. We began payment of those benefits roughly halfway into the quarter. So that $150 million was paid over roughly half a quarter. We are continuing the payment of those benefits into June, and we will continue to review the continuation of those payments as the situation develops. Does that help?\nChuck Grom: Yes. I guess, is there any way to heading up what the accrual portion of the extended time would be? Because I think that\u2019s the point I\u2019m getting at. You\u2019ve essentially captured forward costs here in the first quarter.\nRichard McPhail: If you want to think very roughly, you\u2019ve got the $150 million that is sort of expensed as incurred. So that leaves about $700 million. Of that $700 million, that is loosely associated with paid leave, about $150 million has already been utilized, but again, we fully accrued for the remainder of the paid leave that our associates are eligible for under this enhanced program. So it is already reflected in our Q1 financials.\nChuck Grom: Yes, makes sense. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A few follow-up questions so, first, on the last question, just in terms of like the ongoing expense obviously in a socially distancing world, retail is changing, there is an article last week around what McDonald\u2019s is changing, and these expenses are going to stick. So, how does the higher sanitation cost and different things that are going to stick around for the next year? Is there a number that you could associate it with that? And then, on the Pro business, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in areas that are opening up? Do you have a sense of what the Pros order book looks like, it sounds like people are completing jobs, but do you have any sense or any view on what the new business coming into that Pro looks like?\nCraig Menear: Let me just comment on the Pro and I will turn it over to Richard for the cost element. On the Pro, as Bill mentioned, in our own services business, which is some of our best Pros, we\u2019re not seeing a high cancellation rate of the jobs, it\u2019s just a postponement. The customer still wants those to go on. The assumption that we have because we don\u2019t have visibility necessarily into it other than talking the Pros And anecdotally, the assumption that we have is that, that is holding true throughout the Pro business, and we think that the \u2013 as we see the volume with the Pro pickup, it\u2019s an indication that the same thing is happening in their business that\u2019s happening in our services business.\nRichard McPhail: And to tackle the first part of it so, if you think about our expense performance and you remove the $850 million of benefit enhancement, Chris, we actually under-spent our expense plan by over $120 million in the quarter. And that is net of the increased operating costs required, whether it\u2019s in the form of cleaning or other operating costs. And so, there are gives and takes in that. We\u2019re actually quite pleased with our expense performance. And credit to our amazing team \u2013 our amazing store operations team and all our associates out in the field for running the business in this way.\nChristopher Horvers: And so, as \u2013 so it doesn\u2019t sound like any of that is like a shift in timing, the cost control is something that\u2019s in the business.\nCraig Menear: It\u2019s really one of those \u2013 one of those incidents.\nChristopher Horvers: Right. And then, my final question is, I think this is the latest into a Home Depot call, the word weather hasn\u2019t coming up \u2013 come up at all, which is always interesting. Can you just talk about the weather that you saw in the first quarter and perhaps even quarter-to-date? Obviously you have the bathtub effect, like so things can push around the shelter-in-place and work-from-home, do you think pull forward some of the seasonal business and any comments on sort of regionality in terms of where the weather as philly broker is still on the come?\nCraig Menear: Chris, as Ted and Richard described, in the beginning \u2013 in the first seven weeks of the quarter, clearly there was a good early strong beginning of spring. And so, that was a great beginning to the quarter. From there, everything changed. And so, we have no way of extrapolating. At this point, there\u2019s probably more demand than you would typically see in a given quarter because people are spending on other things. So, even if there was early purchasing, I\u2019m not sure that has, based on what we\u2019re seeing right now, has any impact whatsoever.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks very much. Best of luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. I wanted to clarify the 200 basis point comp impact you called out. Is that the total comp left on the table from lower promo and enhanced social distancing? And do you think there were any offsets here in terms of categories that were pulled forward like lawn and garden or maybe a DIY demand that wouldn\u2019t have otherwise occurred?\nCraig Menear: Well, first of all, just to clarify, I didn\u2019t say 200 basis points of comp, I would say it\u2019s several hundred basis points of comp. You sort of have to think about it as a gross impact. There is no doubt that when we took steps to move our operating hours to close at 6:00 PM, really in advance of a lot of the shelter-in-place orders out there, we knew it would have a significant impact on sales. It did, but if you \u2013 and then if you think about customer account limits, you had a similar impact. It\u2019s very hard though to dissect what offsets were to that. I would just tell you that we know the gross impact would have been in the several hundred basis points of comp.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And then, at the gross margin line, could you walk through the moving parts in a little more detail around the lower impact of fewer promotional events as well as the mix shift to online sales, and to what extent that had a negative impact that you think could fade as consumers go back into your stores?\nCraig Menear: With respect to mix, it was \u2013 it was really more about product mix. You think about growth in certain categories like appliances and lumber that had a mix impact. Beyond that, we run this business as a portfolio. And if you think about interconnected sales, over 60% of the sales ordered on homedepot.com were picked up in our stores. And so, that margin profile is, in essence, we have one company margin profile. We \u2013 our goal is to ensure that our customers can order product the way they like and to fulfill it in the way they\u2019re choosing. So, we \u2013 aside from those few categories, let\u2019s say, that was the most significant impact in the quarter.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Baker: Hi. Thanks. First question, and then I\u2019ll have a followup. But what are you seeing in some of the states that are starting to loosen some of their restrictions now? I understand that you\u2019ve been open in all states, but some of the areas like your hometown, are you seeing anything significant over the last couple of weeks as they start to open up?\nCraig Menear: Yes. I mean, we see \u2013 again, as we\u2019ve shared, our early second quarter sales are strong, and we see that across geographies.\nMike Baker: So, can I interpret from that that you\u2019re not seeing anything different in states that are starting to open?\nCraig Menear: I mean, everything is lifting. And as you can imagine, where you still have hotspots, there is still pressure. But everywhere else, it\u2019s lifting.\nMike Baker: Okay, understood. And if I could ask one more follow-up, just a bit more color in some categories. I don\u2019t \u2013 unless I missed it, I don\u2019t think I did, but usually give a little bit more detail on some categories. Lawn and garden and paints \u2013 DIY paint \u2013 are two that I was particularly interested in. And if you think are presumably they were strong, I guess I\u2019ll let you tell me that, but if so, do you think there was a pull forward or does that sort of fade over time? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: No. We actually didn\u2019t call that out, because it\u2019s kind of not relevant. When you look at the changes in the three segments of business, there is wild swings like I shared both month-to-month, week-to-week, category-to-category, so we just \u2013 we didn\u2019t call that out.\nMike Baker: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate the color.\nIsabel Janci: And Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. Richard, I had a follow-up. Thanks for the breakdown of the $850 million, and you mentioned digital margins are part of the company. Is it fair to say that even on the dot-com, the part that is in focus, that you make money on digital? And then, the second question is really for Craig. Given on the sort of period of volatility in your balance sheet, etc, how are you thinking about incremental investments whether they be at the company or M&A or strategic, given what\u2019s going on out there and the opportunities that might arise? Thanks.\nRichard McPhail: On the margin question, we don\u2019t split that out, but I can tell you, we\u2019re very happy with our business across the portfolio.\nCraig Menear: And as it relates to investment, starting with our strategic investment, we feel like we\u2019re investing in the right places for sure. We\u2019re going to continue to evaluate as we learnt in this and see if there is any modifications or tweaks that need to happen in terms of our approach, but we feel like we are in the right places. Clearly we postponed some of the things that impact the stores because we don\u2019t want to create more disruption in the stores right now. And we\u2019ll bring them back when it\u2019s appropriate to be able to do that in our stores. I mean, as far as our approach to anything else beyond that, we have shared all along that our M&A approach is around capabilities that would be our continuing thought process and approach. I candidly can\u2019t imagine anybody doing an M&A in this environment right now, because I\u2019m not sure how a Board would ever value what you\u2019re paying for something, but that\u2019s our approach. I mean, our thought process has stayed the same that we would always look for capabilities.\nGreg Melich: That\u2019s great. Good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nGreg Melich: Great job.\nIsabel Janci: So thank you for joining \u2013 sorry, Christine, go ahead.\nOperator: I was going to just turn the floor back over to you, Ms. Janci, for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: So thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in August.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call. Following today's comments about our performance, we will take a few minutes to update you on our strategic priorities as we look towards the next phase of growth. We will hold all questions until the end of our prepared remarks. After that, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department. In addition, as referenced in our quarterly earnings release, after the call, we will post a few supplemental slides to the Investor Relations website. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear, Chairman and CEO; Ted Decker, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call this morning. As you know, this is my last earnings call, and it has been a blessing and an honor to serve our customers, associates, shareholders and communities for the last 7.5 years as CEO. I'm extremely proud of the progress this team has made together, but perhaps our greatest accomplishment has been nurturing the culture of our company, which I believe is a competitive advantage. I am confident that this leadership team will effectively guide The Home Depot through its next phase of growth. But before we talk about that, let's first discuss our results for the year. Fiscal 2021 was another record year for The Home Depot as we achieved the milestone of over $150 billion in sales. We have continued to navigate a challenging and fluid environment with agility. This resulted in double-digit comp growth for fiscal 2021 on top of nearly 20% comp growth that we delivered in fiscal 2020. We've grown the business by over $40 billion over the last two years. For context, prior to the pandemic, it took us nine years from 2009 to 2018 to grow the business by over $40 billion. So to achieve that level of growth in two years' time is truly a testament to our investments, our teams and their exceptional execution. None of what has been accomplished over the past two years would have been possible without our orange-blooded associates. Our associates have maintained their relentless focus on the customer while simultaneously navigating the ongoing pandemic, industry-wide supply chain disruptions, inflation and a tight labor market. The tenure and strength of our relationships with our supplier and transportation partners has also been key to our success. Our respective teams have worked tirelessly to build depth in key product categories and flow product to stores and distribution centers as quickly and efficiently as possible. I could not be more proud of the resilience and strength that our associates have continued to demonstrate, and I want to thank them and all of our partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers, communities and each other. Their extraordinary efforts in fiscal 2021 resulted in record Success Sharing, our bonus program for our hourly associates. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ted, who will provide some additional details on our fourth quarter performance.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with another exceptional quarter as home improvement demand remained strong. Sales for the fourth quarter grew approximately $3.5 billion to $35.7 billion, up 10.7% from last year. Comp sales were up 8.1% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 7.6%. During the fourth quarter, all our regions and merchandise departments posted positive comps. Departments of comps above the company average were plumbing, electrical, building materials, millwork, decor and storage and paint. Our kitchen bath department was in line with the company average. And hardware tools, lumber, flooring, appliances and our garden departments were positive but below the company average. During the fourth quarter, our comp average ticket increased 12.3%. Comp transactions decreased 3.8%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by inflation across several product categories. Core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 185 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by inflation in lumber, building materials and copper. Lumber prices remain volatile. For example, in the fourth quarter alone, the pricing for framing lumber ranged from approximately $585 to over $1,200 per 1,000 board feet, an increase of more than 100%. On a two-year basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive in the fourth quarter. Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 18% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We saw continued strength in both our Pro and DIY customers. During the fourth quarter, Pro sales growth outpaced DIY growth. Sales growth for both our Pro and DIY customers accelerated in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and showed strong double-digit growth on a two-year basis for both customer groups. Sales leveraging our digital platforms grew approximately 6% for the fourth quarter and approximately 9% for the year. Over the past two years, sales from our digital platforms have grown over 100%. Our focus on delivering a frictionless, interconnected shopping experience is resonating with our customers as approximately 50% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores in fiscal 2021. We feel great about our position as the #1 retailer for home improvement, and we look forward to serving our customers in the busy spring selling season. Before I hand the call over to Richard, I also want to say a huge thank you to all our associates as well as our supplier and transportation partners for their incredible effort in 2021. Over the last year, we faced a number of challenges, including rising cost pressures, disruptions throughout the supply chain and the ongoing pandemic. We're extremely grateful for the way our cross-functional teams work with our partners to mitigate these challenges while staying focused on serving our customers and communities. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, total sales were $35.7 billion, an increase of approximately $3.5 billion or 10% -- 10.7% from last year. Our total company comps were positive 8.1% for the quarter, with positive comps of 7.3% in November, 10.2% in December and 7% in January. Comps in the U.S. were positive 7.6% for the quarter, with positive comps of 7.2% in November, 10.9% in December and 5.4% in January. Our results in the fourth quarter were once again driven by broad-based strength across the business and our geographies. All 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps, and Canada and Mexico, both posted double-digit positive comps in the fourth quarter. For the year, our sales totaled a record $151.2 billion, with sales growth of $19 billion or 14.4% versus fiscal 2020. For the year, total company comp sales increased 11.4%, and U.S. comp sales increased 10.7%. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.2%, a decrease of approximately 35 basis points from last year. And for the year, our gross margin was 33.6%, a decrease of approximately 30 basis points from last year, primarily driven by product mix and investments in our supply chain network. During the fourth quarter, operating expenses were approximately 19.7% of sales, representing a decrease of approximately 120 basis points from last year. Our operating leverage during the fourth quarter reflects comparisons against significant COVID-related expenses that we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 to support our associates, the anniversarying of $110 million of non-recurring expenses related to the completion of the HD Supply acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2020, and solid expense management for the quarter. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we also incurred approximately $125 million of COVID-related expenses. For the year, operating expenses were approximately 18.4% of sales, representing a decrease of approximately 170 basis points from fiscal 2020. Our operating expense leverage in fiscal 2021 reflects a decrease in our COVID-related costs compared to last year, partially offset by wage actions taken at the end of 2020 as well as throughout 2021. Our operating expenses for the year included a consistent level of investment in our business, which we intend to continue. For the year, we are very pleased with the operating expense leverage we were able to deliver. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 13.5% and for the year was approximately 15.2%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter was essentially flat with last year. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 25.5% and for fiscal 2021 was 24.4%. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $3.21, an increase of 21.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021 were $15.53, an increase of 30.1% compared to fiscal 2020. During the year, we opened 7 new stores and added 14 new stores through a small acquisition, bringing our store count to 2,317 at the end of fiscal 2021. Retail selling square footage was approximately 241 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2021. Total sales per retail square foot were approximately $605 in fiscal 2021, the highest in our company's history. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $22.1 billion, an increase of $5.4 billion versus last year. And inventory turns were 5.2x, down from 5.8x from the same period last year. Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we invested approximately $830 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. This brings total capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 to $2.6 billion. During the year, we paid approximately $7 billion of dividends to our shareholders. We look to grow our dividend every year as we grow earnings. And today, we announced our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 15% to $1.90 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $7.60. And finally, during fiscal 2021, we returned approximately $15 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases, including $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 44.7%, up from 40.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Now I'll comment on our outlook for 2022. The broader housing environment continues to be supportive of home improvement. Demand for homes continues to be strong, and existing home inventory available for sale remains near record lows, resulting in support for continued home price appreciation. On average, homeowners' balance sheets continue to strengthen as the aggregate value of U.S. home equity grew approximately 35% or $6.5 trillion since the first quarter of 2019. The housing stock continues to age, and customers tell us the demand for home improvement projects of all sizes is healthy. While we are encouraged by the consistent and resilient demand we've seen for home improvement, broader uncertainty remains with respect to the impact of inflation, supply chain dynamics and how consumer spending will evolve through the year. Given these factors establishing full year 2022 guidance based on macroeconomic fundamentals remains challenging. As a result, our fiscal 2022 guidance is based on the run rate of dollar demand we have observed over the last 2 quarters. We adjust this dollar run rate for our historical seasonality to calculate our sales outlook for 2022.  Based on this approach and assuming there are no material shifts in demand, we calculate that sales growth and comp sales growth will be slightly positive for fiscal 2022. We expect our 2022 operating margin to be flat to 2021. And we would expect low single-digit percentage growth in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2021. Over the course of fiscal 2022, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our annual expectation of approximately 2% of sales going forward. We believe that we have positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment as evidenced by our results. The investments we've made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model. As we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen our position with our customers, leverage our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market and deliver shareholder value. With that, I'll hand it back to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Richard. And again, let me congratulate the team on an exceptional year. In a few moments, Ted and Richard will share their thoughts on the next phase of growth for our company. The leadership team has spent a lot of time over the past year talking about what's next for The Home Depot, and I have never been more excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us. While change is constant in our business, our strategic priorities remain consistent: deliver the best customer experience in home improvement and extend our low-cost provider position. Our objectives to grow market share and deliver exceptional shareholder value are also unchanged. And as Ted will detail, the investments we have made and will continue to make in differentiated capabilities throughout the business will unlock the opportunity to deliver a value proposition that we believe is unique in our industry. We are well positioned to leverage our distinct competitive advantages to capitalize on a compelling growth opportunity in our space. We have a world-class leadership team who have the vision and experience to guide our company to new heights. We have a team of approximately 500,000 associates who are committed to the culture that our founders instilled in our business over 40 years ago. These associates have demonstrated exceptional execution and an unwavering commitment to our customers regardless of the operating environment. I believe that the greatest days for The Home Depot are ahead of us. And it is my honor to turn the call over to Ted, who will share a bit more about our strategic priorities for 2022 and beyond.\nTed Decker: Thank you, Craig. Let me take a moment to express my sincere appreciation for all that you have done for this company throughout your 25-year career. You're a tremendous steward of our culture, ensuring our values guide every decision we make as a leadership team. You led us through a transformational period and positioned us well for the future. So on behalf of all our associates, thank you. I believe that Home Depot is an organization unlike any other. Our success is driven by our orange-blooded associates, unique culture, customer focus and operational excellence. This is the power of The Home Depot and why we are the #1 retailer for home improvement. I'd like to spend some time talking about the future, what's next for this great company. We've seen several inflection points in our company's history, all spurred by a desire to maintain the growth mentality and entrepreneurial spirit created by Bernie and Arthur when they revolutionized the home improvement industry over 40 years ago. Over the years, we have used these inflection points to adapt to changing market conditions and customer expectations. Approximately 15 years ago, we pivoted from new stores as a driver of growth to growth driven by productivity. Years later, we began building capabilities to better enable a multichannel shopping experience through an end-to-end approach. In recent years, we focused on a customer-back approach to deliver the best interconnected shopping experience in home improvement. Customer expectations continue to evolve, and there is little tolerance for any friction in the shopping journey. So we will continue to adapt to stay ahead of the customer. We have seen a tremendous amount of growth in the past decade. We could have never predicted the more than $40 billion in growth since the end of 2019. With this growth, we are reimagining new milestones for the business. I'm going to turn it over to Richard, who will briefly talk through our goals and help frame the opportunity within the context of our total addressable market.\nRichard McPhail: Thanks, Ted. Our objectives to grow market share and deliver exceptional shareholder value are unchanged. Aligned with these objectives, our goals are: first, to grow the business to $200 billion in sales, which represents incremental growth of approximately $50 billion from where we are today; and second, and just as importantly, deliver best-in-class operating profit dollar growth and return on invested capital. We believe that we will achieve these goals through what we are confident is the winning formula for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. We intend to provide the best experience in home improvement, extend our position as the low-cost provider and be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. Over the last 2 years, as we've grown by over $40 billion in sales, our addressable market has also grown. We now estimate that our total addressable market in North America is greater than $900 billion. We have invested in capabilities that improve our competitive positioning and allow us to pursue opportunities we could not meaningfully address in the past, which provides significant growth opportunities with both consumers and Pros. We estimate that each of these respective customer groups represent about 50% of the total addressable market. We also estimate that each of these important customer groups represent approximately 50% of our total sales. For Pro, we believe this addressable end market is over $450 billion. Within this end market, we believe our addressable maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO space, has expanded to over $100 billion. So while we are the #1 home improvement retailer across all of our geographies, we represent a relatively small part of a large and fragmented total addressable market that has expanded significantly over the past 2 years. To support our growth objectives, we have a straightforward approach to capital allocation that will also remain unchanged. Investing in the business is our primary capital allocation priority, and we have learned that it is critical to invest in a more consistent and agile way. Our investment cadence has become more real time, allowing us to pivot more quickly, giving us the ability to move faster when we see positive results. After investing in the business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and making share repurchases. While there is more to do as we fine-tune new go-to-market strategies and refine our processes to better serve our customers, we believe what we are creating will extend our leadership position. We intend to leverage our unmatched scale as we continue to optimize assets and capabilities to compete in a more disruptive way. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, the opportunity in front of us is compelling, and our capital allocation principles will continue to create value for our stakeholders.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Richard. We have a powerful foundation and distinct competitive advantages. First, as I mentioned earlier, our unique culture and values as well as our knowledgeable associates will remain a competitive differentiator. Second, our stores are the hub of our business and will always be important in the future of home improvement retail. We have a premier real estate footprint that provides convenience for the customer. Third, we believe we have the most relevant brands and products and are continuously driving innovation in the marketplace. Fourth, we have a best-in-class supply chain and have demonstrated our ability to operate with agility and navigate any environment. And finally, we have consistently improved the interconnected shopping experience as our customers increasingly blend physical and digital worlds for their projects. We continue to invest and strengthen these advantages to ensure the best experience for our customers. While there is more work to do, we've made important strides in removing friction from the customer experience. Let me give you real examples of how the investments we've made across the business are earning us more share of wallet with our customers. Let's take the example of one of our Pro customers in the Dallas market. Years ago, this large-scale repair/remodeler primarily shop with us in our stores for their unplanned immediate need purchases, largely out of convenience. Over time, their in-store spend increased and they were signed a dedicated Pro Account Representative, or PAR, to deepen our relationship with them. As we invested across the interconnected experience, this customer engaged with us more often and occasionally used us for job site delivery. At this point, we saw their spend with The Home Depot grow to more than $100,000 annually but still for mostly unplanned immediate need purchases in store. Fast forward to today, this customer now utilize the number of new and/or improved capabilities. Last year, this customer downloaded our mobile app. Their mobile orders increased. They joined our Pro loyalty program and authenticated with us via our B2B website. We began offering personalized pricing on certain products. And they took their first deliveries from several of our new fulfillment centers, including one of our new flatbed distribution centres. As a result, we\u2019ve seen spend with this customer more than triple to over $300,000 annually. While this is one example, we see that customers increase spend with us as they build confidence in our capabilities. While we continue serving this customer for their unplanned immediate-need purchases, we now believe our capabilities are beginning to satisfy important planned purchase occasions. We believe the ability to serve our Pros' planned and unplanned purchase occasions will be an important driver of growth as we work towards a $200 billion sales milestone. And while Pro is an important driver of growth going forward, removing friction from the DIY customer is equally important. Let's take the example of a customer we'll call Geena, a DIY customer tackling a bathroom remodel 4 years ago and compare that with the same shopping experience today. 4 years ago, she would have relied heavily on our stores and website for helping completing her project. Geena's engagement on our digital applications is a little more difficult. The mobile experience wasn't as intuitive, search results weren't as relevant, and associated recommendations were limited.  As a result, she likely made multiple trips to the store for items didn\u2019t know she needed. And when she did go to the store, buy online pick up in store, or BOPUS, was essentially the only option outside of the traditional cash-and-carry model for collecting whatever tools and materials her project required. Today, Geena's experience would be meaningfully different as her shopping journey is met with a lot less friction. As Geena begins her project online, improvements in search provide her with more relevant results. We also have a better understanding of the intent of her shopping journey and can make recommendations supporting her whole project. And we know these product relevant recommendations matter. Over the last 4 years, we've seen a significant increase in sales driven by product recommendations. When Geena comes to our stores, our recently updated mobile app and improved signage help her more easily navigate our aisles. We've made investments in the front end to improve her checkout experience.  And as always, our knowledgeable associates are there to help Geena throughout her project. If Geena chooses to place an order online for pickup in the store, she has multiple fulfillment options. She can pick up her items at the service desk, grab those items from a locker or have them brought to her car with curbside pickup. Geena can also receive same- or next-day delivery on thousands of items. We have seen customers like Geena increase their spend with The Home Depot as a result of our improved in-store experience, more robust and personalized online shopping journey and greater delivery and fulfillment options. We are also shifting our mindset to deliver a truly seamless interconnected experience. The flywheel we are building goes beyond retail's traditional channel mindset to an ecosystem of capabilities and operational efficiencies working together to remove friction at every step of the customer shopping journey. For example, while we believe the supply chain network we are building is transformational, it's just not about the buildings themselves. The value lies in their connection to the overall fulfillment and store ecosystem in the improved customer experience. The new fulfillment centers enable us to expand our assortment and inventory depth as well as offer faster and more reliable delivery options. In addition, these new facilities removed some fulfillment pressures historically placed on stores, creating a better in-store shopping experience and freeing up associates to help drive additional sales. Our intention is to build an unrivaled delivery network for home improvement goods. While early days, we continue to develop our capabilities, and we are encouraged as we see a measurable lift in sales with a more interconnected shopping experience. As we move forward towards this next phase of growth, we will remain focused on driving productivity, a long-standing hallmark of The Home Depot. Enabled by technology, we are focused on eliminating unnecessary tasks and making our processes more efficient while also making our shopping experience the best in home improvement. When I think about our stores, I think about the tremendous amount of productivity over the years, all of which helped us achieve over $600 in sales per retail square foot in 2021. As we set our sights on our goal of $200 billion in sales, we have many opportunities to improve freight flow throughout the store and drive further space optimization in SKU productivity. The productivity initiatives don't reside solely in our stores, we see many opportunities across the business. When our founders started The Home Depot over 40 years ago, they transformed an industry. We are continuing that legacy but doing so in an interconnected way. We believe that the interconnected ecosystem we are building will increase our ability to capture share. We intend to disrupt traditional business models with new go-to-market strategies. The opportunity in front of us is exciting today as it was when we first opened our doors, and I am honored to help lead this company into the next phase of growth. Thank you for your interest in The Home Depot. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone, and Craig and Ted, congratulations on the transition. My first question is \u2013 you\u2019re welcome. And the first question is on the outlook for sales. So if you're guiding to slightly positive comps and we were to assume if this is the right assumption that the level of inflation that you mentioned around 2%, just around it, that means units are roughly flat for the year. Can you tell us what you're seeing that would suggest that volumes are flat? I heard Richard's comment around the on-the-run in the last two quarters of business, but is there any housing component or interest rate increases? And do you think this ends up being a more conservative approach to your guidance then as opposed to anchoring into some type of housing or interest rate metric?\nTed Decker : Simeon, on the comment around inflation, let me clarify how we approach that. The -- what we've seen in the marketplace that's embedded in our business over the last two quarters is kind of our assumption going forward. We're neutral. And as we establish a point, put together our outlook, we don't plan on inflation or deflation from that point forward. We just deal with whatever comes our way. So there is no inflation built in, if you will. It's what's there in the business today and then we'll deal with what comes at us in '22.\nCraig Menear: I think just to go back to your macro questions and then we can talk about unit. On the macro side, as we said, look, there are a lot of dynamics in the environment right now. And so it's difficult to rest guidance on any given set of macroeconomic assumptions. That's actually why, when we look at the last two quarters of 2021, we saw a level of stability and consistency that gave us some confidence in being able to extrapolate those numbers on to '22. So it's really more of a math exercise based on current demand patterns than it is macroeconomics. Now we know the housing environment is supportive of home improvement demand. And Ted maybe can give some color on unit in that context.\nTed Decker : Yes. So transactions in units have been negative coming off that incredible year in 2020, but they have improved on a two-year basis over what we saw in Q2 and Q3. And what we're really seeing on the demand side and as we think of transactions in units is it's not dissimilar to a storm environment, Simeon. It's a matter of -- particularly in Pro-oriented categories. When we receive the goods and get them on our shelves, they go. While we're seeing a lot of substitution, we still think there's plenty of upside as the supply chain continues to restock our shelves.\nSimeon Gutman : Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up is the best-in-class operating profit dollar growth. Not trying to get cute to the letter of a number, but who is it? Is it sector-relative retail? And is there anything about the end markets that you mentioned, the Pro or MRO, that's actually margin-dilutive?\nRichard McPhail: No. It's -- I'd say we think of it in terms of our sector, our $900 billion-plus addressable market. And I'd say we have opportunities that have many different profiles, but I\u2019ll share one thing, which is the ability to deliver exceptional return on capital. And so that's what we're looking to push.\nCraig Menear: And Simeon, when you look at our business historically, we have Pros that shop across the store. Our Pro business, for example, in and of itself is a relatively common margin profile to our DIY business. Certainly, within specific trades, you have variation like masons versus painters. But in total, it's very similar.\nSimeon Gutman : Thank you. Good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Craig and Ted, congrats.\nTed Decker : Thanks.\nMichael Lasser : A little embarrassing, but you forgot to include the year that you expect to get to $200 billion. So if you could just get into that real quick, that would be great.\nRichard McPhail : So \u2013 good morning, Michael. We've established a goal of $200 billion in sales. We intend to get there as soon as we can in a sustainable and profitable way.\nMichael Lasser : Would you expect the growth rate to be higher, moving towards, in the 3.5% to 4% that you had signaled last time you provided a formal long-term outlook?\nRichard McPhail : There are a lot of dynamics in our market right now, but what we are confident in is our ability to take share in any environment. And we intend to grow market share every -- in every period.\nTed Decker : So Michael, as we think about this $200 billion, it's clearly the next phase of growth. It's a goal for the team and investors, obviously, that having passed $150 billion that we set our sights on $200 billion. And without getting into the specific growth components, the way we think about it is we operate in a huge market, as Richard described, a market that we think is larger at $900-odd billion. That market is very healthy and growing. And obviously, we have a level of base growth that would track with that market. We've also demonstrated over time that we've been able to take share, and we believe we'll continue to take share in that market. And then perhaps most importantly, as we've chatted about in our prepared remarks, we're working on developing the best interconnected experience in retail. So if you take the artifact of Geena, as we build this seamless, interconnected shopping experience, we think we'll gain even more share with our consumer and Pro customers. What we're building is relevant for both consumers and Pros. But specific to Pros, when you think about the example of the Pro in Dallas, we're building capabilities with our Pro ecosystem to accelerate Pro share growth, particularly in planned purchases. We've always talked about every Pro is in our building. We're sort of the 7-Eleven for Pros, convenience, value, tremendous product and brands. But what we're building now is something completely different and revolutionary to get the Pro planned purchase. Add to that the expanded MRO space, now we think $100 billion with the acquisition of HD Supply, and then wrap that all with our hallmark of productivity, we know that we leave money on the table every time we have a shelf out. We've talked to you about all the productivity activities in the store: overhead maintenance, freight flow, on-shelf availability, the supply chain that John and team are building to increase our on-shelf availability, their share gain just by being better in stock, and we're certainly seeing that in this storm-esque environment we're operating in right now. So that's sort of a broad-brush framework of how we think about that next $50 billion of growth.\nMichael Lasser : Understood. And my follow-up question is on the outlook for this year. How do you frame the upside/downside for this year with respect to your operating margin? If your sales are down, call it, low single digits, can you still have a flat operating margin in that scenario? And if your sales are up low single digits, would you let that flow through to the bottom line since your operating margin would be up? Or would you look to reinvest that back in the business?\nRichard McPhail : Well, thank you, Michael. First, we're clear on our focus, which is to drive operating profit dollar growth. We do maintain a degree of financial flexibility in our model, and so we are able to make adjustments as we see fit. I think it's important to say that in an environment as dynamic as this, we would have to understand the circumstances to make a decision around what we -- what management action we might take. But we do have that degree of financial flexibility in the model. We have a history of delivering operating expense leverage as volume grows, and we intend to do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChris Horver: Congratulations to everybody on their retirement and, Ted, on your new job. Really exciting. Can you talk a little bit about this inflation commentary? Some of your vendors have announced further price increases coming in the new year. They're sort of assuming units roughly flat. Are you taking those price increases? And have you seen actual any elasticity issues as you've passed those through to the consumer?\nTed Decker : Yes, Chris, it's Ted, and thanks for your comment. Clearly, with double-digit AUR, we are taking cost. I would say that AUR increase is about 2/3 price, which includes the 185 basis points of commodity we called out, and about 1/3 mix in new. If I can just hit on that for a moment. We continue to see tremendous innovation with the products and the customers' willingness to trade up to that more innovative product. So that continues to drive about 1/3. And if you may recall, last quarter, it was more 50-50. So the inflation component increased to 2/3 this past quarter. I would say our merchants deal with this every day. Jeff and team are obviously in constant discussions with our suppliers working on the end-to-end cost and the value chain. And when we take cost, we're working to be the customers' advocate for value. We think being a scale player, that matters. And again, that end-to-end value equation, we should be able to offer the best value in any environment, including this inflationary environment. But as Craig said, we're not forecasting any further inflation, same way we don't forecast commodity inflation. We just start the year where we end the year, and we assume neutrality. We're doing the same for inflation in goods. Well, we're priced in cost and priced where we are as we end the year, and we don't have any incremental inflation in our plan.\nChris Horvers : And you haven't seen the consumer trade down, and substitution has been very high.\nTed Decker : So -- yes. So on your elasticity question, for sure, every product -- and it's different by product categories, but every category has its elasticity curve, which the merchants watch very carefully. As we called out in Q2 with lumber, for example, when lumber hit those extraordinary highs in the early part of last year, we saw a dramatic unit productivity falloff, and then we also saw a very quick falloff in lumber prices. As lumber prices have recovered through this quarter, we are starting to see some unit pressure on lumber. But again, I'd say a lot of it is supply-related as well. I mean we could -- it's tougher to get that elasticity curve completely right when we have the supply imbalances. But for sure, there's elasticity curve, Chris, for every product category. We're not kidding ourselves about that, but we're managing it appropriately. And our merchants are all about driving unit volume. That's the way we're wired. And we will always price per unit volume over rate.\nChris Horvers : Got it. And then my follow-up question is, just think about the fourth quarter gross margin and the outlook into next year, was there anything unique in the fourth quarter on gross margin? And given that you're pulling a lot of costs up in the supply chain as you build out the fulfillment, I would think that, that would mean continued pressure on gross margin and the opportunity comes in on the operating expense line.\nRichard McPhail : Right, Chris. So for Q4 this year, it was really a story of sort of rebate timing year-over-year. There was pressure from the build-out of One Supply Chain as we've had every quarter for a few years. That -- the pressure on gross margin, as we continue building One Supply Chain out in 2022, will continue. And so that's sort of the way we're thinking about freight.\nTed Decker : And I'd also say, Chris, that our merchants don't necessarily differentiate the transportation cost, where most of the pressure in supply chain is coming in from an initial cost of a good. They're both costs that need to be covered in the portfolio, which I think we did effectively throughout 2021.\nRichard McPhail : As a whole, 2021 was a mix of products sold and a slight pressure from investment in One Supply Chain's story.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom : Congrats on a great year. I was curious on Pro backlog levels. If you could just give us an update on that front. And then also was curious if you're seeing any noticeable changes in spending patterns by income cohorts in light of some of these inflationary pressures and the end of stimulus in January?\nCraig Menear : Everything we hear from our Pro customers is they've got more work than they can handle. I know for myself, it took a while to get somebody out to just do simple projects around my house. We hear that all over the country. And so the Pro business backlog is healthy.\nRichard McPhail : And it's really sort of across the business. When you take that elasticity comment to a more macro level, as Ted said, this is a storm-like environment. And when you look at external third-party surveys of remodelers, the index numbers have never been higher. So all of that points to healthy conditions.\nCraig Menear : Wouldn't say, to your question, that we've seen changes. We haven't seen any dramatic shifts in customer patterns. And again, it's a little hard right now because as Ted said, this is almost like a storm environment. I mean you get the product, it goes. And so pretty hard to see any patterns that have changed much.\nChuck Grom : Okay. That's helpful. And then bigger picture, I was wondering if you guys just dig a little bit deeper in terms of the space optimization and SKU productivity efforts. Just maybe just a little bit more color on where in the store you think you can gain improvement off that $600 in sales per square foot.\nTed Decker : Well, we mentioned last quarter in our prepared remarks are -- what we call get stores right, GSR initiative, where we tested over more than a year. And this is largely about macro space allocation and getting the facings and the inventory depth to drive the volume that we do. As you say, that's $600 a square foot. And we continue to be thrilled with that initiative. We did several hundred stores last year, and that will be our largest store investment that will continue in 2022. And we'll do hundreds of more stores this year. Jeff, maybe you can give some color of what you're seeing.\nJeff Kinnaird : Yes. Thank you, Ted. GSR is working exceptionally well for us. It's addressing the sales per square foot opportunity we have in our highest-volume stores. Not to mention, we're gaining a tremendous amount of learning that we're taking back to all stores in terms of addressing every 8-foot bay, for lack of a better term, and we're improving space productivity. So an enormous opportunity on GSR. And then alongside that, we do manage a very long-standing product line review process, where we continue to look at hundreds of programs every year, again, to drive more productivity inside of our stores.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.\nScot Ciccarelli : I was hoping you might be able to provide a little bit more color regarding the increase in TAM that you just discussed. I think it's a pretty big increase from the last time. And I guess what I'm wondering is, how much of that is just expansion of existing markets where Home Depot was already highly competitive. Versus how much is, let's call it, a sizable component from newer market penetration with kind of stuff like MRO as kind of newer market, if you will?\nRichard McPhail : Sure, Scot. So in maybe a different order than you asked. So first of all, base growth in the market in which we've always competed has been exceptional over the last 2 years. And so if you look at the U.S., if you look at Canada, if you look at Mexico, those markets have expanded. And you can see that if you triangulate it -- and measuring this market is kind of an art in triangulation. We're looking at census data. We're looking at third-party consulting data. We're asking our vendors. We have a high degree of confidence we have a really good perspective on it. And we triangulate all that and you just look at the numbers that, again, exist in those third-party data sets, you see exceptional growth. It's notable to add that for the first time, we are including our Canadian and Mexican businesses within our definition. So $900 billion plus is a definition of our North American addressable market. We don't really include -- you mentioned new market opportunities. There aren't really new market opportunities per se, with the exception of MRO, which with the acquisition of HD Supply, we became even better positioned to grow share in. And as we've gotten smarter about that business, as we've gotten smarter about understanding the opportunities of it, that led us to sort of resize the opportunity.  So those are the building blocks. But the growth over the past 2 years has been impressive. The macro backdrop for continued growth is also really encouraging.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson.\nMichael Baker: I'll ask a few sort of shorter-term-type questions. But one, in the past, you've given some color on current quarter trends to date. I think that's maybe particularly important now as we cycle up against the stimulus from a year ago. And then -- sorry, 1 question in 2 parts. Within your guidance for 2022, what are you including for share buybacks? I don't think you said that, unless I missed it.\nRichard McPhail : Thank you. Well, we are off to a strong start as the year begins. It is 2 weeks into a 13-week quarter, and we've got the more difficult compares of the year coming up in March and April. So it's early to draw any conclusions there. And obviously, timing of spring is important for the first half of the year, but we're off to a strong start. With respect to share repurchases -- sorry, Ted, would you -- and with respect to share  repurchases, we intend to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we'll do that again this year. We have $9.5 billion remaining in our current share authorization program.\nMichael Baker: So I guess a follow-up on that, is it fair -- I mean you must have a number in the EPS plan. In the past, you've provided that. Is it fair to say that, that includes the full buyback relative to your authorization?\nRichard McPhail : We like to maintain some degree of flexibility in the cash that we hold on the balance sheet and our liquidity position. But you can rest assured that it's our intent to return excess cash to shareholders.\nMichael Baker: Yes. Okay. Understood. One more, if I could ask a follow-up. I don't know if that counts as my follow-up, but -- and maybe this is too long of a question for -- getting close to an hour here. But when you talk about competing in a more disruptive way, I think sometimes we think of that as -- is that more than just price? That's not -- are you signaling anything in terms of a change in your pricing strategy? Or is it bigger than that?\nTed Decker : No. It's a capability comment. We're not changing our promotional or pricing approach at all. The disruption is in the ecosystem we are building. We are -- have been, 42 years, the #1 home improvement retailer. We are built -- have been building and will continue to build frictionless, interconnected experiences that we think are disruptive in the essence of the frictionless nature of them as our customers weave in between the physical and digital worlds. That can be installation, that can be delivery, that can be pickup, that can be cash and carry. As we build that frictionless ecosystem, we think that in of itself is disruptive because our aim is to build the next level of frictionless experience. And then perhaps more disruptive is our pursuit of the Pro planned purchase. As we've said, all Pros are in our buildings. We always use the term that Pros use us as a 7-Eleven. Certainly, we have more share of wallet with smaller Pros. But the opportunity with larger Pros, to build their confidence that The Home Depot is going to be there for them with a sales representative, appropriate pricing, reliable delivery, breadth and depth of inventory, that is the real disruption.  And if I can just expand on that for a minute. When we think about what we're seeing in the Pro planned purchase, I mentioned this, I believe last quarter, that we're seeing a redefinition of what we thought was a job lot quantity. We've always talked about being a project store, having job lots in the store. And I think I used an example of a foreign job, that we might have had 3-odd jobs worth of flooring in the store. So an average job might be 1,000 square feet. So we'd have 3,000 square feet in the store at any one time to satisfy 3 jobs. What we're seeing going out of the flatbed distribution centers, orders of 7,000 square feet, completely redefining what a job lot quantity is. Recently, in millwork, if you think of interior doors, we have different widths, right- and left-hand swing. We might have 20 doors in stock of any particular SKU. Just this week, we are delivering door orders of counts of 150 doors out of our FDCs. This is completely redefining our fulfillment capability with the Pro for their planned purchase. So that's what we mean by disruptive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi.\nSteven Zaccone : Craig, best wishes for the next step in your career. Ted, congrats on the new role.\nCraig Menear : Thank you.\nSteven Zaccone : I had a question on the operating margin outlook for the business. I understand the focus is on operating dollar growth, but gross margin has been somewhat of a hindrance to EBIT margin in the past 4 years. The business is roughly 120 basis points below the prior peak gross margin in the business. Do you think the business could get back to that level of gross margin over time? Or has something changed structurally?\nRichard McPhail : Nothing. Nothing has changed structurally. We have been and will continue to be the low-cost provider in our market. That provides us with plenty of opportunities to go after opportunities in a lot of ways. But let's just -- let's talk about operating margins. So first of all, we set a goal today of driving to $200 billion in sales. But we said just as importantly, we're going to deliver best-in-class operating profit dollar growth and ROIC. We're going to watch operating margin, but dollar growth and returns are our focus. So we can break the operating margin question down. Operating margin is a function of 2 things: it's a function of operating expense leverage and a function of gross margin dollar growth. So first, on operating expense leverage. Historically, we've delivered operating margin expansion, driven primarily by operating expense leverage. We expect this relationship to continue, and we're committed to levering expense with volume. Gross margin dollar growth will be a function of the opportunities we take to drive outsized share gains. And throughout our history, we've driven share gains in categories that deliver gross margin rate higher than our company average and lower than company average, but we've always created operating profit dollar growth and shareholder value creation that we're proud of. So appliances is a great example. And Ted, maybe you can -- you'd want to talk about that.\nTed Decker : Yes. I mean appliances was a business -- and we've been in it for some time, but it was a business initially we didn't want to be in because of what we thought was the low-margin profile. But what we realized is the gross margin dollars delivered with the type of volume of the business we've built, particularly since it's a virtual inventory in a sense, it's all special order. For sure, it's a much lower rate than our average, but the gross margin dollar return on investment is one of our highest. And the operating profit dollars that it delivered and the growth as we've built sort of a double-digit billion dollar appliance business is something we're thrilled we ultimately leaned into.\nRichard McPhail : And so if we have opportunities to take share and drive strong capital returns, we're going to continue to do that.\nSteven Zaccone : Great. That's very helpful context. A follow-up just on the external supply chain environment. Maybe just talk about the status of it right now. What's your expectation for the supply chain environment as we move through 2022? Do you see the situation improving at any point as we get through the year?\nJohn Deaton : Yes. This is John Deaton. We have seen some improvement, but we believe the constraints on the industry supply chain are likely to persist in the near term. Specifically, we've seen a little bit of easing of pressure at our ports, but we've planned for this and have been proactive in landing product earlier than usual to make sure that we're ready for the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGreg Scott : Again, Craig, thanks for all the help over the years. And Ted, congrats. The -- on inflation, I want to make sure I got this right. If ticket was up 12% in the fourth quarter, 2/3 of that was inflation, around 800 bps. Is that -- am I thinking about that the right way?\nTed Decker : Yes.\nGreg Scott : Got it. And so then as we think about the guidance for this year and when we talk about the level of inflation, it's basically -- we're starting at that kind of run rate. And presumably, it would come down over the course of the year and might be mid-single digits for the full year in your guidance.\nCraig Menear : We don't know where it goes. So presume the rate that was built in as we established that outlook based on our run rate. And we have no planned adjustment, up or down, in the guidance that we provided. So we plan -- in other words, think of inflation as neutral from the point in time that we established the guidance.\nGreg Scott : Okay. So from today, but that -- is that looking at it on the price of inventories? If the rate is up 800 bps year-on-year and the level stays the same, then presumably by the end of the year, if we just stay at these levels, we'll basically have 0 inflation by the fourth quarter. But in the first quarters, you could have positive.\nRichard McPhail : That's right. There is an anniversarying of AUR. That was taken in '21 that is reflected in 2020. That's correct, and your -- the way you're thinking about it is fair.\nGreg Scott : Got it. And so then maybe the transition would be if you think about -- maybe Richard, you could help us understand that -- as we think about the cadence through the year, not necessarily on top line, but even on costs and operating expenses, what unusual things are there? Or is 2021 a reasonable base now given all the COVID costs and wage actions that you took as we're thinking about modeling out this year?\nRichard McPhail : I would say 2021 still included COVID cost. I would tell you that we, after having grown $40 billion over 2 years, are really excited that we see growth beyond that base after 2 years of unprecedented growth. 2021 did include, particularly in the fourth quarter, a significant amount of COVID expense. Just the month of January alone was a real spike, and that has come down. We still do include some COVID expense in our 2022 outlook. And so we're not completely through what I would say could be, at least, hopefully, nonrecurring expenses going into the future. So there is a little bit of that in 2022.\nGreg Scott : Got it. And are there any wage actions? I mean we've seen rising labor costs and tightness there. How do you feel about getting people for the peak spring? And do you see any additional wage actions on the horizon?\nCraig Menear : Greg, I mean, we're out -- as we've indicated, we're looking to hire 100,000 people for the spring. We're going to utilize all of our capabilities and our messaging around attracting folks to The Home Depot. We've been able to do that. On the wage front, we're doing the same thing that we've always done. We look at this every single month. We look at market by market, and we're going to make sure that we're competitive in the marketplace so that we can attract folks into The Home Depot. Nothing's different there. There's certainly more action and more pressure than we've seen in the past, but our approach has not changed.\nTed Decker : Greg, I think the good news on the hiring 100,000 people are applications are up meaningfully. So we feel good about hiring that spring cohort.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird.\nPeter Benedict : Congrats, too, Craig, Ted.\nCraig Menear : Thank you.\nPeter Benedict : My question is on inventory. My first question is on inventory. As you sit here, it's up a little more than 50% over 2019 levels, sales up a little less than 40%. Just how are you thinking about that gap and what the right level of inventory is as we move through '22? I know your -- there was a comment earlier about landing product earlier. So just maybe talk us through the kind of the inventory situation, where you sit right now and how you see that flowing through the year.\nCraig Menear : Peter, a couple of comments. I mean, first of all, we feel good about the makeup of our inventory. As John said, we are working to bring goods in early to make sure that we're ready for spring. That's our busiest time of the year. I think an important thing to step back and look at is we delivered 5.2 turns. That turn level was higher than pre-pandemic levels, which ran 4.9. So we feel really good about the inventory productivity that we have in place. Last year's 5.8 was off of a scenario where we just didn't have a level of goods for a good portion of the year that we wanted to have. And then finally, as it relates to the inventory, as it's been referenced on the call here, we're in a -- still in many categories, we're in a storm-like environment. The more goods we get, the more we sell. And the merchants and the supply chain team have been working like crazy to continue to build inventory to find out what the high level of demand actually is. So we're kind of watching the productivity. At the same time, we're not concerned about the inventory build at $5 billion at all.\nPeter Benedict : Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess my next question is on to a category standpoint. Flooring was mentioned a little bit below, I guess, the company average. Just curious if there's anything going on within that category from like just an overall tone or what you're seeing. Or is that not really a material change?\nJeff Kinnaird : Peter, it's Jeff Kinnaird. We had a great quarter in flooring. We're happy with our business. The hard surface categories are exceptionally strong. If you look at vinyl flooring, electrified tile business, thrilled with the LifeProof private brand strategy we've got deployed. And on top of that, we just -- we're leveraging new capabilities that Ted spoke to with our supply chain and larger format tile. Very happy with the flooring business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim.\nSteve Forbes : Congrats all around. I wanted to focus on the 2021 expense build. So maybe to start with -- for Richard. Can you remind us how the Success Sharing program trended during 2021 relative to plan? And then as we think about incentive compensation for the whole year, is there anything to call out in terms of that weight right on the business as we look out to 2022?\nRichard McPhail : We're proud that we paid impressive levels of Success Sharing to our amazing associates. We do see that bonus normalizing in 2022. So that's part of the dynamic allowing us to keep operating margin flat in a slightly positive sales environment.\nSteve Forbes : And then just a follow-up, maybe thinking longer term, so for Ted or Richard. As we think about like the level of investment spending you're sort of indicating -- because it sounds like investment spending is going to be more constant. But any updated thoughts on how you sort of think about what the right level of spend is?  Or maybe you could just update us on your methodology on how you sort of approach your planning process for investment spending. Is it a certain percentage of sales that we should think about as the normal sort of base case level? Any sort of high-level thoughts on how we should be thinking about the model implications of investment-related spending?\nRichard McPhail : We do think that a steady and agile approach to capital investment in the business is the right one. We had what I would say is objectively an extraordinary return on investment in the period 2018 to 2020 when we ramped up our capital investment. But starting with last year, we established a sort of a guideline where we expect appropriate capital expenditures to be around 2% of sales. We intend to invest on a much more consistent basis but also a much more agile basis. And I think one benefit that we took from the period over the last 2 years is a much more frequent, almost evergreen constant reevaluation of where our investments were going and whether we were seeing returns. We pivoted significant investment within the capital plan and within the P&L during 2021, but that didn't mean it was incremental. We just saw where we had more favorable return on investment, and that's where we went. GSR is a great example of that over the last 2 years, an idea that our brilliant associates really kind of drove from grassroots and has become a major component of what we're doing from a productivity perspective. So that's the long answer. The short answer is we think 2% of sales should be adequate.\nCraig Menear : Yes, it's important to note that we do a reasonably robust testing scenario in most capital investments that we make. And we look to test and see a result before we actually roll. And that's a process that we've been using for the better part of the last 15 years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.\nKaren Short : A couple of questions just on, well, on the TAM and market share. So when you look at your share in 2019, I'm kind of at around 16% on the $650 billion TAM. And then when I look at '21, on a $900 billion TAM, you're kind of still at 16%. So I guess the first question is, why would your share not have increased? And maybe I'm not using apples-to-apples on the TAM, but maybe just clarify that.\nRichard McPhail : Well, I think it is such an imprecise science. We're trying to give you a sense that this is a huge market and it is fragmented. I think that trying to measure market share with precision difficult. That's why when we check ourselves in market share gain, we do a lot of triangulation, vendor partners, third-party data. And -- but as far as thinking about the $650 billion and the $900 billion, both of them had pluses attached to them. Again, it's not completely apples-to-apples. We've included the entirety of North America. We've expanded our view of MRO. Previously, our view of that market was $55 billion. As we understand that market is just a bigger market, we have a smaller share than we thought. And what I love about the $900 billion-plus number is there's a tremendous amount of room to grow for us.\nKaren Short : Okay. That's helpful. And then with respect to your '22 guidance on sales growth basically growing in line with EBIT, I mean if there's a sharp slowdown in sales at some point, can you just talk a little bit about what levers you have to remain within your EBIT guidance? And then just on that also, can you just remind us what you think your comp leverage point is now versus pre-pandemic?\nRichard McPhail : Well, again, it depends on the circumstance we find ourselves in. That's why we've created plenty of financial flexibility in our model. In a scenario where sales are decreasing, we have variable expense that decreases with sales. We have a degree of fixed expense that can be reduced. We have a degree of discretionary expense that can be reduced. But all of these things are levers that we have to consider in the moment. As far as a flex point, we've historically been able to drive operating expense leverage in low single-digit comp environments. We feel confident that we have the financial flexibility to continue to do that.\nTed Decker : And you've heard us say this before, Karen, but our largest operating expense is hourly payroll and having activity-based model. If sales drop off, transactions, units, et cetera, our labor model adjusts to that, and you reduce your labor expense.\nRichard McPhail : Manage it real time, yes, pretty real time as well.\nKaren Short : Right. Okay. And my congratulations to Craig and Ted as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America.\nLiz Suzuki : So I was hoping you could give an update just on the One Supply Chain strategy that you had discussed back at the Analyst Day in 2019. And what were you ultimately able to get done in those last 2 years adding FDCs, RDCs, MDOs. I mean there were a lot of facilities that were planned in the CapEx outlook. I'm sure there was some disruption due to COVID. So just curious how much of that CapEx outlook for '22 might include some of those One Supply Chain investments.\nCraig Menear : Yes. I'll give a bit of context on the One Supply Chain rollout, and then I'll let Richard comment on the CapEx. As Ted called out, our supply chain is an important component of the ecosystem we are building to better serve our customers and drive productivity. As you know, the intent of our supply chain transformation was to build the fastest, most efficient and reliable delivery network for home improvement products, reaching approximately 90% of the population with same- or next-day service for parcel, big and bulky and flatbed deliveries. Our original supply chain investment plan called for approximately 150 new facilities. And while many of these facilities will be complete by the end of 2022, some will take a bit longer due to the constraints we've seen as it relates to COVID and also taking into account our recent acquisition of HD Supply. In terms of our market delivery operations, or MDOs, we expect to have approximately 85 of the 100 that we plan fully operational by year-end. In terms of our market delivery centers, we have a handful open today, but I expect those will take a bit more time to roll out given the acquisition of HD Supply, which we required that we briefly pause the rollout in order to determine how legacy HD Supply assets would factor into our broader supply chain plans. This led us to a decision to rethink the scope of our MDC facilities, which were originally intended to carry the most delivered store SKUs as well as MRO SKUs. We decided that we would leverage the legacy HD Supply network for our MRO fulfillment, freeing up capacity in our MDCs so that we can better operate as a local, direct fulfillment center for store-based SKUs. Lastly, in terms of our flatbed distribution centers, we expect to end the year with approximately 15 or about half of our intended goal. The FDC in Dallas was the first we stood up. It has been operating for just over 2 years, and we really like what we're seeing out of this facility. But what we've learned is that it takes time to assort, optimize and really commercialize these buildings. So we're very pleased with the progress that we made regarding our One Supply Chain strategy but still have more work to do.\nRichard McPhail : And so just some clarification on the CapEx, the CapEx to complete One Supply Chain is embedded in our expectations for capital expenditures around 2% of sales. I think it's also really noteworthy to think that while there were some delays and some great opportunities we took after the acquisition of HD Supply to further optimize what these assets could mean to our end markets, we still grew by $40 billion over 2 years. And so while we're really sort of early days of One Supply Chain, it's one part of an ecosystem that has created tremendous market share capture and top line growth. We're excited to keep investing and -- as we are the rest of the ecosystem.\nTed Decker : Now I often say, Liz, that we talk here about running the business and changing the business with our new capabilities. And the supply chain team had to run the business during a pandemic and change the business. So they've done just a tremendous job.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill : First question, I just want to go back to -- you mentioned a couple of times the storm-like situation in the stores and that if you had more inventory or when you get the inventory, you're able to sell it pretty quickly. And yet transactions are down. So I just wanted to clarify, are you implying that transactions are down because you don't have the right in-stocks? Or are those 2 things unrelated?\nCraig Menear : There's certainly transaction pressure as a result of levels of inventory in certain categories. One of the pressured areas in the business over the last 1.5 years, if you will, has been in electrical. Our merchants did a phenomenal job, as Ted called out, I can't remember the last quarter or the quarter before on capturing more capacity in terms of getting goods, with the Carlon boxes becoming exclusive to The Home Depot. I mean we literally have seen the volume go up significantly. In-stock hasn't improved one iota because it moves off the shelf as fast as we get it. And so part of what's happening with our Pro customers, when they see goods, they're buying it. Where in the past, they might have bought it closer to a job and actually shop more frequently, they're actually grabbing what they see when they see it on the shelf.\nDennis McGill : Okay. That's helpful. And then longer term, on the market share side, as you think out over the next 2 or 3 years, are there certain categories in the store or departments in the store that you're most excited about share gain opportunity?\nTed Decker : Well, I mean, truly, it's across the store, Dennis. You've heard me go on before about innovation. We literally have innovation in every bay of the store. We remain a project business and I can't say any one project today, Jeff, your thoughts, is driving the business more than any other.\nJeff Kinnaird : Yes, it's across the store. If you think about the lumber business and composite decking; if you think about build materials in terms of the drywall and insulation and roofing categories. If you look at flooring, we talked about luxury vinyl tile and the LifeProof strategy, other hard surface flooring opportunities. If you look at Pro Paint and the opportunity we have there with PPG and BEHR. If you look at power tools in Milwaukee and RYOBI and other programs that we're driving across the 25-tool department; 26, 27, the plumber and the electrician. I mean, Ted, in 28, the outdoor garden category, it goes across the business in terms of market share opportunities to name a few.\nTed Decker : Yes, Dennis, so let me just build on Jeff's comment on Pro Paint. I mean we have just seen a tremendous growth in our paint business. With BEHR, we've had the one consumer brand and highest-rated consumer brand for some time. And in working with each of PPG and BEHR to put together a very formidable Pro go-to-market strategy, we -- BEHR has formulated Pro-specific paint that's in our store. They also have, as you've heard us mention before, outside sales force, working with our outside sales force and our stores to, again, get that larger Pro planned purchase in paint. And we're doing this exact same thing with PPG. PPG has very large external sales force. They are now introducing their PPG-branded paint. So think of SPEEDHIDE paint. This is the specced paint for the Pro market that PPG is introducing in our stores for the very first time, and then also leveraging their stores and their outside sales force. We're absolutely thrilled with our 2 supplier go-to-market proposition and getting these Pro brands and external sales forces. We're just -- we couldn't be happier with what we're building in Pro paint.\nOperator: Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in May.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel. And good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong performance on the third quarter. Sales for the third quarter were $36.8 billion up 9.8% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.1% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 5.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.92 in the third quarter, up from $3.18 in the third quarter last year. Home improvement demand remains strong. Our customers remain engaged with projects around the home, and we continue to focus on delivering the best experience in retail. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see customers taking on larger home improvement projects as evidenced by the continued strength with our pro customer, which once again outpaced the DIY customer.  As been the case for the last 18 months, the team is doing an outstanding job of navigating a fluid and challenging operating environment. Ultimately, this is what has allowed us to respond to the strong home improvement demand that has persisted. We have positive comps every week despite unprecedented compares last year and grew sales by $3.3 billion in the third quarter. Bringing total sales growth year-to-date to more than $15.5 billion through the third quarter. From a geographic perspective, all of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps versus last year in both Canada and Mexico posted positive comps. These results were driven by our associate to maintain their relentless focus on our customers while simultaneously managing industry-wide supply chain disruptions, inflation, and a tight labor market.  While these factors present challenges for retail as a whole, we will use our experience tools and our scale to manage through this environment with the intent to deliver a strong value proposition to our customers. We're thankful for the 10-year and strength of our relationships with our supplier and transportation partners. Our respective teams have worked tirelessly to build depth in key product categories and to flow products to our stores and distribution centers as quickly and efficiently as possible. I would like to thank them for their ongoing efforts as we continue to navigate one of the most challenging environments we have ever faced. Beyond the current environment we are focused on positioning ourselves for growth. We are investing in stores to drive further productivity, which Ted will discuss.  We are enhancing the interconnected shopping experience, by investing to remove friction for our customers wherever possible. And the build-out of our supply chain vision continues to progress and we remain on track with our plans. We are encouraged by the results that we're seeing from buildings that we have stood up as we optimize and assort these facilities to unlock their full potential. We believe that the network we are building is unique to the market. It will not only enhance the customer experience from a delivery standpoint, but also expand the opportunity to capture wallet share gains with both new and existing customers, drive efficiency end-to-end, and leverage our scale to further extend our low-cost position in home improvement. In the near term, we remain focused on being flexible and agile as we navigate this dynamic environment.  But we also continue to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance the interconnected shopping experience in support of our goals to drive growth faster than the market in any environment, further strengthen our position as a low-cost provider in home improvement with a relentless focus on productivity and efficiency and deliver exceptional shareholder value. Our ability to invest for the future while also managing the most fluid environment in our Company's history, is a direct result of our associates and their extraordinary offers. I want to thank all of our associates for the many ways they continue to live our values by serving our customers and communities. In conjunction with Veterans Day last week, the Home Depot Foundation announced that is now surpassed $400 million invested in support of U.S. military veterans since 2011.  This brings us closer to achieving our goal to invest a $0.5 billion in veteran causes by 2025. We are in support our military veterans and families and we thank them for their service to our country. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig. And good morning, everyone. We had a great third quarter. I want to start by thanking all our associates as well as their supplier and transportation partners for their unwavering commitment to serving our customers and communities in what remains a very challenging operating environment. There is no question that pressures on global supply chains increased over the last 18 months. That being said, we could not be more pleased with how our cross-functional teams responded. The teams took a number of decisive actions to secure more product for our customers while continue to find new and different ways to flow that product. Beginning in the second quarter of last year, our merchant inventory and supply chain teams leveraged tools and analytics and worked with our vendor partners to adjust our assortments and in some cases, introduced alternative products.  The teams also built depth in job lot quantities in high demand products. We improved our in-stock levels in the back half of last year, and we've been able to sustain and in some cases improve our levels even as home improvement demand remains elevated. In addition to the challenging supply chain environment, we're also seeing rising cost pressures across several different product categories. Our season teams of merchandising, finance, and data analytics associates are working with our supplier partners to manage through these pressures. We have effectively managed inflationary environments in the past, and we feel good about our ability to continue managing through the current environment while being our customers advocate for value.  Turning to our comp performance during the third quarter, 12 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps, appliances, plumbing, electrical, building materials, tools, kitchen and bath, to corn storage [Indiscernible] and flooring had comps above the Company average. Paint, outdoor garden in hardware were positive but below the Company average, indoor garden was essentially flat in lumber posted a high-single-digit negative comp compared with lumber comps in more than 50 % in the third quarter of 2020. On a 2-year basis, each of our departments posted healthy double-digit positive comps. Our comp average ticket increased 12.7% and comp transactions decreased 5.8%. Growth in our comp average ticket was driven in part by inflation across several product categories. Our commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 70 basis points in the third quarter, driven by inflation in copper and building materials, which was partially offset by deflation lumber.  On a 2-year basis, both comp average ticket and conference actions were healthy and positive. Big ticket comp transactions, so those over $1,000 were up approximately 18 % compared to the third quarter of last year. During the third quarter pro sales, growth continued to outpace DIY growth. On a 2-year comp basis, growth with both our Pro and DIY customers was consistent [Indiscernible] Similar to the second quarter, we saw many of our customers turn to Pros for help with larger projects. We see this in the strength several Pro-heavy categories like drywall, [Indiscernible], pipe and fittings, and several mill work categories. We remain encouraged by what we're hearing from our pros as they tell us their backlogs are healthy.  Sales, leveraging our digital platforms grew approximately 8 % for the third quarter, which brings our digital 2-year growth to approximately 95 %. Our customers continue to shop with us in an interconnected manner, is approximately 55 % of our online orders are fulfilled through our stores. While we navigate these challenging environment, we continue to invest in our business to enhance the customer shopping experience, while also driving productivity and efficiency. We believe we have a significant opportunity to further optimize space productivity in our stores by balancing the art and science of retail. This is a continuous process that we believe leads to better, more productive assortments in space allocations, which ultimately drives value for our customers. Let me take a moment to comment on some unique capabilities we've built that showcase what I mean. More than a year ago we started to test in some of our higher volume stores. The idea was, how can we further drive space productivity and improve the shopping experience at the same time? Our cross-functional teams applied a combination of space optimization models in conjunction with the expertise of our local field merchants, many of whom have more than 30 years of tenure with the Home Depot to create store specific outcomes that adjust assortments and improve space utilization. The results exceeded our expectations. Sales per square foot improved, on-shelf availability improved, voice of the customer scores improved, labor utilization improved, and during the process, we were able to add net new base to the stores.  As a result, we went from a small test to now targeting more than 400 stores this year with more in the pipeline for next year. I want to recognize all the teams helping drive the success. As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we're excited about the upcoming holiday season. During the third quarter, we hosted our Halloween event and could not be happier with the results. We saw record sales and sell-through as customers responded to our exclusive product offerings in innovative approach to the category. During the fourth quarter, we intend to continue this momentum with our Annual holiday, Black Friday and Gift Center events. Last year, we extended these events to cover a longer period and not just focus on one day. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard Mcphail: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, total sales were $36.8 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion or 9.8% from last year. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted total sales by approximately $190 million. During the third quarter, our total Company comps were positive 6.1%, with positive comps in all 3 months. We saw a total Company comps of 3.1% in August, 4.5% in September, and 9.9% in October. Comps in the U.S. were positive 5.5% for the quarter with comps of 2.2% in August, 4 % in September, and 9.6% in October. In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.1%, a decrease of approximately 5 basis points from the same period last year. While there are many factors that impact gross margin, margin during the third quarter, our gross margin was negatively impacted by higher transportation costs and mix of products sold, which was partially offset by higher retail prices.  During the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 130 basis points to 18.4%. Our operating leverage during the third quarter reflects the lapping of significant COVID related expenses that we incurred in the third quarter of 2020 to support our associates, as well as payroll leverage. Our operating margin for the third quarter was 15.7%, an increase of approximately 125 basis points from the third quarter of 2020. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was essentially flat with the same period last year. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.5%, up from 24.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.92, an increase of 23.3% compared to the third quarter of 2020.  At the end of the quarter, inventories were $20.6 billion, up $4.4 billion from last year. And inventory returns were 5.4 times compared with 5.9 times this time last year. Turning to capital allocation after investing in our business is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As we have mentioned on previous calls, we plan to continue investing in our business with capex of approximately 2 % of sales on an annual basis. We also plan to maintain flexibility to move faster or slower depending on the environment. A good illustration of this is what you heard from Ted. We built capabilities to drive productivity across some of our higher volume stores. We tested them, we saw strong results across key performance metrics, and we moved quickly to expand the investment.  During the third quarter, we invested approximately $700 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, bringing year-to-date capital expenditures to approximately $1.7 billion. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $1.7 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months. Return on invested capital was approximately 43.9% up from 41.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. As you've heard from Craig, we're very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the third quarter, particularly as we lap the unprecedented growth we saw this time last year.  Customer engagement remains strong, and demand for home improvement is healthy. We've been pleased with our team's ability to navigate the challenging environment. However, we do not believe we can accurately predict how the external environment and cost pressures will evolve and how they will ultimately impact consumer spending. As we've mentioned on previous calls, our teams are managing our business on a relatively short cycle, and we will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what has driven our successful performance to date. Longer term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning formula for our customers, our associates, and our shareholders.  We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement, we intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider, and we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. If we do these things, we believe we'll continue to grow faster than our market and we will deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [ Operator instructions ]. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. [Operators instructions ] One moment please while we pull for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi everyone. Good morning. Nice quarter.\nCraig Menear: Thanks.\nSimeon Gutman: My first question -- you're welcome. My first question is actually something I've asked last quarter, and it's around demand reversion and whether the industry goes through some digestion phase or it continues to compound just to add this quarter, it looks like there was very little reversion and demand seems to be holding even though we're probably getting out of stimulus. So curious if you have any different thoughts about the demand progression.\nCraig Menear: I wish we actually do the exact answer to that. Clearly we don't. And so one of the things that we've stayed focused on as a result then is, how do we make sure that we're as flexible and agile as possible and deal with whatever comes our way. That has worked well for us so far. I -- we've delivered strong performance. We're going to continue to be as nimble as we possibly can. I can't believe we had expected that as the year progress ed, you might see customers reverting back and spending in other areas and that may have affected us, but we really haven't seen that. Demand continues to remain strong; customers continue to tell us if they have projects on their list, pros tell us that their backlogs are significant. So we're gonna stay focused on filling that demand.\nRichard Mcphail: And in --\nSimeon Gutman: Okay\nRichard Mcphail: -- to add to -- just to add something, obviously we saw acceleration in October. What's interesting to note is that we saw improvement in both ticket and transactions sequentially from September to October. So we think that's a sign of the customers engaged in demand is healthy.\nSimeon Gutman: That's right. And then maybe the follow-up is on the profit outlook or operating income. And I know we're not -- we don't really cling to margin goals anymore, it's more of operating profit dollar growth, or EBITDA growth. I was curious if this environment inhibits your ability to grow at the rates you want to grow in terms of operating profit or the consumer tends to take price in this segment and you can pass along price, okay. And therefore, overtime that shouldn't have an impact, meaning the operating profit dollar growth doesn't get touched.\nCraig Menear: What I'd say is, for the quarter and for the year-to-date Simeon, we're very pleased with our performance. And I think that our teams -- and Ted alluded to this, but the job we do in understanding and mitigating cost pressures, and then as appropriate using a portfolio approach to cover those costs has been impressive. And so we're happy with the P&L would deliver in Q3.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay, thanks. Good quarter.\nCraig Menear: you. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS, please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nMichael Lasser: Let me pose -- gross margins declined 10 out of the last 11 quarters. There was a moderation in the decline this quarter. Is the period of gross margin degradation coming to an end, and has this line item stabilized given the retail price increases that you're passing along. And what was the impact from non-commodity related inflation to your comp in gross margin this quarter?\nCraig Menear: Michael, I'd say one of the things we've shared with you all is we're very, very focused on how do we drive incremental op profit dollars. And there's multiple ways to get there. And so that is our number 1 focus. It's not that we completely ignore rate. We obviously don't ignore rate in total. But you don't take rate to the banks. So we are really laser-focused on the incremental operating profit dollar growth. And we're very pleased. We said that in 2021 it would be a year of much more transparency on operating expense leverage, and that's what we've been focused on delivering. On the last part of your question, we don't take the approach that we have costs on a unit basis, and retails and costs move independently. And so if -- Ted (ph ), if you think about just how that relationship worked\nTed Decker: Yeah, Michael, I would say from a gross margin perspective, there was very little net impact from product cost pressures. So as Richard said, we don't look at things necessarily on a unit-to-unit basis, but our merchants are well-versed with running their portfolios. And while we have certainly seen non-commodity cost impacts, those have largely been offset by increases overall in the retail portfolio. Our cost pressures or the margin pressures that we've seen in the past have been more related to our supply chain build-out, delivered sales, mix of product sales. We've talked about the appliance business in the past as an example, which is an incredibly productive, high-growth business with extremely high given ROI because of our inventory position, but not necessarily the highest gross margin category.  If you look at our ticket growth, certainly there's an AUR, significant AUR double-digit growth. Certainly, essentially half of that is from product costs that we have passed on. But it's important to note that our Pro and consumer customers remain incredibly engaged in this category, and innovation and newness still sells in this marketplace. And the equal amount of our AUR was driven by mix in new product innovation. So think of things like appliances, the technological in features and benefits that have been introduced into appliances, grills in pellet grill smokers or outdoor power equipment and power tools with the battery platforms.  We just launched a new exclusive paint from Bear and Dynasty, this is the best paint that Home Depot has ever introduced. It's over $50 a gallon, All-in on-shelf. It's performing incredibly well as customers trade up to the innovation, etc. So yes, there's cost pressures that the merchants have offset, but equally doing terrific job finding new and innovative products that our customers are engaging.\nMichael Lasser: That's very helpful. Thank you so much. My quick follow-up is the planning period associated with the One Home Depot is coming to a conclusion. Should we expect a step-up in operating expense investments as you move to 2022 and beyond as you have to continue to build out the capabilities that you've been deploying, plus wage inflation is going to continue to be quite hot?\nCraig Menear: As you -- so, as we've said, we look at investment principally through the proxy of capital expenditures, and what we believe an appropriate level will be is around 2 % of sales, and that can vary. But you can think of that in your mind as where, we expect to be. Beyond that, the associated operating expense is embedded in our cost structure now and so it's just a normal part of our cost structure moving forward. There will always be fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. We have productivity initiatives; we have investment initiatives. There's a nice flywheel there of self-funding. And again, quarter-to-quarter, you may see fluctuation, but operating expense investments, that's just part of us now.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim, Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. I wanted to start with Pro customer trends. So curious, if you could discuss whether you're seeing an acceleration in new Pros and maybe of all sizes migrate to Home Depot's offering, given the industry-wide supply chain challenges. And then also the pricing environment, which I believe really weighs on the value proposition of the independent. So just any comment on growth in new pros. And if there is any difference among the size of the Pros themselves.\nCraig Menear: Yeah, we're actually very pleased, Steven (ph ), with our overall continued growth with the Pro customer. Obviously, our larger Pros were more challenged during the pandemic and we've seen that recover. What's really nice to see is on a two-year basis, really the conversion of both our Pro and our consumers growing at pretty comparable rates. And that is what we always strive to do. We are attracting new Pros into the business and Ted (ph ), I don't know if you want to comment on that?\nTed Decker: Yeah, we're happy, Stephen, across our progression with our larger Pros and our smaller Pros. We've talked about their pipelines being healthy, record levels of remodel indexes in the marketplace. And what we liked about the Pros are they're responding to the capabilities that we've been building. So we've relaunched our Pro loyalty program. We're seeing record enrollment in engagement with the new loyalty program. The Pros are responding to our capabilities in terms of delivered sales in our new supply chain. And if you take a category like paint, for example, where we've had a Pro Paint program for some time. We're in a terrific position with our 2 key paint suppliers, TPG in bear, and we've seen a terrific uptake with our Pro Paint volume, as Pros continue to respond to the Pro Paint itself the formulations, the pricing, and the service levels. So our Pros are active across the business and engaging in all categories.\nSteven Forbes: And that's helpful, maybe leads to the follow-up on the B2B website. And I don't know if you can comment on what you're seeing in regards to repeat behavior, retention rates. In the point that I'm trying to get there, it almost appears that this is a great environment for share capture and new customer growth for you. And I don't if you're sort of seeing elevated share were elevated repeat right in retention rate within the B2B website that makes the stickiness of new customer growth apparent?\nTed Decker: Yes.\nSteven Forbes: Any comment, there would be helpful.\nTed Decker: Yes, absolutely. The ecosystem we're putting in place when you think of the B2B website, when you think of the new loyalty program or the revamped loyalty program. Also translating into the Pro app. We're seeing record traffic on the app. The app traffic is growing. The Pro traffic on the app is growing. Basket sizes and tickets and engagement is growing. And our teams are doing an excellent job in stitching what we call households together. So our understanding and knowledge of all our customers, but particularly our Pro customers, because they are engaging with us at a much higher frequency than the average consumer.  We're able to stitch all that behavior together in a much more robust understanding of that customer and able to make direct contact with them through our digital marketing channels, and our outreach with our field sales, our teams, as well as our Pro associates in the store, so that the entire Pro ecosystem with heavy emphasis on the digital capabilities is coming together extremely nicely in driving that stickiness and sure [Indiscernible]\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with DA Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Baker: Thanks, guys. And so I know you're probably not talking about fourth quarter guidance, but one thing I've noticed is that your fourth quarter very often, in fact, I think not in the last 12 years has been better than your third quarter. I think that's because of you guys continuing to lean more and more into holiday products. But I'm wondering what you think of that. Why is your fourth quarter typically such a strong quarter? And maybe while we're talking about that, I know you said you're please with the beginning of the quarter, oftentimes you give a little bit more color on the first couple of weeks, I'm wondering if you're willing to share any of that. Thanks.\nCraig Menear: The fourth quarter -- why has our fourth-quarter been stronger? I think we've brought tremendous value to the customer in the fourth quarter through the events that Ted talked about that we've done for multiple years now. Our merchants continue to focus on innovative products. Ted mentioned in his prepared remarks around the Halloween events that was largely driven by just amazing innovative product that they brought into the marketplace. So I think in general, I think our team has done an outstanding job of delivering value to the customer in the fourth quarter. As we look forward into the fourth quarter, we know that there is continued pressure that we're facing around costs which our teams will work to manage.  We're still working some replenishment goods on our events out of the ports and so we've got work to do there as well. And of course, in Q4 winter hits, so you never know how that's going to play out. And over the past few years, that hasn't been a big impact. So we've been very, very pleased to your point on how our fourth quarter has progressed over the years.\nRichard Mcphail: And just to give you some color on how the fourth-quarter has begun, the comp sales for the first two weeks of the fourth quarter are running a little higher than what we reported for the entirety of the third quarter. But as Craig said, we're managing this on a short-cycle basis in the current environment and are happy with how we've done it to date. But we attack this thing every day.\nTed Decker: And Mike, I would say just can't give enough credit for the merchants and the programs they have put together over several years for the fourth quarter in leveraging our lay-down space in the front of the store, in developing the gift center that truly just gets better and better each year. And if you walk our stores and you see the product and the values that the merchants are bringing to the marketplace. And you just look at the brand statement, to see the RYOBI, and the Milwaukee, and the Makita, and DEWALT, and the Klein and the, DIABLO. These are just the premier brands in the industry that the spring unbelievable value in the most powerful gift center in our industry and just hats off to the merchant team and the great work they're doing.\nMichael Baker: Thanks. That\u2019s great color. One more completely unrelated question, but Walmart, a lot of us are just on the Walmart call that they just said that they've actually seen it a little bit easier to hire people over the last couple of weeks or month since some of the employment stimulus has run out. Are you seeing anything along those lines? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: I mean, we've been fortunate in the sense that we've been able to hire a lots of people throughout 2021 and we use everything at our disposable as it relates to our brand, to our culture, to the total offering that we have, the growth opportunities for our associates. That's not to say that we don't have markets where there's pressure and there's always been markets that are more pressured than others, but we've been very pleased with our ability to hire folks.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on to someone else.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett, please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Hey, thank you very much recorder. I was wondering we get an update on the one supply chain roll-out, I guess where you are in the development of that when we should expect to see better inventory availability and also some efficiencies on the distribution side.\nTed Decker: Sure Chuck. We're very pleased. We're right on schedule with the roll out, and as you know that this is a number of platforms, so I'll try and give a quick rundown. Our transition to our new bulk distribution centers [Indiscernible] replenishing our stores with lumber and building materials which is going incredibly well. Our flatbed distribution centers that are often tied to those bulk distribution centers, we have 7 or 8 of those up and running now. Those that are relieving the stores of the delivery volume out of the stores, as well as being a capability to capture more share of the Pro wallet, or direct fulfillment centers. Again, we've opened up about 7 of those. Those are going to be an expansion of we had 3 or 4 purpose built pick pack and ship facilities.  And as we look to cover 90 % of the country same or next day delivery, what will ultimately be 20 odd plus direct fulfillment centers will allow us to cover 90 % of the country in parcel sale in next day. And then finally, our MDOs, which is our flow-through for big and bulky product, particularly appliances. We're about halfway through the rollout there and we've taken over the delivery of about half of our appliance volume at this point. So all are on target, progressing nicely and performing at expectations.\nRichard Mcphail: I think it's also important to note, Chuck (ph ), that, as Ted (ph ) said, we're progressing nicely. Our teams are doing an incredible job. We also reserve the right to move appropriately. We've pivoted a few times during this development as we learned how to optimize the commercial offerings, and I don't think we're done learning yet. We're going to roll out at the right pace, and the right pace means doing this right, learning, pivoting, and optimizing the commercial promise of the network.\nChuck Grom: That's very helpful. Thank you very much. And then just one near term question. You talked about the Pro backlog being healthy, just wondering if you could put that into some context for us. Has it actually increased to a degree, given that maybe some people put off projects due to the rise in lumber and now the lumbers come down and we started to see an increase? Just wanted to put some context on that.\nCraig Menear: I mean, the conversations that we have with our Pros. They have basically been multiple weeks and months and backlog and that continues. So I have not seen any major shift.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan, please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So it looks like extra labor day ship August and September were pretty consistent, and then you had that really strong acceleration in October and on it to your basis, so can you talk about what you think drove that to your acceleration? How much do you think maybe was price and do you have any concern that maybe we pulled forward some of the holiday and seasonal spending given all the local news around, you better get to the store and pick up your fake Christmas tree? Thanks.\nCraig Menear: Sure, Chris, I'll start and then let some other comments come in. I'd say the first thing to recognize is that, that acceleration was broad based. We saw Pros, consumers online. It all accelerated and as we moved through the quarter. So we're very pleased to see that. I think in part as we're still high compared to norms, but as lumber came down to more reasonable levels, compared to the last couple of years, we certainly saw an acceleration there and that always carries across the store. Lumber used drive our projects throughout the business and that certainly carries on. So we're really pleased with the broad-based, it was geographic as well. We actually saw a narrowing of geographic variance during the quarter. So we're very, very pleased with how that played out.\nRichard Mcphail: And as we said, ticket and transaction both improved sequentially. The open question obviously will be how the consumer reacts in the future. But at least for October, both of those moves in positive direction.\nChristopher Horvers: [Indiscernible]\nTed Decker: There's a lot of the season to come, so we're certainly pleased with the response to the gift centers I mentioned in our decorative holiday program. The Christmas sets are following the strength of the Halloween, but we're earlier in the ramp up towards where the volumes come in starting next week, Thanksgiving week so, a lot to go in the fourth quarter, but the ramp looks good.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then as a follow-up, you've alluded a little bit to price elasticity. Are you seeing any of it? You have some pretty rapid inflation in areas like major appliances, I would assume anything coming in from Asia has a lot of freight driven inflation. So in some of those bigger ticket areas, or anywhere in the mix, are you seeing any price elasticity which sort of is compressing volume perhaps down, which I think Whirlpool talked about, but more than offset just by price.\nTed Decker: Yeah. I would say certainly we watch it very carefully. We have not seen it broadly. I think lumber was the best example as Craig (ph ) just alluded to. And lumber prices were 3 and 4x. The near-term levels, we clearly saw unit\u2019s drop-off, which then leads to project dropping off across the store as lumber prices came down. And as we sit today, for example, framing is up only about 5 % on last year, and panel is slightly below last year and if you look back at the end of the second quarter, those prices were up significantly over prior year's framing, it had peaked out at roughly $1,500 were down at about $575. So lumber, clearly a commodity, very representative of the elasticities across the rest of the business. We haven't seen specific falloffs in categories because of overly robust, if you will, cost moves. Watching it carefully, but so far have not seen it.\nCraig Menear: And I think it's important to note looking through the cost environment, it's still dynamic. Pressures are building. And so as Ted says, we haven't seen specific instances to date, but we're in a unique cost environment.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And just to sneak in one last one is, as you think about mix in the fourth quarter, does it generally have more of products that's sourced as out of Asia such that -- so that supply chain pressure that's hung up in inventory is a bigger pressure as we look at the fourth quarter?\nTed Decker: The mix, yes, Chris, so say you think of the mix of gift center product, less outdoor product, which is with to -- you think that the garden department and pressure treated lumber and more outdoor lumber-oriented projects, those are suppressed somewhat in the fourth quarter. So your mix of tools and the like that that are largely sourced from overseas does impact Q4. And as credit said, we've received most of the goods for the fourth quarter, but there is still product and we have 95 odd shifts in total parked outside LA Long Beach, and we track our containers on those ships and also getting onto the ports and off the port. So we're not too terribly concerned. It isn't huge amounts of Q4, but there is Q4 products still working through the supply chain.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Have a great holiday Season. Thanks.\nTed Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays, please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: Hi, thanks very much. So 1 bigger picture question is I think definitely heard from investor push-back that this elevated demand that we've seen is basically just going to be reduced back to the normal term once we get into 2022. And I'm wondering what your perspective is on that because that doesn't seem likely. It just seems to me that the actual TAM is significantly higher on a much more permanently embedded basis. And then I had another quick question.\nCraig Menear: Karen, I think most people and if you looked at what economists are saying as the year started, everybody believed during 2021 that we'd see a significant shift away from good back to services as the economic environment opened up, as we got our arms around the pandemic. Clearly, we have not seen that. I say that from the standpoint that yes, you've seen things like travel and restaurants opened up, but the customers continue to spend in the home improvement space, and to-date, we have not seen that dramatic shift back that everybody predicted. We're going to stay focus. We think that the underlying factors for the home improvement industry are strong and we're going to do everything we can to serve that demand going forward.\nRichard Mcphail: I think long-term when you look at all the factors, we believe that driven home improvement demand. We were in a very supportive environment, short term, harder to know where that demand moves, but long term, there's a lot of support.\nKaren Short: Thanks. Got it.\nCraig Menear: And Karen, your point on total market. We're actually doing some refresh work on that right now. We'll probably talk more about that to you later on in the year, but we're resizing the market right now.\nKaren Short: Okay. Great. And then just on this quarter in particular, so sales growth versus the EBIT growth. That relationship is obviously very volatile given all the moving parts, but EBITDA growth relative to sales growth certainly widened in 3Q relative to 2Q. Wondering how to think about that relationships in 4Q.\nRichard Mcphail: Well, so there are really -- there is no typical quarter. I think we're pleased with the quarter; we're pleased with year-to-date. There's always going to be fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. If you think about Q3 flow-through, there are really 3 significant dynamics. The first is that we're anniversarying significant COVID related compensation and benefits from last year, but recall that we reinvested a good bit of that in the form of permanent wage increases at the end of last year. The second dynamic is just the comparison between ticket and transaction comp. When ticket comp is higher than transaction because our payroll model is activity based, you're going to see more leverage than when you see in the converse when transaction outpaces ticket. So we saw leverage benefit there.  And then finally to a much lesser degree, as Craig said, we've hired a lot of people this year and feel great about how our stores are operating. We at the same time probably could have seen staffing a little higher if we had had our preference and we'll continue to work on that.\nCraig Menear: Candidly, we do not expect October acceleration at the rate that it was. And so we probably had some opportunities from a staffing standpoint on October.\nRichard Mcphail: But as far as flow-through goes, again, we do have cost pressure in the environment. We see product costs, we see transportation costs, we see wage pressure. And all those things are real elements of today's economy. So we will continue to manage our best through it, but yes, we are very pleased with the quarter.\nKaren Short: Great. Thanks very much. Have a good holiday.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo, please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. As you think about all the favorable long-term indicators around housing. Be it turnover, home price appreciation, contractor backlog, etc. Are there any of these items more front and center in terms of driving demand today? And as you think about the strength of your performance in the quarter, what would you attribute to the robust external environment versus what would you categorize is share gain?\nCraig Menear: I mean, I'd say a couple of things here. First of all, when you look at the constraint availability of new housing that clearly is having a positive impact on home values. And when customers home values are in a positive side of a ledger they feel good about investing in their homes. So I think that is for sure an element that is helping the overall home [Indiscernible] dynamic. That new housing availability shortage probably going to get solved anytime soon at the rate that we're building homes, even though it's an accelerated rate from where it's been, that backlog is going to be there for quite some time.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And then as you look to 2022 and beyond, I realize you aren't providing any guidance. But as you think about all the drivers of your business today, what do you think will be the primary areas of upside? Be it from the Pro, DIY, innovation, your strategic initiatives. Any thoughts there?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. I mean, we think it's kind of all of the above. We know we have an enormous opportunity with our Pro customers, particularly as we enhance our capabilities to grab a larger share of spend with the planned purchase with larger Pros. And we believe that innovation, which is a huge element of both Pro consumer of it, is certainly a driver for the consumer as well. And people have spent a lot of time around their homes so they tell us that they've got project list that are things that they want to get done. And so we feel good about the opportunity that exists with both the Pro and the consumer looking forward.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Thanks for the time, Craig.\nCraig Menear: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Congratulations. Nice quarter.\nCraig Menear: Thanks.\nBrian Nagel: The quick -- first question I have. Now you had talked maybe a quarter, maybe 2 ago that -- just about how consumers were shopping at your stores and as the pandemic was beginning to ease, what you saw was a shift from weekend spending to weekday spending. I guess, just from this to help us understand better how this is -- how your traffic is progressing. Obviously, continued very strong. But are you seeing any further shift in just the way people are shopping in the stores?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. Actually, throughout third quarter we saw a re-acceleration of weekend traffic flow with no real deceleration during the week. And as I mentioned earlier, that we saw consumer growth go up, Pro growth go up, online growth goes up, geographically narrowed. So we were very, very pleased with the broad base improvement that we saw in all of those segments of our business, and the increase on the weekends.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. It's helpful, but the second question I have really look, recognizing it's difficult to gauge market share in short periods of time, particularly against such a fluid backdrop. But there's -- given the extraordinary lengths that Home Depot has gone to manage your supply chain pressures and you've done so well, do you think or do you see in your data that you're actually capturing increased share now from competitors out there, maybe [Indiscernible] competitors that are just not managing the supply chain as well as you are?\nCraig Menear: I mean, when we look at share, it's obviously a triangulation, there's no perfect data, but when you look at multiple different data points, whether that's from government data, from independent third-parties that track share, and then of course there's our conversations with our suppliers and what they're putting into the marketplace, we believe that we're continuing to gain share. We think that our investments that we've made have helped us be in a position to continue to grow share. That was the objective behind why we made the investments. We want to be able to grow faster into the market in any environment whatsoever. And we feel like we're doing that right now.  Exactly who we're taking that share for them is a little bit hard to know. We plan a really big market and it's highly fragmented. And so we think that we're capturing share. But based on category that can be very, very different.\nTed Decker: Yeah, Brian, I would say if you look at look at the NYSE data, that's the venous look would indicate yet another quarter of taking share. But as we think about our scale and our position in the marketplace with the shortage of goods and particularly in certain categories, we've been very pleased with responses from long-term supplier partners and in some cases, supplier partners saying, we can't service the industry, so we'd rather focus on the best partner and we've called out in prior quarters with LP [Indiscernible] Louisiana Pacific, moving with us on OSP and Exclusive Manner. Car Lawn, which is the box in electrical PVC boxes, moving to us exclusive. Henry Roof Coatings, just thrilled to mention this today.  I just announced that they will be moving to us exclusive as well. A Levinton which is the share leader in wiring devices. Another robust category exclusive to the Home Depot. And I mentioned earlier the position we're in with having joined supply from Bear and Masco, as well as PPG and Paint, has given us great flow of Liquid paint product as well. So I think our suppliers are leaning into the Home Depot and we couldn't be happier and more thankful with those -- for those relationships.\nBrian Nagel: Thanks, Ted. I appreciate all the color congrats again. Thank you.\nTed Decker: Thank you.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman, please proceed with your question.\nDennis Mcgill: Thank you guys. Just a couple of quick ones and then a bigger picture. On the acceleration from September and October, Richard, do you have any specifics behind how comp transactions trended, how much of an improvement you saw?\nRichard Mcphail: Don't want to break that out, but the degree is improvement in transactions and ticket were roughly equivalent.\nDennis Mcgill: Perfect. And then any impact from the Northeast, Ida storms that you see in the data?\nRichard Mcphail: Maybe a 100 million, not necessarily material, but obviously proud that we can be there for our community assisting.\nDennis Mcgill: Okay. Perfect. And then Ted, maybe bigger picture on the supply chain, just curious a lot of people obviously speculating how long some of these challenges can persist. How do you think about maybe the bigger bottlenecks and how long those are maybe going to persist, and how you guys would be able to maintain some of these advantages, It seems you have in the marketplace with your superior supply chain infrastructure.\nTed Decker: Well, I think from the market it's hard to judge, but I would say this goes well into if not through 2022. And we'll keep doing what we're doing with the innovation we've talked in leveraging our scale, as well as our new assets. When you think of our inventory growth, part of that is stocking these new facilities. So not only have we improved our in-store stocking levels and been able to meet the accelerating demand through the quarter. But we're also starting -- not starting, we're stocking all those new facilities that I talked about. So we're clearly getting disproportionate flow. And as for our merchants and supply chain teams, we'll continue to push.\nDennis Mcgill: Okay. Thank you. Good luck, guys.\nRichard Mcphail: Thank you.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Miss Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thanks, Christine, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference, you may disconnect your lines at this time.

These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning. We were pleased with our performance in the Second Quarter as we achieved over $40 billion in quarterly sales for the first time in our history. Sales from the second quarter were 41.1 billion, up 8.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.5% from last year with the U.S. comps of a positive 3.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.53 in the second quarter, up from $4.2 in the second quarter last year. The strong underlying demand across the business continues. During the second quarter, we did observe some changing consumer patterns in the U.S. as the U.S. economy opened up. This has manifested itself in several ways. We have seen a shift in pattern of sales within the week, as our weekday sales performance is actually strengthened relative to the weekend. We attributed this to consumers returning to travel and other recreational activities. And while the consumers returning to pre-pandemic activities, we continue to see them engaged in home improvement projects. We also see customers more comfortable taking on larger projects, as evidenced by the continued strength with our Pro customer, which outpaced the DIY customer for the second quarter in a row. We remained as [Indiscernible] flexible and we're pleased with our ability to respond to strong home improvement demand and comp-the-comp in the second quarter. We had positive comps every week despite our precedent in compares last year and grew sales by $3.1 billion in the second quarter, and more than $12 billion year-to-date. Over the last 6 quarters, we have grown the business by more than $34 billion, a level unmatched in our market. From a geographic perspective, 15 of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps versus last year. On a two-year stock basis, all 19 regions are strong double-digit comp growth. However, unlike the past 4 quarters, the Second Quarter, we did experience some variability and performance from a geographic perspective. The variability in our regional performance is driven by our Northern division, where we saw a more pronounced shift in sales with stronger sales in outdoor seasonal categories during the First Quarter. Mexico posted double-digit positive comps, and despite significant customer restrictions during the quarter due to COVID-19, Canada posted comps that were essentially flat in local currency. We continue to effectively manage the strong demand for home improvement products despite significant industry disruptions in supply chains. We are leveraging the scale of our supply chain and partnership with our vendors to prioritize key skews and high-demand categories. And while our in-stocks are not where we want them to be, they have improved from where they were a year ago, and our network continues to flow goods remarkably well thanks to the investments we have made in our supply chain over a number of years. The team continues to make progress on building out our One Home Depot Supply Chain vision. We remain largely on track with our plans with a critical mass of buildings scheduled to come online this year and next. We believe that the network we are building is unique to the market. It will not only enhance the customer experience from a delivery standpoint, but also expand the breadth and depth of our current opportunity set, drive efficiency end, and leverage our scale to further extend our low cost position in home improvement. In the near-term, we remain focused on being flexible and agile as we navigate this dynamic environment. But we also continue to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments, to further enhance interconnected shopping experience in support of our goals, to drive growth faster than market in any environment, further strengthen our position as a low-cost provider in home improvement with a relentless focus on productivity and efficiency, and deliver exceptional shareholder value. Throughout all the events of the past 18 months, our culture has remained our North Star. In fact, I recently spent time with a number of new associates that we have hired in the past year and was struck by how engaged and connected these associates were to The Home Depot culture. They were onboarded during a time when our stores and teams were busier than ever.  But our associates took the time to get to know these new folks and share what it means to be part of the orange blooded family. Our ability to invest for the future while also managing the most fluid environment in our Company history, is a direct result of our associates and their extraordinary efforts. I want to close by thanking them for the many ways they continue to live our values by serving our customers, communities, and each other. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig and good morning everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Craig, during the Second Quarter we continue to see strong performance in our business, particularly as we lap the significant growth from the same period of last year. We were able to meet strong customer demand despite ongoing pressures throughout the supply chain. Raw material shortages, production constraints, and pressures across modes of transportation are creating a difficult supply chain environment. That being said, our performance would not be possible without the cross-functional efforts by our supply chain, merchandising store, and [Indiscernible] teams as we continue to flow record volumes of goods week after week. Over the course of the pandemic, you've heard us talk about a number of initiatives we've implemented. Many in concert with our suppliers to improve our in-stock positions and get product to our customers. And our teams continue to use our culture and values to guide our decisions. One of our values is entrepreneurial spirit, which is alive and well at The Home Depot. Our supply chain teams recently leveraged our scale and flexibility to arrange for several container vessels for our exclusive use. Yet another way our teams found a creative solution to better serve our customers in this dynamic environment. Our in-stock levels are still not where we want them to be, we are maintaining the improvements we made over the last few quarters and building depth in key categories, as evidenced by inventory growing faster than sales compared to the same period last year. Turning to our comp performance. During the second quarter, 10 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps; led by kitchen and bath, and lumber. During the second quarter of this year, we saw single-digit negative comps in paint, hardware, and indoor and outdoor garden. It is important to note that these were some of our strongest performing departments during the second quarter of last year. On a two-year stock basis, each of our departments posted healthy double-digit comps. Our comp average ticket increased 11.3% and comp transactions decreased 6%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven in part by inflation in certain categories, notably lumber. On a 2-year stock basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive. This was another historic quarter for lumber price volatility. During the first few weeks of the second quarter, prices for both framing and panel lumber reached all-time highs before quickly falling from their peaks. As an example, during the second quarter, framing lumber peaked at approximately $1500 per thousand board feet before falling over $1,000 to approximately $500. While pricing for both framing and panel has come down from the peaks, the average price during the second quarter was still significantly higher in the same period last year. Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 420 basis points during the second quarter. Big-ticket comp transactions are those over $1,000 were up approximately 24% compared to the Second Quarter of last year. We saw big ticket -- ticket strength across many Pro-heavy categories, like lumber, vinyl plank flooring, gypsum and pipe and fittings. During the Second Quarter, Pro sales growth outpaced DIY growth for the Second Quarter in a row on a two-year stock basis. Growth with our Pro and DIY customers was consistent and strong. We're encouraged by the momentum we are seeing with our Pros. Growth with our larger Pros continues to outpace that of our smaller Pros, and they tell us that their backlogs are long and growing. In fact, the National Association of Homebuilders remodeling index, hit all-time highs during the second quarter. And during the quarter, we saw many of our customers turned to Pros to help them with larger renovation projects. This can be seen in the strength of several of our kitchen and bath categories, like in-stock kitchens, tubs and showers, and vanities, all of which posted 1-year and 2-year comps above the Company average. Sales leveraging our digital platforms were essentially flat during the second quarter, as we lapped digital sales growth of approximately 100% in the second quarter of last year. On a 2-year stack basis, sales from our digital platforms increased approximately 100%. We're thrilled with the customer engagement across our interconnected platforms. We know the vast majority of our customers engage with us in an interconnected manner. Whether it be through project, inspiration, and research, transacting, fulfillment, or support; our customers blend physical and digital worlds. And while customers have gotten more comfortable buying online, we've never been more confident in the importance of our physical stores as they remain the center of our customer experience due to the project nature of our business. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the second quarter, more than 55% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores; a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. As we look forward to the back half of the year, we know our Pros are busy, and we are working hard to secure the best products to help our Pros get their jobs done. Last quarter, we highlighted several exclusive products for our Pro customers. This quarter we're excited to announce a new Big Box Home Improvement exclusive relationship with LP Building Solutions, a top provider of OSB panel boards. In addition, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing with our Pro Xtra Loyalty Program. Several quarters ago, we relaunched Pro Xtra and we've been thrilled with the membership take-up in engagement we are seeing. Pro Xtra offers more frequent touchpoints with our Pro s inconvenient services like purchase tracking and volume pricing, along with other benefits. In addition, all Pro Xtra members are now able to access our B2B Pro online experience, offering Pros more personalization on homedepot.com. During the third quarter, we are also thrilled to announce the roll-out of what we believe is the most innovative paint offering in years, through our exclusive relationship with Behr. BEHR DYNASTY is a brand new, 4-in-1 interior paint that offers DIY-ers, Pro Painters, and design professionals a unique product exclusively from The Home Depot. It is our most stain repellant, scuff resistant, fast drying, one coat coverage paint, all in one can. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Ted. And good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, total sales were $41.1 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion or 8.1% from last year. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted total sales growth by approximately $385 million. During the second quarter our total Company comps were positive 4.5% with positive comps in all 3 months. During the quarter, we saw total Company comps of 4.7% in May, 3.9% in June, and 4.9% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 3.4% for the quarter, with comps of 3.1% in May, 2.7% in June, and 4.3% in July. In the Second Quarter, our gross margin was 33.2%, a decrease of approximately 80 basis points from the same period last year. While there are many factors that impact gross margin, the year-over-year change during the Second Quarter was primarily driven by lumber, which accounted for approximately 60 basis points of pressure. In addition, several other factors negatively impacted our gross margin, including rising transportation costs, One Supply Chain investments, and lapping a benefit from canceled events in the second quarter of last year. During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 100 basis points to 17.1%. Our operating leverage during the second quarter, reflects significant COVID-related expenses that we incurred in the second quarter of 2020 to support our associates. These expenses were partially offset by underspend and other expense items in the Second Quarter of last year, most notably payroll, as we staffed up to meet the strong demand. Our operating expenses during the Second Quarter of this year also include wage investments that we made at the end of 2020. Our operating margin for the Second Quarter was 16.1%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from the Second Quarter of 2020. Interest and other expense for the second quarter decreased by $16 million to $321 million. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9% down from 24.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.53, an increase of 12.7% compared to the second quarter of 2020. At the end of the quarter, inventories were $18.9 billion up $5.4 billion from last year, and inventory turns were 5.7 times compared with 6.1 times this time last year. Turning to capital allocation, after investing in our business is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the Second Quarter, we invested approximately $520 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $1.75 billion in dividends to our shareholders. And we returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 44.7%, up from 41.1% in the second quarter of Fiscal 2020. As you heard from Craig, we're very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the second quarter, particularly as we lap the unprecedented growth, we saw this time last year. And while these challenging compares continue to the back half of the year, we are encouraged by what we are seeing. During the first 2 weeks of August. we've seen comps in the U.S. consistent with the Second Quarter. Customer engagement and demand for home improvement is healthy. Housing remains strong, and we see a supportive environment for home improvement spending as we look out over the next several years. That said, there's still a significant amount of uncertainty in the broader environment as it relates to the evolution of the COVID -19 pandemic and the new and spreading variants. As we've previously shared, we do not believe we can accurately predict how the external environment will evolve and how it will ultimately impact consumer spending. We will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what has driven our successful performance. Longer-term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning formula for our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement, we intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider, and we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. If we do these things, we believe we will continue to grow faster than our market, and we'll deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Christine, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, [Operator Instructions] One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks, everyone. Good morning.\nCraig Menear: Morning.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi, Craig, Hi, Richard. I wanted to ask -- maybe I'll ask this every quarter for now. I wanted to ask about Home Improvement demand, whether it has to digest the next couple of years or we can keep compounding. And I think Richard just mentioned in his comments, expecting several years of healthy demand ahead. Curious if your thoughts have evolved on the next couple of years, given the massive growth we've had over the past 2.\nCraig Menear: Simeon, when we look at the overall backdrop for support and Home Improvement from a housing perspective, from the re-modeling index, we feel pretty good about the long-term outlook for Home Improvement. Hard to predict the short-term, but the longer-term outlook looks solid. Richard I don't know if you want to.\nRichard McPhail: You just -- you look at the -- we have believed that home price appreciation is a fundamental support of home Improvement activity in demand. As your home becomes more valuable, you are more likely to spend more on it. We are at a point now where the housing stock of the U.S. is over 20% more valuable than it was 2 years ago. As we -- as we look forward, not only have we seen that home price appreciation, but the homeowner balance sheet is incredibly healthy. The state of mortgage finance is incredibly healthy and so that's why some of the reasons why we're optimistic.\nSimeon Gutman: That's helpful and then one near-term question, the second-half outlook for gross margin. There's this dynamic that occurred in the second quarter, does it ease allowing the gross margin to improve in the back half -- well, not improved, but at least the rate of change improve from what happened in the second quarter?\nRichard McPhail: I'd say we're focused on executing week-to-week here. There are certainly cost pressures in the environment and I think we're all dealing with that. But we've dealt with that throughout our history and we're comfortable with our ability to manage through the cost environment effectively.\nCraig Menear: Simeon, I think there are some very unique scenarios obviously in the quarter, lumber being the one as Richard called out. Unprecedented level of drop and unprecedented speed with which it drops. Normally the only impact you have is from mix. But with the rapid decline in the extent of the decline, we always have a philosophy that we want to lead the market down and lag going up, to remain as competitive as possible for our customers. And that actually created an impact, which, in this quarter, was unique, that we normally don't see.\nCraig Menear: And I'd make another comment which is the shape of the business given the volume that is coming through our system is not predictable, but we know we're confident that we are taking share and we're there to meet the demand that we see from our customer. That mix may have an impact but when we look at the operating profit dollar growth we're generating as a Company, we feel great about it. We're looking more at driving market share capture and driving that operating profit dollar growth.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS, please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question.\nCraig Menear: Morning.\nMichael Lasser: How should the trend that you outlined with diversion performance on the weekdays versus the weekends inform how we think about the DIY business moving forward. Do you attribute that to more of a temporary condition, where consumers had pent-up demand to go on vacation this summer, and they'll return to projects in the fall, or alternatively, as families return to traditional activities like [Indiscernible] sports, watching College and Pro sports, and gradually returning the office, it's going to put accelerating pressure on the DIY business. And do you think there's enough strength and pent-up demand for the Pro segment that it can offset that?\nCraig Menear: Hey, Michael. It's a great question and something we're watching carefully as the consumer gets back to more normal environment. What we did see is the consumers, and our research would suggest this as well, consumers are taking on more projects. They have larger projects and have a tendency to hire a pro to do them. And as a result, we've seen our Pro-business strengthen for several quarters in a row with the last 2 quarters where the Pro outperformed the DIY customers for the first time since the pandemic started. And so we're very optimistic about where the Pro business goes and the strength of that Pro business. And we're focused on making sure that we can take care of those Pros along with our DIY customers, but I feel like there is solid opportunity to continue to grow. Pros tell us their backlogs are bigger than ever. Consumers continue to tell us the home is more important than ever, and that they have a laundry list of projects.\nMichael Lasser: That's all helpful, Craig and you're gonna have this funky dynamic where maybe the Pro business is good, maybe the DIY business decelerates from here. And how is that going to impact your labor motto, which is activity-based? So if comps do turn negative in the back half, how quickly can you flex that, and how well is it fine-tuned for this dynamic where you might have a decline in DIY transactions that you may actually not need as much labor so you can save some SG&A dollars on that.\nCraig Menear: Michael, you hit it on the head in terms of our labor model is an activity-based model, which has a component in there of transaction. We can adjust relatively quickly. It's a short-cycle model, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments as we go. It's a -- we plan out a few weeks in advance.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. Thank you very much and good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Hey, good morning. I just wanted you guys to elaborate a little bit more on some of the benefits you expect to see once the One HD Supply Chain gets built out sometime in 2022?\nTed Decker: Sure, the whole purposes of the supply chain is really our ability to deliver all of our products, parcel and big and bulky, to 90% of the U.S. population same and next day. And we're 3 plus years into this build-out. We have multiple facilities up of each type that we're building. They're all performing well in fulfilling that expectation of being able to deliver and satisfy the customers. Speed and reliability is what's required, particularly with our Pro customers. In addition, its allowing us to expand our assortments from what we carry in our stores. So not only can we get the product in a quicker, more reliable fashion to our customers. We can get a broader assortment to our customers. And lastly, we're up to $660 a square foot of sales this past quarter in our stores. And it's just a tremendous amount of activity in cubing that building. So to be able to get deliveries, particularly the big and bulky deliveries out of the store, that helps our customer flow and our associate activities in the store. And we're just thrilled with that in particular. Our FDCs have opened up. We're relieving tremendous amount of delivery activity in cube flow out of our stores, in delivering directly out of the new facilities exactly the way the Supply Chain Team has planned it.\nChuck Grom: That's great. And then just on lumber, I'm curious what you're seeing from a unit volume perspective as prices dropped throughout the quarter.\nTed Decker: Well, clearly, when we hit $1,500 plus of 1,000 board feet, people backed out of the market for sure and waited. And it wasn't till we got a tremendous amount of new supply in the marketplace. I think once you hit that tipping point where people backed off on the margin and prices started to fall, and as Craig said, it was falling so quickly. $100, $150 even $200 a 1,000 board feet per week. People just step back even further. That's now settled at about $430 for framing lumber. And for sure, at those high levels, we saw an impact units. Our units had turned negative. And as prices have come down, units are still negative, but on a sequential basis, improving in responding to that lower price. So we're very pleased, supply and demand dynamics worked as expected.\nChuck Grom: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays, please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much. Just wondering, with respect to inventory. You're up against your comparisons from last year, but looking at overall areas of inventory, is there any area where you think you're still lacking product? And then how to think about inventory growth in the second half of the year?\nCraig Menear: First of all, Karen, I'd say we're super pleased that we've been able to continue to build up but yet at the same time have incredible inventory productivity at 5.7 turns. So we're very, very pleased with that. There's still -- we're in a situation still where we're not exactly where we want to be from an in-stock perspective. Our suppliers are working hard, but our merchants have worked with our suppliers to narrow the focus on key SKUs. And so there's opportunity still, to continue to bring more product in across the breadth of the assortment. But right now we are trying to stay focused on the things that really, really matter.\nTed Decker: And I'd say, it's been a category-by-category story. And as Craig said, we're trying to build depth in our highest velocity SKUs. We're trying to build depth in job lot quantities for our Pro customers. And that tends to be heavy on the building material side of the business, lumber building materials, and electrical, and plumbing, fixtures. And we've recovered nicely in all of those departments, but again, it can be category by category. There's a COVID outbreak in a factory, there's a shipping constraint, there's a domestic transportation capacity constraint. So it's been the story of two steps forward, one step back, but we are making progress. And that's why we're happy to lean into inventory. We're blessed with the financial strength and liquidity. Our goods tend to be non-perishable, not a lot of obsolescence particularly in our core product. So if -- and a lot of this is who has the product, who's going to sell the product, and I think our supply chain and merchants responding as well as they have, is one of the reasons we've taken so much market share in this environment.\nKaren Short: Okay. That's helpful and I just was wondering on the Pro Xtra loyalty. I was wondering if you'd be willing to give a little update on the number of members in the program. And then any color, if you can provide, on average spend of members versus the non-member pro or just any metrics that you could provide.\nTed Decker: Yeah. Won't get into details. But, you know our rough dynamic, about 4% or 5% of our customer base being the Pro makes up 45% of our sales, so this is a number in the mid-millions of our core Pros. Very strong number of those, percentage of those are in the Pro Xtra program. And now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're building a B2B website and all of our Pro Xtra members now have been transferred over to that B2B experience. So with the combination of the benefits that you're getting with Pro Xtra we've stood up a separate Pro Xtra app that those Pros are using, and the ability to engage on the B2B website which has all sorts of functionality build-out specifically for the Pro. So think of builds, and material for jobs, tracking jobs, quotes, building quotes, reorder capability, tracking all receipts, preferred pricing in certain instances. All of that is coming together as well as personalization in building relevance on that Pro B2B website so think of something like search results. If you or I would put in flyers, We have thousands of pliers that could be returned in that search result. We're getting to the point now that we know an electrician is performing that search so we're going to provide relevance, and we're going to provide our electrical pliers as the first results in that search query. So this is just another great add to our Pro ecosystem and just been tremendous engagement with the Pro Loyalty app, the Pro Xtra program, and now B2B website.\nKaren Short: Great, thanks very much for all the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer, please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nagel: Good morning.\nCraig Menear: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel: Thank you for taking my question. A couple of questions with regards to sales, and pretty quick ones. First off, just with respect to lumber, I know you talked about it in your prepared comments and in response from the questions, but could you say to what extent lumber was a benefit to comps this quarter?\nCraig Menear: About 1.3 billion.\nBrian Nagel: Okay. And that was way more towards the first, the way you've laid it out, we've got -- sales weighed much more towards the first half of the quarter. Or for -- early in the quarter, I guess, we'd better say that.\nCraig Menear: Yes, Brian, for sure. It was a unbelievable fast fall. But yes, it was -- that was heavily geared towards the 1st part of the quarter.\nBrian Nagel: Okay. And then the 2nd question I have, and I know this is awful nuanced, but you talked about the strength in the Pro business in your conversations, your connections with your Pro customers. Do you think that the jobs are being taken on now? Were those jobs that were started during the pandemic and are only now being able to be fulfilled because the Pros have -- Pros are available to work or are these projects are actually starting right now?\nCraig Menear: I think you've probably have a combination, would be my best guess. I don't know that for sure, but we know, for example, when we talk to Pros, that they've had a backlog for some time. And so I think, clearly, there's probably some that have been in the works where they've been waiting to -- a customer has been waiting for a Pro to start a job and then I think there's probably scenarios where it's a quicker cycle but we don't really have a way of knowing that\nRichard McPhail: The National Association of Homebuilders index has a lot of interesting survey data within it. One of the survey components is consumer optimism and intent around proJects. And we have actually seen intent, check-up for small projects, medium-sized projects, and large projects, really sort of sequentially through the year. So I think if you take the question off of the backlog and you say, what's the intent, it does seem that homeowners are leaning into projects. And you know, whether it's a Pro or consumer customer, at all eventually is the same customer demand. So it looks like the trend is strengthening in project demand.\nTed Decker: And I think if you look at our services, businesses, or proxy, we're certainly seeing that as well as our service business think of these are large projects, carpet installation, cabinet installation, re-phased, and bath, HVAC. Those all are strong and accelerating.\nBrian Nagel: I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. You're lapping a period of very low promotional activity, as you know, and given the 3 major holiday events in Q2 with Memorial Day, Father's Day, July 4th, could you talk about to what extent these events were a material topline driver in the quarter? And then, with respect to gross margin, to what extent did this have an impact in Q2, and how should we think about the promotional impact as that mixes into the gross margin line in the second half.\nCraig Menear: I would say our promotions were up from last year, but only because we canceled so many last year, we were on the margin less promotional say than going back to '19. So while we're very happy with our events in our sell-through, we had record sell-through in virtually all of our programs. The events were not a huge driver of our comp and it wasn't -- the things Richard called out on our margin impact, it wasn't particularly meaningful.\nRichard McPhail: It wasn't meaningful.\nZach Fadem: Got it. That's helpful. And then Richard, could you talk about how your Pro versus DIY trends performed through the quarter. And if there was any variability in trend from one versus the other. And then for Q3, does the commentary that trends are in line during the first 2 weeks of August, does that also hold for both Pro versus DIY?\nRichard McPhail: Well, so we're not gonna break out intra -quarter. It was the second quarter where we saw our Pro customer grow faster than our DIY customer. I'd say in the 1st 2 weeks of the quarter, not much has changed with respect to the direction of our business.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Appreciate the time.\nCraig Menear: Welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nLiz Suzuki: Great, thank you. Could you just give an update on the MRO market and the trends you're seeing there? And you mentioned that your big Pros we're outpacing small Pros so was MRO growth even above that of those big Pros given relatively easier comparisons against last year?\nCraig Menear: Liz, we're very pleased actually with our MRO business and the acquisition of HD Supply. The business there is very solid. What we're excited about, candidly, with that business, is the opportunity to much better serve 50 million households in the multi-family space. Not only can we serve them with MRO products, but obviously as we have relationships and build that through our MRO business, the opportunity to then participate in capital refreshes for those property owners on those 50 million households that are in the multi-family, is a huge opportunity for Home Depot going forward. So we're super pleased with the business and the progress that we're making there.\nLiz Suzuki: Wait, and I'm just checking in to Zach's question a little bit. I mean, it may be early to be thinking about this, but how are you approaching the holiday season this year from a procurement standpoint and a promotional standpoint? Should we expect it to look more like last year where marketing started early and extended longer, but the promotions were a bit shallower than a normal year or do you think it will go back to a shorter and deeper promotional cadence like pre-pandemic seasons?\nCraig Menear: Well, as you can imagine, with the international supply chain involved in those type events, the merchants and supply chain teams made the bulk of those buy decision sometime ago. So it's a fixed buy, We're not expecting huge growth in those programs. But to your point, it's deeper buys, stronger values, fewer items, and we think we have great programs. In terms of marketing early, I think we're going to follow all our normal trends. We had a sneak peek with opening up Halloween online and just sold out of our pre-release Halloween product almost immediately. That's a very strong indication that people are still going to engage in decorating, and we look forward to setting our decorative holiday later in October.\nLiz Suzuki: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan, please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. It's been a long time since the weather was a potential question, but during the second quarter, do you think it was a net headwind the major DIY holidays had record rain in some of the Northern geographies. And so was it beyond just the bathtub effect of 1Q versus 2Q?\nRichard McPhail: I wouldn't say it was beyond it, but we certainly saw it. So we think that it may have accounted for low single-digit comp impact, call it 100 to 200 basis points of comp of pull-forward from Q1, I'm sorry, from Q2 into Q1 particularly in the Northern division. As Craig called out, while we did see a difference in divisional performance, that really was the primary driver in our view.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then on the lumber side, as prices stand now, would lumber be a modest headwind comp for the balance of the year and is that reflected in the quarter-to-date commentary?\nRichard McPhail: Yeah. Lumber just the market pricing of lumber, Chris, right now, framing is approaching 40% under LY, and panel is 10% under LY. With neutral units, there would be a negative comp impact. As I said, unit progression is going in the right direction with these lower prices and that all speaks to the project nature, but from a price perspective, not expecting any tailwind in lumber.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then the last question, Richard, is as you think about how transportation costs and I assume some of that gets hung up in inventory, so do you think the transportation cost pressure actually gets worse as you look in the back half? So as much as the re-pressure from lumber doesn't repeat itself, you could have higher transportation cost pressures on gross margin.\nRichard McPhail: The back half is a long period of time. I'm not going to speculate on what transportation costs might look like. I will just tell you that I would bet on our team every single day to be able to manage through that dynamic. Our supply chain team is exceptional and creative. And I think that they have reinforced our position as the low-cost provider in the market. So regardless of where the market goes. I think we'll be in an advantaged position.\nChristopher Horvers: I'm sorry. One last quick one. In July, how would you characterize the competitive promotional environment? There are some questions out there that maybe some of your competitors got more promotional, although it was for you just more of a comparison to a low level last year?\nCraig Menear: I didn't see anything majorly different.\nRichard McPhail: I didn't notice that much. Chris.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Thanks so much. Best of luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs, please proceed with your question.\nKate McShane: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of housekeeping-type questions. I wondered if you could address, at all, the trend of trading up by the customer, if that was something you continued to see during the quarter? And any commentary you can give, specifically around appliances and what you saw in Q2?\nTed Decker: I would say yes, we continue to see the trading up. It's not as clear as I used to report on it just because of the inventory situation or we're seeing lots of substitution of goods depending on what's in stock on the shelf that particular day. But if you look at power tools, for example, outdoor power equipment, the appliance category, grill category, riding lawnmower, and zero-turn categories, just as a few examples, Kate, people are trading up to innovation in all those categories. More powerful, longer run time on batteries, that's moving over to outdoor power equipment. The design aesthetic, and the features of modern appliances. People are happily trading up to quite strong price points in appliances. LED lighting, it's going through not just light bulbs but integrated into ceiling fans and fixtures. That trade-up is innovation and newness driven, and we're seeing that as strong as ever.\nOperator: Does that complete your question?\nKate McShane: Yes. Sorry. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. I had a follow-up on comps and then SGNA. I guess I'd start with SGNA. So you had 100 bps of leverage in the first half. And you guys had talked about getting back to leveraging the way that Home Depot did in the past. Should we expect the second half to have similar type leverage or is there something unique about what happened last year that means that would be less?\nCraig Menear: Well, Greg, 2020 was such a unique year and comparisons from 2021 to 2020 are difficult for a number of factors. You think about the amount of COVID expense that we put in place in support of our associates last year. You think about expense underspend as we worked to bring staffing up to levels to meet demand. And then you think about the wage investment that we made towards the end of 2020. All these make comparisons difficult. We are committed to generating operating expense leverage over the long term. We feel great about the operating expense leverage that we've delivered in Q2 and in the first half. You're always going to see fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.  Leverage is a function of topline sales, it can be a function of seasonality and other factors. In any given quarter, you may see volatility, but over a period of quarters, you're going to see from us operating expense leverage. And again, we're very happy with how the quarter and a half played out.\nGreg Melich: And my follow-up, maybe linked to that is on comps. If the trend, I just want to make sure I got it right. If the trend is similar in the Second Quarter but there is no inflation in lumber, is it fair to say that that 2-year comp is stable on the mid-20s without inflation? Am I interpreting that correct?\nCraig Menear: Well, two-year comp is similar in its consistency to one-year comp in the first couple of weeks of the month.\nGreg Melich: Got it. Right. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot and good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research, please proceed with your question. Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask in regards to supply chain. You alluded in the prepared comments working through a difficult environment. Are you seeing incremental pressures now versus just a few months ago? Is there is some level of sales that you missed out on in the Q2 period? And maybe a bigger-picture question, through all the recent supply chain issues across the industry, is there anything now that you're re-evaluating or making some type of change within the One Home Depot build-out?\nCraig Menear: I'd say the first comment that I'd have is as it relates to the potential sales impact, really, really hard to tell. And the reason that's so hard to get a gauge on that is the fact that there is a high level of willingness of substitution on the customer's parts since this pandemic began, much more so than pre-pandemic. Is there some level of impact? The logic tells you there probably was, but it's really hard to gauge and we think we captured most as a result of substitution.\nDavid Bellinger: And any change in regard to your larger build-out plans of One Home Depot?\nCraig Menear: No, not at all. No. We're -- that build-out -- I'm sorry, that build-out is focused on where the customer 's taken us, and how they want to engage with The Home Depot, so it has no impact at all.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. And just my follow-up here, you mentioned a new exclusive relationship with LP Building Solutions. Can you expand upon that any further? Does that reflect some type of shift in the business where maybe you lean more into Pros tied to more new home construction as the next level of Pro sales growth and just give the Company more exposure on the new home construction side. Can you just expand upon that any further?\nCraig Menear: No. I mean, the intent was not to be any different position in regards to new home construction. It's not a market we play in or consciously go after. LP is similar to what we did last quarter with Carlon electrical boxes. There is -- as Carlon is the largest provider, particularly for the Pro, in PVC electrical boxes, LP is one of the top couple OSB providers, a very strong brand. And this is a matter of the Home Depot making arrangements with top suppliers so that they can focus their supply chain into serving us, and we can focus on having that depth of inventory in these critical Pro categories on our shelves, so that the likes of exclusives with Carlon and LP is all about taking care of our Pro customer.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nLaura Champine: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get some context around the commentary that you should be able to lap the difficult comparisons given the strong macro drivers and home prices, and comparing that to the outcome in Q2 of transactions that were down. Is the thought there that the transactions were down largely because of lumber inflation and other sort of onetime issues. And the transaction should tick back up as we move through the rest of this year and next?\nCraig Menear: Well, our first comment would be we didn't really provide any outlook going forward. We don't believe we can take past performance and project that forward due to the uncertainty in the environment that exists today. As it relates to the transactions, I mean, huge transactions last year as a result of PPE. Ted, if you want to comment.\nTed Decker: Yeah. I mean, that was one of our single biggest drivers of the fall-off. Is people coming in for masks and hand sanitizers. And of the four departments that we did see negative sales, hardware, outdoor and indoor gardening paint, those are can tend to be more consumer-oriented. Lots of units and mulch and soil and things and paint is a DIYer was home, not doing other activities on the weekend. We're not alarmed by that fall-off at all. We'll get through that. I'd say that take a category like paint, paint had been a 1 or 2 unit grower for several years up until the pandemic. And painting is one of the initial home improvement projects that a customer engages in and starts to build confidence in home improvement. In while we saw a dip in Q2, the levels in unit volume that we're seeing in paint is well above 2019, and I've talked about the millennials before. Millennials are engaged in housing. They are engaging in home improvement. They've done that first project which is painting and some gardening work, generally. So we're just thrilled that they are engaged in the category, and moving on to bigger projects.\nLaura Champine: Got it. And then as a follow-on, do we have a better sense now on where digital should be in terms of longer-term sustainable growth rate and/or the percentage of sales? Hopefully, things are settling out there.\nCraig Menear: I mean, we really look at this as an interconnected experience. Our customers are clearly blending the physical and digital worlds together because of the project nature of our business.  Certainly from pre-pandemic levels, we've seen an accelerated rate of engagement in terms of sales through our digital channels, but that's not how we focus on that or look at it. We view it as a capability for our customer to engage with the Home Depot.\nLaura Champine: All right, thank you.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Bosshard: Thanks. Two things. First of all, perhaps for Richard, some clarity on lumber. You talked about leading on the way down with price to do what's best for the customer. Does that necessitate more gross margin pressure from lumber in 3Q or am I thinking about that wrong?\nCraig Menear: By and large, the pressure from lumber, at least what the prices we've seen in the market has been recognized to date, so no. And now it depends on future lumber price. But at the moment, the precipitous decline had its impact in Q2 for the most part.\nRichard McPhail: Yeah. Eric, the key for that, normally, you don't see any pressure from gross margin as a result of lumber. It's all because of mix. The reason we saw it this time was the steep decline that happened in price in a very compressed timeframe. And again, we weren't going to change our approach to the market. We want to be incredibly focused on driving the best value for our customer. We always try to lag the market when it's going up and lead it when it's coming down.\nEric Bosshard: Perfect. That makes sense. And then secondly, the sales growth over the last couple of years now is exceptional, as you pointed out. You've obviously invested to take care of your associates and take care of your customers. The margin leverage has been less than what we would have expected, with nearly a $50 billion, 50% increase in sales in the last three years. Is there some embedded operating margin improvement that can get released over the next couple of years if things return to normal or is the cost of doing business and other investments you've made, taken some of that away?  Trying to figure out if the operating margin of the enterprise can lift incrementally in the next couple of years or if more of the focus is on sales growth and a little bit less on releasing operating margin.\nRichard McPhail: I think so. I think that we have to go back to the central focus that we have from a financial performance perspective, which is growing operating profit dollars as fast as possible and generating an exceptional return on investment on those dollars. And so we feel very pleased with the market share that we've captured over the last 3 to 4 years, and we feel exceptionally pleased with the shareholder value that we've created as well. We think that the formula of having the best experience in home improvement retail, being the lowest cost provider and being the best investor of capital in the market is a formula that can't be beaten, and that's what we're going to continue to do.\nEric Bosshard: Great. Thank you very much.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Ms. Janci, I'd now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thanks, Christine. And thank you, everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our Third Quarter Earnings call in November.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-05-18 13:49:10", "content": "Operator: Greetings.

Now let me turn the call over to Craig.\nCraig Menear: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning. Fiscal 2021 is off to a strong start, as we grew the business by over $9 billion compared to the first quarter of last year. Sales for the first quarter were $37.5 billion, up 32.7% from last year. Comp sales were up 31% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 29.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.86 in the first quarter, up from $2.08 in the first quarter last year. Our results this quarter were once again driven by broad-based strength across the business and geographies. All of our top 40 markets posted double-digit comps, while Canada posted comps above the company average and Mexico posted double-digit comps. Both ticket and transactions were up double digits in the quarter, and as Ted will detail, we saw strong double-digit growth from both our Pro and DIY customers. We continue to effectively manage the outsized demand for home improvement products seen throughout most of the last year despite disruptions in global supply chains that were further exasperated by port congestion during the quarter. We leveraged the scale of our supply chain and partnered with our vendors to maintain our in-stock positions and prioritized key SKUs in high demand categories. While we continue to see strong level of engagement across our digital platforms we saw more of our customers return to our stores. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 27% versus the first quarter last year and approximately 55% of online orders were fulfilled through a store. We continue to rollout new capabilities, such as mixed cart selling from store that remove friction for both our customers and associates. The mix cart feature enables associates to more efficiently and effectively serve the total project needs for a customer, as products from both the website and store can be added to a single transaction. We also continue to drive interconnected enhancements in other areas of the business to solve customer pain points. In tool rental, for example, we will soon expand our rent online pilot chain wide enabling rent online, pickup in store capabilities for all 1,300 plus tool rental locations in the U.S. and Canada. This will enhance the experience for our busy Pro and DIY customers and complement additional investments we\u2019re making to expand our rental footprint and increase our assortment and delivery capabilities. We are focused on continuing to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance the interconnected shopping experience. Our efforts will continue to support what we believe is our winning formula, deliver the best shopping experience and home improvement, extend our position as a low cost provider with a relentless focus on productivity and be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. We believe this strategy will help us deliver returns by driving growth faster than the market in any environment. The build out of our One Home Depot supply chain vision is a wonderful example of our strategy and action. Enhanced fulfilment capabilities will not only create a better customer experience, but they will also expand the breadth of our current opportunities set from both a product and customer standpoint. The ability to combine this growth potential with scale to create the low cost network and home improvement is a formula that we believe delivers long-term value creation for our customers, supplier partners and shareholders. During the quarter, we continue to build out our One Supply Chain vision by opening several new facilities and we\u2019re very excited with the progress we continue to make on this key strategic priority. We have now been operating in this unprecedented demand environment for over a year and continue to align around a few key learnings. First, the investments we have made in the business over the past decade were the right ones, and second, they have enabled agility and flexibility to execute on critical business decisions in a challenging and dynamic operating environment. As a result, we have managed unprecedented levels of web traffic, record levels of product flow through our supply chain, all while improving customer service levels in our stores. These factors coupled with our world class associates and strong partnerships with suppliers have enabled us to meet outsized demand week-after-week. Our culture has remained our Northstar, as our decisions are anchored to some of our most important values, do the right thing and take care of our people. Our ability to continue investing for the future, while also managing the most fluid environment in our company\u2019s history is a direct result of our associates and their extraordinary efforts. I want to close by thanking them for the many ways they continue to live our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during these challenging times. With that, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their commitment to serving our customers and communities. We continue to experience unprecedented levels of demand during the first quarter, with comps accelerating to more than 30% when compared to the first quarter of last year. This elevated demand and transportation headwinds are pressuring parts of the supply chain. But our teams continue to work together with their supplier partners to manage through these pressures. Moving to our comp performance during the first quarter, 13 of our 14 merchandising departments posted comps at or above 20%, led by our lumber and kitchen and bath departments. Our comp average ticket increased 10.3% and comp transactions increased 19.1%. Similar to what we reported in our previous three quarters, the growth in our comp average ticket was driven by elevated project demand, customers trading up to new and innovative products, and continued inflation in many product categories, including lumber. This was another record setting quarter for lumber prices. Let me give you an example of what that means for one of our core lumber SKUs. At the end of the first quarter last year, a sheet of 7/16 OSB was approximately $9.55. As we exited the first quarter this year, that same sheet of OSB more than quadrupled in price to $39.76. Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 375 basis points during the first quarter. Our interconnected retail strategy is resonating with our customers, as evidenced by strong growth from both in-store and online transactions, and we are pleased with our ability to meet widespread demand across our selling platforms. As you heard from Craig, sales from our digital channels grew by 27% during the first quarter, which equates to more than 100% growth on a two-year stack basis. Big ticket comp transactions are those over $1,000 were up approximately 50% compared to the first quarter of last year, we saw widespread big ticket strength across our business, with notable outperformance in lumber, vinyl plank flooring and many of our installation services. From a customer standpoint, we saw double-digit growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. Growth with both customer groups accelerated during the first quarter with Pro sales growth slightly outpacing DIY. Sales to our Pro customers continue to strengthen, posting the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth and the best quarterly growth rate on record. Pros continue to tell us that project demand is strong and their backlogs are growing. Shifting over to our DIY customers, the strong demand we saw during the back half of last year continued during the first quarter. From gardening to garage and organization, new and existing customers are engaging with home improvement and during the quarter we were also well-positioned for the start of the spring selling season. We took decisive action earlier than usual to proactively lean into our inventory position. This paid off as spring began breaking across the country and our associates were well-equipped to serve as customers across key outdoor and garden categories, and the strength in gardening was more than just plants and shrubs. We posted a record quarter in categories like planters and hardscapes. Additionally, while outdoor categories exhibited significant growth during the first quarter, we\u2019ve continued to see strong momentum with interior projects around the house. Interior projects like countertops, vanities, blinds and home d\u00e9cor, all showed significant growth in the first quarter. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are focused on continuing the momentum we\u2019re seeing with our customers. We\u2019re particularly encouraged with a strong demand we\u2019re seeing from our Pro customers. And for our Pros, we know that brands matter. Brands like Milwaukee, Klein and Car Lawn [ph] have significant market share in their respective categories and are trusted by our Pro customers to get the job done. The Milwaukee recently expanded their powerful M18 battery platform to include a full line of cordless nailers that deliver pneumatic performance with no compressors, no gas cartridges and rapid fire rates to keep Pros productive. The M18 platform now features over 200 tools that are exclusive to The Home Depot in the Big Box Home Improvement channel. And at a time when Pros are busier than ever, we\u2019re thrilled that we\u2019re the destination for Car Lawns PVC electrical boxes in Klein tools. These brands are two of the most widely used by electricians. We\u2019ve enjoyed a long exclusive partnership with Klein being first to market with their new and innovative products and we are now the exclusive national partner of Car Lawn in the Big Box Home Improvement channel. While we don\u2019t know how the demand environment will ultimately unfold, as we look forward to the rest of the busy spring season, we feel great about our position and we look forward to serving our customers both in-store and online. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, total sales were $37.5 billion, an increase of $9.2 billion or 32.7% from last year. During the first quarter, our total company comps were positive 31%, with positive comps of 19.8% in February, 36.2% in March and 34.3% in April. Comps in the U.S. were positive 29.9% for the quarter, with positive comps of 19.9% in February, 35.6% in March and 32% in April. During the first quarter, all 19 of our U.S. regions, as well as Canada and Mexico posted strong double-digit comps. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34%, a decrease of approximately 10 basis points from last year. Mixed pressure from higher lumber sales alone negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately 35 basis points. During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 390 basis points to 18.6%. We were pleased with our operating leverage during the first quarter, as it reflects disciplined expense control, along with a couple of other expense items that I\u2019d like to highlight. First, our operating leverage in the first quarter of this year reflects the impact of several one-time expenses that we incurred in the first quarter of 2020, including additional compensation and benefits to support our associates. These expenses were partially offset by under spend in other expense items in the first quarter of last year, notably payroll as we work to staff up labor to meet the surge in demand. Together, the net impact of these factors resulted in approximately 240 basis points of operating expense leverage during the first quarter of 2021. Second, during the first quarter of 2021, we incurred approximately $80 million of COVID-related expenses, which created approximately 20 basis points of operating expense deleverage. And lastly, our operating expense leverage during the first quarter also includes pressure from higher accrued bonus expense, primarily related to our outperformance for our store success sharing program and store and field-based management bonuses for the first half of fiscal 2021. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 15.4%, compared to 11.6% in the first quarter of 2020. Interest and other expense for the first quarter increased by $26 million to $333 million, due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than one year ago. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9%, down from 24.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $3.86, an increase of 85.6% compared to the first quarter of 2020. During the quarter, we opened one new store in the U.S. and one in Mexico, bringing our total store count to 2,298. Selling square footage at the end of the quarter was 239 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, inventories were $19.2 billion, up $4.2 billion from last year and inventory turns were 5.5 times, up from 5 times last year. Turning to capital allocation, our long-term principles for how we think about deploying capital have not changed. First and foremost, we will invest in our business. During the first quarter we invested approximately $525 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And second, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and repurchasing shares. During the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.8 billion in dividends to our shareholders and we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Our share repurchases during the first quarter partially reflect an elevated cash balance in 2020, when we paused share repurchases to temporarily increase our liquidity levels as we navigated the pandemic. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.1%, up from 40.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Moving to the broader demand environment for home improvement. The strong demand that we\u2019ve seen for more than a year now has continued. During the first two weeks of May, on a two-year stacked basis, we\u2019ve seen comps in the U.S. above 30%. Housing remains strong, homeowners balance sheets are healthy and our customers continue to tell us that they are planning on spending of variety -- on a variety of home improvement projects. With that said, we cannot predict how the external environment will evolve and how it will ultimately impact the consumer. We will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what is driven our successful performance. Our relentless focus on the customer and our ability to remain flexible and agile has enabled us to serve our customers and to meet demand in this dynamic environment. Longer term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning formula for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement. We intend to extend our position as a low cost provider. And we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. If we do these things, we believe we will grow faster than our market and we will deliver exceptional shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi, everyone. My first question is, is there anything that changes your view on housing more or less constructive compared to the underlying assumptions that you built through 2021 plan against?\nCraig Menear: No. Simeon, I\u2019d say, yeah, the housing environment continues to remain very strong. So, it\u2019s only strengthened I think from last year and the current shortage of new housing clearly is helping to drive improvements in the home values, which is a good thing for spending in the home.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then my follow-up is actually more on operating profit and margin. And I think your message is very clear that you\u2019re focused on growing faster than the market, and I think Richard told us last quarter, you\u2019re managing operating profit dollars and margins fall where they fall. Can I ask about the two, I think, about the incremental drivers going forward, it\u2019s about interconnected retail and then somewhat in MRO and Pro, because some of the investments and acquisitions you\u2019ve made? Is there anything about the margin structure of those businesses and incremental growth that would hold back margins?\nRichard McPhail: No. I mean, when we look at the business overall, we interconnected, we manage as a portfolio approach and 55% of the orders are flowing through our stores. And then as it relates to the structure in Pro, we\u2019ve shared in the past and you look at Pro in total, Pro is a very similar margin profile to the DIY customer, when you\u2019re looking at a complete project and so that\u2019s -- yeah, really nothing there that\u2019s dramatically different.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Baker: Hi. Thanks, guys. And I appreciate the fact that, you didn\u2019t really update your outlook and your press release talk to it too much. But I guess, let me ask this, are you -- it seems respected from volume, probably, ahead of where you thought you would be at this point. So is there any update to that idea of if trends continue will be, I think, was what flat to up slightly in margins at about 14%? Can you update that comment that you gave in the first quarter? And I guess related to that, is the right way to think about comps for the quarter and I guess the year somewhere in that 30% to your stacked rate, would that be a fair sort of assumption to model for the rest of the year?\nCraig Menear: Let me share with you. I mean, clearly, the first quarter performance was stronger than what we anticipated. We did not think that we would deliver a 30% comps. And as it relates to the framework that we provided, Richard, you might want to speak to the framework.\nRichard McPhail: Sure. And just to remind everyone, we actually, at the end of the fourth quarter last year, we felt unable to provide an outlook due to level of uncertainty in the environment. So we did not provide an outlook. We did feel that given the significance of non-recurring expenses in 2020, we could provide our view on our margin profile at a hypothetical level of sales. So, looking forward, we continue to believe that the environment and the consumer response to it is difficult to predict. With respect to Q1, we\u2019re very pleased with the operating expense leverage and earnings flow through that we drove. And we\u2019re going to keep operating the business with discipline and keep a focus on driving operating expense leverage.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the commentary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: If we look at your month of May and April, your two-year stacks were running around or even better than 40%, and now you mentioned, May so far is up about 30%. So do you think that we\u2019re starting to see the stimulus impact to your comps dissipate and such that and I know was asked a couple of different ways, but 30% run rate and a two-year stack that could ways to move forward or is it better for us to expect that that 30% two-stack run rate on an arithmetic basis should flow from here?\nCraig Menear: Well, Michael, we just -- we can\u2019t extrapolate results to future periods. It\u2019s just too difficult to predict how the environment might evolve and how the consumer\u2019s response to that might evolve. When you look at the progression from March and April, and you just -- you think about stimulus impact, it\u2019s very difficult to quantify the impact from stimulus. What we do know is that of the $402 billion that the government announced would be paid directly to individuals as part of the American Rescue Plan. Of that $402 billion, $325 billion of it hit bank accounts in March. And so while we can\u2019t quantify the exact impact, it probably did have some sort of impact on that March to April progression.\nRichard McPhail: Michael, I\u2019d say, why we really can\u2019t extrapolate to future periods. The one thing that we\u2019re very encouraged about is when you look at the overall kind of backdrop for home improvement on a longer term basis, we feel very good about that.\nMichael Lasser: If anything do you want to point these specifically, Craig, from a longer term basis that you\u2026\nCraig Menear: Well, when you\u2026\nMichael Lasser: \u2026expect?\nCraig Menear: Mike, when you think about we\u2019re at post-World War II housing availability. So two months of supply versus historical average of six that that situation won\u2019t be resolved in near-term, it\u2019s going to take time for that to be resolved. So I think that supports home values and the continued growth in home values, which we know. As home values grow, people feel good about investing in their home overall. So that alone is, I think, a very positive outlook for home improvement as you move forward.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow up question is, how do you think your market share unfolded in the first quarter from an online perspective, recognizing that you had a very difficult comparison? Do you think you\u2019ve kept pace with the overall market and is this the right run rate for the online growth to think about moving forward?\nCraig Menear: I mean, we -- again, we look at this as a total and run this as a portfolio, because it\u2019s so interconnected. And if you look at the data, it appears that we\u2019ve picked up about 170 points in share overall based on the March data that was put out by the government.\nTed Decker: And just to kind of talk about e-commerce. E-commerce is a capability. It is not a business. And so I think it\u2019s very important to always look at the top level demand in the environment and what we\u2019ve delivered. So we don\u2019t break the business down like that. We intend to be there for the customer. However they\u2019d like to shop. There\u2019s been a lot of a dynamism in that as we work to the last 12 months, but we are satisfied that we\u2019ve been there for them and it\u2019s -- as Craig said, it\u2019s because of the investments we made in interconnected retail over the last few years.\nCraig Menear: And Michael, as you think of last year in the first quarter, the interest in buy online pickup in store and we stood up curbside again our customers chose to shop that way in a contactless or is least contact as possible in the early days of the pandemic. So that\u2019s returning to some more natural run rates.\nMichael Lasser: Got it. Thank you very much and good luck.\nCraig Menear: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Hey. Good morning. I\u2019m curious if you guys are surprised that your basket trend is holding so strong even as your traffic has improved so much?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. I mean, we are seeing customer engagement in all segments of our business, and when you -- we shared that through the progression of the last four quarters. Our Pro business has been strengthening as customers get more comfortable having folks in their home. Our services business has been strengthening for three quarters consecutively in a row now. Those are all big ticket drivers. And then as Ted called out, innovation has been a driver of expansion in our ticket, as well as inflation. And Ted, I don\u2019t know if you have any other comment.\nTed Decker: Yeah. I think it also speaks to projects. Again, people are engaged in projects and they\u2019re engaged in projects across the whole store. So with projects comes basket and ticket and we\u2019re certainly enjoying that.\nChuck Grom: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up for me would be, we talk about the big increase in lumber prices, curious what you\u2019re seeing on the demand side unit volume if it\u2019s starting to compress a little bit as those prices rise?\nCraig Menear: Well, the lumber environment is certainly unique and in the way we\u2019re thinking about it right now. Chuck, it\u2019s really a storm environment. It\u2019s very tough to look at traditional elasticities. Certainly prices are up, as I referenced in the call, sheet of OSB is quadrupled in price and it\u2019s up even more since the end of our fiscal quarter. But at the same time, demand has kept pace. And when we bring the product into the store itself and the mills are at capacity. We have plenty of wood fiber in the supply chain. The relative bottleneck is in the sawmill cutting capacity. We don\u2019t see a lot of capacity coming online. So we\u2019re probably not going to see a lot of finished lumber product in distribution. So as soon as that product hits our stores, it sells, certainly prices up and you would think there\u2019d be a supply and demand in our traditional elasticity equation there, but it\u2019s hard to determine the impact given the storm nature of the demand.\nChuck Grom: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning. So we know that you\u2019re working on your Home Depot supply chain almost for a couple of months [ph] now. Obviously, the overall industry is extremely strong. But I\u2019m curious, are there any examples you can share regarding how these new capabilities may be enabling you to either increase penetration rates and existing markets, will penetrate new markets where maybe you couldn\u2019t compete as well in the past?\nCraig Menear: I\u2019d say a couple of things and I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark. So, first of all, the ability to meet the kind of demand we\u2019ve seen on direct fulfilment. I think has been a direct result of the investments that we\u2019ve made in the business and the customer satisfaction and efficiency that we\u2019re seeing through our new flatbed distribution centers indicates to us that we\u2019re making real progress with the customer there. And Mark, I don\u2019t know if you want to add to that?\nMark Holifield: Sure, Craig. Yeah. We had a great first quarter in our supply chain development and we\u2019re on track based on that to continue to increase our fulfilment square footage over 70% this year. Specific to the results we\u2019re getting, in terms of the flatbed delivery centers, maybe I\u2019ll highlight that, that was really designed to provide store relief, increase our customer satisfaction and service to customers, expand our available assortment and delivery capabilities. And we now have four flatbed DCs open now in various stages of ramping. Dallas is the furthest along. It\u2019s ahead of our plans in terms of the flatbed sales comp, which are very strong and not just in dollars, but also in units and in number of deliveries. Our customer satisfaction has improved by 11 percentage points. We\u2019ve improved that on time and complete. And notably our Pro penetration is very strong, in fact, the preponderance of sales out of that facility are in fact Pro. So, really helping us to capture the Pro there in Dallas.\nScot Ciccarelli: And I guess a follow-up would just be my -- I guess my understanding at least historically has been the new HD Supply capability -- supply chain capabilities should enable you to penetrate markets where you really couldn\u2019t play before, you just didn\u2019t have that capability to be competitive. Are there any examples of where you\u2019re making progress on that front?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. I mean, the focus of the capabilities that we\u2019re building out is to be able to expand our reach into the pool of customer. We\u2019ve been very strong over the years with the smaller Pro and the unplanned purchase with a larger Pro. And what we\u2019re building is capabilities to actually extend into that planned purchase and we\u2019re seeing that beginning to play out. So we\u2019re very -- we are pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in the early stages.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Ms. Short your line is live.\nKaren Short: Oh! Sorry. Hi. Can you hear me?\nCraig Menear: Yeah, Karen.\nKaren Short: All right. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the market in general, I\u2019m wondering if you could frame how big you think the DIY market is versus the Pro market during -- I guess post-pandemic versus pre-pandemic. And then I had another slightly different angle on a different question.\nCraig Menear: Yeah. I mean, we really don\u2019t have data as it relates to what we think the growth in the market is, that\u2019s a pretty tough number to come by at this point.\nKaren Short: Okay.\nCraig Menear: I mean, obviously, we play in a big market straight out of the blocks. It\u2019s a $600 plus billion market in the MRO space that we play in, which is largely focused on multi-family as another $55 billion. So, but I have no way of knowing how much that\u2019s expanded as a result of pandemic.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then, Richard, I am going to ask a question on the actual that 14% framework that you had given and I realized that was just an attempt to give a framework. But when you look at your sales growth this quarter versus your EBIT growth, EBIT grew more than double sales growth, whereas when I look at prior quarters even if I add back COVID costs you won\u2019t be kind of had it like 10% spread. So I\u2019m wondering if that is the right relationship to think about going forward, especially because even in 1Q, as you noted, you had higher bonus accruals.\nRichard McPhail: Well, what I\u2019d say, as you know, the reason that we laid out the 14% was because we knew that we were coming to a year where COVID expenses were rolling off and investment expenses were rolling off. And so that was going to be -- and is the first year where we said look we\u2019re returning back to operating expense leverage that you can see in the P&L. We feel like we delivered that in Q1. We\u2019re very happy with the operating expense leverage and the flow-through relative to sales. And like we said, we\u2019re going to keep operating with discipline and we\u2019re going to drive operating expense leverage just as we intended. Margin will be a function of sales volume, obviously, but we\u2019re pleased with the relationship in Q1.\nCraig Menear: Like we\u2026\nKaren Short: Okay.\nCraig Menear: \u2026 naturally leverage with volume.\nKaren Short: Sorry, say that one more time?\nCraig Menear: We naturally leverage with volume.\nKaren Short: Oh! No. Oh! No.\nCraig Menear: There is absolute leverage still tend to the business with volume.\nKaren Short: Yeah. I understand that. I mean it\u2019s all a function of sales, but it just -- it is definitely a much wider gap on the two, because it would imply full year numbers are way too low depending on however that -- how that relationship continues.\nTed Decker: Well, just I think you, one of the other reasons that we laid out a hypothetical was because it is harder to read through on a one year or a two-year comparison in operating expense because of the fact that we were still in the middle of an investment program in 2019 and exiting it at the end of 2020. So, again, the best comment I can give is we were very happy with Q1 and how we drove operating expense leverage and flow-through.\nKaren Short: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So my first question is, do you think stimulus helps the DIY side of the business more than the Pro? And not sure if you looked at it this way, but on a two-year basis, did Pro accelerate more than the DIY side of the business?\nTed Decker: Yeah. I\u2019d say, Chris, on the stimulus situation, it\u2019s all consumer demand, whether it is the Pro buying for the consumer, because the consumer is doing something or the consumer buying for the Pro. So we kind of look at it as total demand.\nChristopher Horvers: And then, I guess, anything on a two-year. I guess, my thought on that is, Pro you got to get them in your house and there\u2019s a lot of backlog. So it seems like there could be a near-term bump on DIY versus Pro. So, and you also had some Pro comparisons last year where the Pro was not essential. So I was just curious if you add teased out what it was done on a two-year basis?\nTed Decker: Well, the two-year stack plainly is the consumer is outgrew the Pro modestly on a two-year basis. But I don\u2019t know that that provides information that\u2019s more helpful than saying that the Pro has come back to the job site, demand seems to be in a potentially more easily fulfilled through the Pro than it was a year ago. But like Craig said, I think you have to look at topline demand. Ultimately, this is all or almost all consumer demand that is being fulfilled in different ways. So if anything we\u2019re happy with the fact that the Pro seems to be -- it seems to have easier access to the job site and is getting to the job site easier.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Makes sense. And then May was a funny month last month, you had sort of stimulus spill-over into the first half, you had Pro restrictions and you talked about on a two-year basis, north of 30%. But can you maybe tease out how that month played out relative to the 27% total and/or even talk about one year comp trends quarter-to-date?\nTed Decker: I\u2019m not sure I understand your question.\nChristopher Horvers: You talked about in May being north of 30% on a two-year basis, last year you did a 27% in May, but there was a lot of noise. So boiling it down, can you talk about on a one year basis, what the business looks like so far in May?\nTed Decker: No. We\u2019re two weeks in. It\u2019s just too early. But as we said, demand remains strong.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Understood. Have a great rest of spring.\nTed Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Hey. Good morning. Richard, could you talk about performance at the gross margin line versus your initial plan and to what extent was lumber an incremental headwind. And when you think about the other moving parts around promo underlying comp leverage maybe mixing in HD Supply, is there anything in Q1 that changes your thinking for the full year gross margin framework?\nRichard McPhail: Well, so versus last year, again, just to recap, we were -- we saw a decrease of approximately 10 basis points in gross margin, 35 of which were from the increased penetration of lumber in our sales and so the net of that obviously shows margins up. There is no doubt there is cost pressure in the economy and in our environment, but hats off to our merchants and our supply chain for managing through that. And Ted, maybe I\u2019ll turn to you for a little bit of color.\nTed Decker: No. The merchants in the supply chain team did a fantastic job. Over the years we\u2019ve built tools and processes that give us some terrific visibility in great partnership with our finance teams. And as Craig has always said, we run the business as a portfolio and we\u2019re a project business and we\u2019re always looking to provide the best value to our customers on a project basis. Having said that, we certainly saw transportation pressure shrink on a relative basis was slightly improved, but we are still seeing shrink pressure. And then we\u2019re seeing some commodity as in lumber in non-commodity cost pressures, but the team has worked through that. Believe it or not, there is still cost out in the portfolio, so we still work on cost out and optimization of supply chain flows. And given the strong demand, we were -- our promotional cadence was slightly higher than last year, there were some early spring participation that we had completely canceled last year. And so we were up in some activity on promotions. The overall level of promotions in any required clearance activity was down meaningfully. So that is what gave the balance of the offset of the cost and mix pressures.\nZach Fadem: Got it. That\u2019s helpful color Ted. Another one for you, and also, Craig, as you think about all the drivers of home improvement spending today. Could you comment on how much of the industry you would quantify as repair and maintenance spending. How much is being driven by housing turnover and then what would you call discretionary?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. I -- honestly we have not taken the time to try to break that out in this demand environment. So, I really couldn\u2019t give you a breakdown on that. We know that repair and remodel is the essence of what our business is all about. And then, of course, we\u2019re there to help customers fulfill their dreams in terms of updating their homes. And clearly over the last year as customers who spend more time in their homes, they\u2019ve told us that our home has never more important than it is today. And many of those customers like myself, we have to see a whole lot of things that needed to be done around the home and they\u2019ve been going after that. When times got difficult in 2007and 2008, repair became more important than remodel. But we\u2019re certainly not in that kind of environment today. So I just don\u2019t have any way of knowing that expansion by those breakdowns at this point.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you. Can you just talk about new customer growth and whether you\u2019re seeing a greater degree of growth in new Pros versus new DIYers?\nTed Decker: Yes. We are very happy with our overall customer portfolio both DIY, Pro and aging in capabilities. While I won\u2019t give any specific numbers in breakouts, I can tell you that our customer files of both Pro and consumer have grown to help those file are very strong with a repurchase rate of developed customers growing faster than the new customers. So the new customers gain last year, we\u2019ve been able to keep package in our media with that terrific rates. In our Pro customers, I will let Bill Lennie comment on the activity we\u2019re seeing and engagement with our Pro customers with our B2B website, delivery capabilities, our new loyalty program, all of those are also adding to the stickiness of the Pro customer.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. And just on the services side. I mean how big is that now as a percent of sales. I know it\u2019s probably relatively small. But, I mean, are there areas where you think you can expand into services without competing with your Pro customers?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. That business is in the 4% to 5% range of [Technical Difficulty] We are very pleased with the results that we have seen in that business and we think we can do that without getting...\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. Maybe just start with a quick follow-up on the broader supply chain initiatives. Ted, I think you mentioned, 70% increase in distribution footage this year. So, maybe if you can update us on how many facilities that correlates to and any color on the cadence or the planned cadence of openings?\nTed Decker: Mark, do you want to take that?\nMark Holifield: Sure. We were on our way to 35 FDCs flatbed delivery centers. We have four open today. We\u2019re opening several more through the end of the year. We\u2019ve got a very solid pipeline there. Our MDOs we ended 2020 with 39, we opened eight in Q1 and we\u2019re opening more there on our way to a roughly 100. And then MDCs were -- we\u2019ve got two of those open, we open Houston during Q1. We have a healthy pipeline there, opening several more through the year as well and on our way to 20th or so on our MDCs.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Richard, I think, I don\u2019t believe you called out the incremental strategic investment spend impact when you walk through the expense line items. So maybe if you can just remind us on where we are right in terms of the trajectory of that strategic investment spend that\u2019s captive within the model.\nTed Decker: Well, at the end of Q4 last year, we announced that our strategic investment program that stretch from 2018 to 2020 was materially complete. And so going forward, our stance is that we will look to invest approximately 2% of sales every year in the form of CapEx. There\u2019ll be associated expense with that, but I would just consider that part of our expense structure going forward.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you. Best of luck.\nTed Decker: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman. Please proceed with your question.\nDennis McGill: Hi. Thank you. Ted, on the lumber side, when we think about, I guess, that\u2019s the biggest driver of the commodity inflation. Is it fair to assume that impact accelerated through the quarter and was largest in April? And then as we think about that impact so far in May, it would be similarly above what you experienced in the first quarter?\nTed Decker: Yes. It literally week-on-week, it\u2019s gone up and as we sit last week framing and panel are effectively quadrupled in the market index pricing, and again, each of those went up last week.\nDennis McGill: Okay. Perfect. And then anything else to learn from the category performance, as you look at passing the April comp of last year and looking at that on a two-year basis. Any category is actually accelerating on two-year basis versus decelerating? And I guess, just on the quarter itself, the one category that wasn\u2019t 20%. Just curious on what that was?\nCraig Menear: So the category that was not 20% was paint. We are very pleased with the performance in paint, but last year I think everyone stayed home and painted. So we had incredibly tough compares. So we didn\u2019t quite hit the 20% mark. Overall on what\u2019s accelerating, I would say, continued outdoor living has been very strong. So if all of you are interested in things like grills in patio sets, those are going to be in shorter supply as we get into the spring, because the demand is incredibly strong and things like patio. We do a fixed buy because most of that is important and we had to make the decision on the buy level quite some time ago. So that\u2019s been particularly strong.\nDennis McGill: Anything else on the other side, besides paint that you can call out as being a decelerating trend?\nCraig Menear: No.\nDennis McGill: All right. Much appreciate it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Hi. Thanks. Richard, if we think about that operating leverage and compare it to 2019, you\u2019re up 180 basis points. Is that -- is it -- as we think about it going forward, is it fair to say that, now where we want to be going forward. In other words, in the second quarter you normally are a few billion more sales and usually your operating margins a little higher than the first quarter, if you look over the last five years, is that or any reason why we shouldn\u2019t assume that sort of flow through now?\nRichard McPhail: Well, with respect to sales, we\u2019re not going to extrapolate what we\u2019ve seen into the future. Obviously, there is a degree of uncertainty on how the consumer is going to respond this year. I\u2019ll just say it again, Greg, when you compare the first quarter of this year to the first quarter of last year and you adjust for non-recurring expenses, we feel very pleased with the operating expense leverage that we drove and the flow-through that we drove at this level of volume.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then -- and if I could follow-up on inflation and mix, if the commodity part of it, that\u2019s just wasn\u2019t just lumber right, that 7 -- 375 bps was lumber and maybe copper and other commodities or was it specifically lumber. And then as part of that if you -- that was just lumber?\nRichard McPhail: Lumber and copper primarily, yes.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And so then if we look at that average basket up 10%, is it fair to say that overall inflation or average AUR was 500 bps, 600 bps of that basket increase?\nRichard McPhail: No.\nGreg Melich: Outdoor?\nCraig Menear: No.\nRichard McPhail: It was also driven by project nature of the business. The innovation that the merchants have brought to the market.\nGreg Melich: Yeah.\nCraig Menear: You\u2019ve got as a percentage of basket, I mean, it\u2019s a\u2026\nRichard McPhail: Yeah. We are not\u2026\nGreg Melich: Got it. Okay.\nRichard McPhail: \u2026 giving it by lumber.\nGreg Melich: So inflation hasn\u2019t widespread across the store, across the store it\u2019s more mix.\nCraig Menear: If you think about it from a ticket standpoint, the ticket is being driven by multitude of things. Yes, there is inflation and we\u2019ve been able to pass-through. But again, it\u2019s also driven by the fact that our Pro business strength drives a higher average ticket. Our service business drives a higher average ticket and so there is a number of factors that drove the ticket strength overall in the business, innovation within categories. So as you continue to expand and grow in cordless capability and outdoor power equipment, for example. The average price in a lawnmower that is a cordless versus gas is significantly higher. All of that contributes to driving the growth in ticket.\nGreg Melich: Got it. Thanks a lot. Good luck guys. Great job.\nCraig Menear: Thanks, Greg.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. So I was just wondering if you could talk about labor inflation and just the overall installation as you guys think about the back half of the year. So that\u2019s number one question?\nCraig Menear: Yeah. I mean, as you know, we converted part of our COVID expense into permanent labor cost in the November timeframe of 2020, and so obviously, all of that is in the performance that we just delivered. As it relates to labor in total, we\u2019re -- this is spring, we\u2019re hiring up, we\u2019ve been able to hire more folks this year than last year, even though we were ramping last year to cover the demand and so that\u2019s something that we work on a week-to-week basis to be flexible and agile right now is incredibly important. And the two areas that we\u2019re focused on, not knowing exactly how all this will play out is, inventory flow and labor. Those are the two things that we\u2019re focused on. Both the relatively short cycle planning and so that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to make sure we can cover the demand that\u2019s out there.\nScott Mushkin: And do you guys having any trouble getting labor and having wage rates or labor rates a lot in certain markets or is that really not an issue for you guys at this stage?\nCraig Menear: I mean, there is always variances by market and some markets are more challenging than others in any given year. But as I said, we\u2019ve actually hire more folks this year than we did last year.\nScott Mushkin: That\u2019s great, guys. That\u2019s all my questions. I appreciate the answer.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in August.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please, go ahead. \nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President and CEO; Jeff Kinnaird, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; Ann-Marie Campbell, Executive Vice President of US Stores & International Operations; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2022 was another record year for our business, as we achieved $157.4 billion in sales. We added over $6 billion in sales and increased diluted earnings per share 7.5% versus last year to $16.69. Over a three-year period, we have grown sales by over $47 billion and delivered diluted earnings per share growth of over 60%, while investing in the long-term health of our business. Throughout fiscal 2022, we continue to face reduced friction for our customers to improve the shopping experience. As Anne will discuss, we invested in an improved customer and associate experience in our stores by implementing a new store leadership structure. We also drove productivity within the four walls of our store through our Get Stores Right, or GSR space optimization initiative, and we've implemented new tools and technology in stores to reduce complexity for associates and improve customer service. We're also pleased with the traction we are seeing in our interconnected business. We've seen increased app engagement, downloads, conversion, as we've rolled out several enhancements, including an improved online experience for our Pro loyalty program, seamless connectivity for our military program and the launch of our new store mode feature, which makes store navigation and product interaction easier. We are very pleased with the continued progress on our supply chain build-out, as we reached an important milestone earlier this year. All our appliance delivery volume is now managed through our market delivery operations, significantly improving the customer experience. In the near term, we continue to navigate a unique environment. Throughout most of fiscal 2022, we observed a resilient customer, who is less price sensitive than we would have expected in the face of persistent inflation. In the third quarter, we noted some deceleration in certain products and categories, which was more pronounced in the fourth quarter. This along with the negative impact from lumber deflation led to fourth quarter comps that were slightly softer than anticipated. We are closely monitoring our elasticities and trends across the business and believe we have the tools team and experience to manage in any environment. This team has been effectively navigating the unprecedented growth in the last three years and I have full confidence in their ability to execute as we go forward. The investments in our associates, stores, digital platforms, supply chain, technology and other strategic initiatives have strengthened our business and enabled us to grow share and deliver exceptional shareholder value over the long-term. The most important investment we can make is in our people, which is why we are announcing that we are increasing annualized compensation by approximately $1 billion for our frontline hourly associates. We believe this investment will position us favorably in the market allowing us not only to attract the most qualified talent, but also retain the exceptional associate base that is already in place. Today, our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.09 per share which equates to an annual dividend of $8.36 per share. Turning to 2023. We are targeting approximately flat comp sales and a mid single-digit percent decline in diluted earnings per share compared to last year. Richard will take you through the details in a moment. While we expect this to be a year of moderation in demand for home improvement, we believe that the long-term underpinnings of our market remains strong and we are well positioned to leverage our distinct competitive advantages to capitalize on compelling growth opportunities in our space. I could not be more pleased with the resilience and strength that our associates have continued to demonstrate and I want to thank them and our supplier partners for their hard work and dedication serving our customers and communities. Now I'm going to turn it over to Ann-Marie Campbell, Executive Vice President of US Stores and International Operations to share a little more on how we are taking care of our associates and continuing to enhance the customer experience. \nAnn-Marie Campbell : Thanks Ted, and good morning everyone. I'm very excited to have the opportunity to spend a few minutes talking about the best team in retail and the many ways we are investing in the associate experience at The Home Depot. We know that our associates are a key differentiator and they are essential in helping us sustain the customer experience we strive for. In order to provide the best customer experience in home improvement, we must focus on cultivating the best associate experience in retail. So what does this mean to us? This means not only investing in competitive wages and benefits, but also providing tools training and development opportunities that make working at the Home Depot and enjoyable and rewarding experience. As Ted mentioned, we are making a significant investment of approximately $1 billion in compensation for frontline hourly associates. This is a meaningful investment that we believe will position us favorably in the marketplace. But this is just one component of the associate investment story. We know that the key to an engaged and committed workforce is investing in the person, taking an interest in them and in their development. To that end, we began the year with a new store leadership structure, the first time we have changed the structure since our company was founded. The driving forces of these changes were customer service and associate development. We created new management positions focused entirely on the customer service experience, increasing the number of managers on the floor at any given time. This frees up time for other store leaders to devote to associate training and development. The net result of all this is both an improved customer and associate experience, while also creating new career paths for our associates. Another important element of a best-in-class associate experience rests on simplification, how can we simplify processes and systems in our stores to enable associates to deliver a better customer experience and how can we simplify and streamline paths, so that an associate can spend more time serving our customers. One example we have talked about before is the work we've done to simplify order management in our stores with the order up initiative. Historically, our associates have to navigate dozens of systems but with order up, we have been able to streamline multiple systems into one that is simpler and more intuitive. We took simplification even further this year with the introduction of the new HD phone and associated applications such as Sidekick. The rollout of our HD phone was a direct result of associate feedback on the limitations of our first-generation in all devices known as first phones. For the first time ever, every associate on the floor will have an HD phone in their hand with enhanced communication features, tools and training capabilities. This increased accessibility to real-time support is significant in helping our associates better serve our customers. In addition to enhancing the customer service experience, the home -- the new HD phone provides real-time access to tools and applications such as Sidekick that helps associates prioritize the highest value tasks more effectively. Powered by machine learning, Sidekick directs associates to key bays where on-shelf availability is low or out exist. The HD phone empowers our associates to provide a best-in-class customer experience, increase operational efficiency and generally makes an associate job much easier. These are just a few examples of the many ways we're investing to enhance and improve the associate experience at The Home Depot. Our associates are trusted advisers for our customers and are the heartbeat of our company, and I want to thank them for all they do to take care of our customers. We will continue to invest in them with a focus on listening to their needs, maintaining competitive wages and benefits and continuing to enhance our tools, training and development opportunities. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Kinnaird: Thank you, Ann, and good morning everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. During the fourth quarter, our comp average ticket increased 5.8% and comp transactions decreased 6%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by inflation across our product categories, as well as demand for new and innovative products. Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth, by approximately 15 basis points during the fourth quarter. On lumber specifically, during the fourth quarter, we saw a significant decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago. On average, lumber prices were down over 50% year-over-year. Given this dynamic, comp sales were negatively impacted by approximately 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. Turning to our department comp performance for the fourth quarter, seven of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps. Building materials, plumbing, millwork, hardware, tools, outdoor garden and paint had comps above the company average. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000, were up 3.8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. While we saw big ticket strength across Pro-heavy categories like portable power, hype and fitting, and gypsum we did experience softness in other categories like laundry, soft flooring and roofing. During the fourth quarter, Pro sales growth outpaced DIY. Pro backlog still remain elevated compared to historical averages, and we saw positive comp performance in our build materials, plumbing and millwork departments as well as in certain bath-related categories. Turning to total company online sales. We are very pleased, with the performance of our digital assets. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased over 4%, compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This was driven by our continued investments, which are resonating with our customers. For those customers, that chose to transact with us online during the fourth quarter, approximately 45% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. During the fourth quarter, we held our Decorative Holiday, Gift Center and Black Friday events. 2022 was a record sales year for these events. We are the product authority in home improvement. And together with our supplier partners, we continue to offer the best product at the best value for our customers every day. A great example of this, is our recent partnership with Ecolab, a global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services. The Ecolab scientific clean product line, offers the cleaning solutions for commercial, industrial and residential use that Ecolab is known for to both our Pro and DIY customers, giving them access to innovative cleaning technology and this partnership is exclusive to The Home Depot. It marks the first of its kind, in Ecolab's 100-year history. We're looking forward to the year ahead particularly, with the spring selling season, right around the corner. We have a great lineup of products from live goods to outdoor power equipment. We continue to see an industry-wide shift from gas-powered to battery-powered tools. And as we've been discussing for some time, we have been leaning into this trend, offering a broad assortment of outdoor power equipment, with cordless technology. We have the brands that matter across tools and outdoor power including RYOBI, Milwaukee, DeWalt and Makita. In our spring gift center event, we are expanding our assortment to include, cordless innovation in mowers, trimmers, blowers and chainsaws. As an example, our Makita XGT platform will have over 125 professional-grade cordless tools. I'm particularly excited, about our new 40-volt XGT mower, that delivers gas-powered performance with high vacuum lift for premium cut quality. The XGT mower can cut over an acre in less than 60 minutes on two 40-volt XGT batteries. These Makita tools are exclusive to The Home Depot in the big-box retail channel. One of our key focuses in the spring is to provide great value and innovation for our customers within our live goods offerings. We continually work to strengthen our relationship with key vendors throughout the industry providing the best value, innovation and guarded performance for our customers. We have expanded our offerings in national, regional and proprietary brands such as Vigoro, Rio, Southern Living and Knockout Rose just to name a few. Our teams continue to look for better garden performance varieties that provide solutions for our customers and we are excited about the upcoming spring season. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard. \nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter, total sales were $35.8 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million, or 0.3% from last year. During the fourth quarter, our total company comps were essentially flat at negative 0.3% for the quarter. As Jeff mentioned, lumber prices in the quarter negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 70 basis points. We had comps of negative 1.3% in November, positive 0.8% in December, and negative 0.1% in January. Comps in the US were negative 0.3% for the quarter, with negative comps of 0.4% and 1.4% in November, positive 0.7% in December, and negative 0.1% in January. For the year, our sales totaled a record $157.4 billion with sales growth of $6.2 billion, or 4.1% versus fiscal 2021. For the year, total company comp sales increased 3.1% and US comp sales increased 2.9%. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was approximately 33.3%, an increase of seven basis points from last year. For the year, our gross margin was approximately 33.5%, a decrease of 10 basis points from last year. Gross margin was in line with our expectations, reflecting planned investments in our supply chain capabilities. Throughout the year, we continued to successfully offset significant transportation and product cost pressures as well as increased pressure from shrink during the back half of the year and we did this while maintaining our position as the customer's advocate for value. During the fourth quarter, operating expenses were approximately 20% of sales, representing an increase of 32 basis points from last year. Our operating expense deleverage is driven largely by charges unique to the quarter related to litigation in California storm-related expenses and an unfortunate fire in one of our stores. For the year, operating expenses were approximately 18.3% of sales representing a decrease of 13 basis points from fiscal 2021. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 13.3%, and for the year was approximately 15.3%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter increased by $85 million to $408 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than one year ago. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 22.6% and for fiscal 2022 was 23.9%. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $3.30, an increase of 2.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022 were $16.69, an increase of 7.5%, compared to fiscal 2021. During the year, we opened six new stores and lost a store in California due to a fire bringing our store count to 2,322 at the end of fiscal 2022. Retail selling square footage was approximately 241 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2022. Total sales per retail square foot were approximately $627 in fiscal 2022, the highest annual figure in our company's history. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $24.9 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion versus last year and inventory turns were 4.2 times, down from 5.2 times from the same period last year. Moving to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we invested approximately $900 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. This brings total capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 to $3.1 billion. During the year, we paid approximately $7.8 billion of dividends to our shareholders. We look to grow our dividend every year as we grow earnings. And as Ted mentioned today, we announced our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 10% to $2.09 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $8.36 per share. And finally, during fiscal 2022, we returned approximately $6.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases including $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 44.6% compared to 44.7% at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Now, I'll comment on our outlook for 2023. As we think about how 2023 might unfold, we think it's helpful to look back on our performance since 2019. From 2019 through 2022, we grew sales by $47.2 billion, a compound annual rate of 12.6%. During the first five quarters of this period from the first quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021, our sales were driven by significant ticket and transaction growth. This growth reflects factors unique to home improvement, as homeowners spent more time in their homes and took on more projects, as they saw their homes significantly increase in value over that period. The home improvement market also captured a greater share of the consumer's wallet, as spending on goods outpaced spending on services during the period. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2022, we reported strong sales and earnings growth driven by ticket while transactions steadily normalized back towards 2019 levels as the broader consumer economy shifted from goods and back into services. During this time, we continued to report positive sales growth in every quarter up to present. As we set targets for 2023, the context of the past three years led us to consider three factors that will likely influence our performance this year. First, the starting point for our target setting this year is our assumption regarding consumer spending. We've assumed like many economists that we will see flat real economic growth and consumer spending in 2023. Second, over the last seven quarters, we have seen our transactions gradually normalize as consumer spending has shifted from goods to services. We believe that if this shift continues at its current pace, the home improvement market would be down low-single digits. And third, as an offset to this pressure, we plan to continue to capture market share. Our competitive advantages, the investments we have made over many years and the unique advantage that our orange-blooded associates give us over our competition position us to take share in any environment. Taking these factors into account, we are targeting approximately flat sales and comp sales growth for 2023. Further, our operating margin target of 14.5% reflects approximately 60 basis points of impact from the compensation investment we announced today. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. Our diluted earnings per share, is targeted to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage. Outside of this target setting, if lumber prices remain at current levels for the remainder of our fiscal year that would equate to approximately 100 basis points of pressure to comp sales and an insignificant impact to earnings. At today's current price, this would imply more pressure in the first half than in the rest of the year. We plan to continue investing in our business with CapEx of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it's our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. We believe that we have positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment. The investments we've made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model. As we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen our position with customers, leverage our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Ed, in this environment, we're all just kind of guessing, but we assume that your guesses are a lot more educated than any of the rest of us. And in that case, what do you see as the downside risk for the home improvement market in turn, Home Depot this year, both in terms of the depth of a potential decline and the duration of a downturn. And in that case, how would Home Depot's earnings look in that scenario?\nTed Decker: Well, good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. We'll certainly address that. But before we go into downside, I'd like to set the tone on what we see that's favorable in the business trends. And we feel very good about our business. As we've just referenced, we've grown the business $47 billion over the last three years and grown earnings 60% during that time. Our associates did an amazing job, focusing on the customer in this challenging environment. And there's really no way we would have captured that much share, had we not been making the investments over the past few years. We also still see a healthy customer. I mean, we have good jobs, job growth, growing wages, still strong balance sheets. And most of our customers tend to own their home which has seen a significant increase in value. But as we've said, we do see a unique environment with many cross currents right now. Obviously, there's heightened inflation and rising interest rates, a tight labor market and moderating equity and housing markets. So, given all that, we do expect moderation in home improvement demand. Pro backlogs are still healthy, Michael, although they are off their peak from last year. And customers are still spending time at home. Homes are aging and worth about 40% more than they were before the start of the pandemic. But people are also starting to shift spend more towards services. And as we've said, we see some more price sensitivity. So, given all that, we've set the stage for a moderating year in 2023 and Richard will take you through some of the downside cases that you alluded to.\nRichard McPhail: So -- yes. So Michael, just to recap quickly, the way that we set our target and our guidance for the year was to first start with the assumption of flat consumer spending. And then with respect to the goods sector of the economy, as I said over the last seven quarters, we've seen that shift across the consumer economy from goods to services. So, we would anticipate this would put slight pressure on our market. And then, we look to overcome that by taking share in the manner that we've done consistently over the past several years. So we're targeting flat. If you -- there are so many factors that influence our market right now, as Ted alluded to. But if you were to take a hypothetical situation, let's just think about that share shift that we call out. So we look at the share that we currently capture as a share of consumption PCE. And we've tracked that through the COVID period and over the last few years. As we said in our guidance, that share shift continued at the rates at which we have seen theism [ph] behave. Currently, we would expect the market to face low single-digit negative pressure. But if you were to take perhaps a more extreme case and say, if that share of PCE that our market holds were to shift all the way back to 2019 levels by the end of the year that would imply pressure of call it mid-single-digit percentages. And so that would sort of be one way to get your mind around a hypothetical case, where share shift happens more rapidly than it has been.\nMichael Lasser: So in an environment, where the market down mid-single digits presumably Home Depot is going to do better than that. It will take some market share. So, can you frame out what you think the decremental margins would be in a down three or four type scenario? And as part of that, where do you think you would see this first? You're already starting to experience some challenges in areas like soft flooring and others that you outlined. Is that a precursor to weakness that you might experience in other categories? Thank you.\nRichard McPhail: So, just to keep it simple, because share shift is not a perfect science. In a hypothetical case, and again, we're not guiding this way, this is not a downside case, but in a hypothetical situation that share shift. If our comps were to be mid-single-digit negative, we would see operating margin around 14%, as kind of a corollary to that hypothetical situation.\nTed Decker: And Michael, Jeff can give some further detail. But the price sensitivity is \u2013 while it's a bit broader in Q4 than we saw in Q3, it's still primarily those larger single ticket more discretionary items that we've referenced before appliances grills patio, but still being a project-oriented business and with the Pro backlog, again, albeit down still strong. We're still seeing strong project business, but there is a bit more overall sensitivity as we saw more one-for-one offset with ticket and transaction in Q4.\nJeff Kinnaird: Yeah. Thank you, Ted. So yeah, in general to your comments more broad than what we saw in the third quarter, but still very good project demand. If you look at the seven departments that outperformed the plumbing business building materials millwork hardware tools, and paint above our company average and just reflected the strength of the project business. To your point, Michael, we're watching categories like flooring very closely. We're working assortments. We're working different opportunities in the market to look at what's happening in categories like flooring, but some broader-based sensitivity, but still good strength in the overall business.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much, and good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. So, can you please clarify your expectations for unit elasticity, if we were to start to see same \u2013 see inflation pressures ease? And then secondly, any common denominators in categories or geographies, where you're starting to see some of the incremental softness? Thanks.\nTed Decker: Sure, Scot. I think, the last two years, we've had the same guidance that we're having this year, and that is that, whatever inflation is represented in our average unit retail in ticket, would be offset by transactions. So we started the year thinking about a balance of ticket and transaction, and that higher ticket driven by inflation would be offset with transactions. The outperformance of the prior two years was that we didn't see that much sensitivity. The consumer, our customer was much more resilient sort of purchase through that elasticity curve if you will. What we are seeing now is some more sensitivity and we had almost an exact one-for-one offset in Q4. That's what we're expecting for 2023, that there is still inflation. I mean, we are still in an inflationary environment, as we saw from CPI and PPI results last week. Although, it is abating and its abating more I would say in our industry, our costs on the table are much lower than they had been. Our wraparounds some price moves going into 2023 will be much lower than they had been in the prior two years. And so, while we're still expecting an offset in transactions, because the ticket won't be as high the negative transactions won't be as low, but still net to that flat guidance for 2023.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Thank you. And then, any common denominator in terms of category or geographies where you're seeing some of the incremental softness? Is it just big ticket, or is there...\nTed Decker: Yeah, big ticket would be the ones that I called out before, that have continued with softness. In the geographies, while we had a little more variability of our comp range. There's no particular geography that you call out other than weather-impacted ones that would show anything off the mean for us.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi. Good morning everyone. Maybe related to the last question, we've had home prices, have decelerated for about six to eight months now, and we know existing home sales are in deep negative territory. If you align your business against those trends and in markets where they're more pronounced, is there a decoupling? In other words, the business is stable despite prices have fallen and existing home sales being down 20%, 30%.\nRichard McPhail: Thanks, Simeon. On home prices, we know over the long-term that our business does correlate to price appreciation. Obviously, we've had unprecedented growth and appreciation since 2019. Home prices peaked in June of 2022. In fact, at that point, they were 45% higher than they were at the end of 2019. They have regressed by about 3%, since that point. So we've seen some modest correction. But I can tell you, we have not seen an impact on a market-by-market basis, since that peak. There's no relationship with comp sales and the home price appreciation or correction that we've seen. On housing turnover, there's just that interesting dynamic of whether -- what is actually happening in housing turnover. They just aren't the willing sellers out there to the degree that they have been in past eras. We're in such a healthy -- our customer our homeowner customers in such a healthy position that you just think about their motive for selling. As you know 90% -- over 90% of US homeowners either own their homes outright or have fixed rate mortgages under 5%. And so that incentive to sell and move to a higher rate mortgage just isn't there. And in fact, the incentive is really there to improve in place. So it's hard to say what the housing economy -- how the housing economy might impact us, but no to answer your first question to date since 2022, we haven't seen a relationship.\nSimeon Gutman: And a follow-up to a point that was made earlier that if the share of PCE reverts back to the 2019 level, do you take a view on this, or is there any confidence that it doesn't. And it's a view really on digestion. We've seen a couple of categories in real terms actually overcorrect the 2019, only two right now, but not home improvement obviously. But how confident are you that we don't need to go back that far, or that the digestion or so is done and we can hang out at the current share that we are?\nRichard McPhail: I think the only thing I look at really is the trajectory that we've observed. I think that's the best information we can use. We're not making an assumption about whether in your terms there's full digestion or not.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. Good luck.\nTed Decker: And Simeon I would say this -- as we said this is a unique period and hard to gauge on the shortest horizon. But we are just so incredibly bullish on the longer horizon for this industry. Just all the dynamics that we know about, starting with the fundamental shortage of housing, I mean we're still whether it's one million, two million, three million units short in with household formation and population growth and aging housing stock, all the things that we talk about. I mean that is all very much in place. And as the market works its way through PCE reversion or not or level of that and inflation mortgage rates that will all settle and what you're left with is still a market that is underserved in housing units built. And over half the homes are over 40 years old. And as Richard said, they remain in place with owning the home in low mortgage rates. People are going to want to make more significant improvements on those homes. So -- remaining just couldn't be more bullish on the longer term view of this industry.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions that are both maybe more philosophical question. But first off and Ted just some of the comments made here about increased price sensitivity, I think on part of your consumers and maybe that turned a little more severe than we saw in the third quarter. One of the big -- I think I probably followed Home Depot for a long time one of the big [Technical Difficulty] understand the data\u2026\nIsabel Janci: Brian, you're breaking up. Can you repeat that?\nBrian Nagel: I\u2019m sorry. We'll move around here. So the question I'll make it short. The question I'm having is as you're looking at this with the consumer behavior, we're all seeking or searching right now for those signs of weakening consumer given a tempered backdrop. But do you believe that we're still in the one-off or what you're seeing is more one-off in nature, or is this really the beginning of a weaker trend coming that could persist over the next few quarters?\nJeff Kinnaird: Brian, it's Jeff. As we talked about price sensitivity earlier, we are seeing some additional sensitivity or saw some additional sensitivity in Q4 versus Q3. But let me give you a real-time example of how we're looking at the business and I'll go to the cleaning business as an example. As I spoke about in my prepared remarks, we launched in this quarter Ecolab, which is a premium cleaning brand in the market, which we're seeing exceptional performance. It is a trade-up category for many consumers, many pros and we're just really, really excited about the partnership and the long-term opportunity in that category. At the same time, we're expanding our HDX cleaning lineup and that's just a great everyday value brand for our customers and we're seeing a great pickup in that brand as well. So our merchants take the time by category to engineer what results they want to see and cleaning is a great example there. At the same time, we're watching categories very closely like appliances, like patio furniture, like grill that we spoke about in Q3 and earlier today to ensure that we are positioned right for the current environment.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. I appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Can you talk about what you saw from a rate of change in DIY versus Pro in 4Q relative to 3Q? Are you seeing one side change faster than the other? And how does that inform how you're thinking about the business in 2023? \nTed Decker: I don't know if we saw a rate of change Chris. The highlight remains the high spend Pro. I mean, that's still the strongest piece of the business. But I wouldn't say there was a rate of change much beyond that.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then I guess can you share your -- the puts and takes on the cadence of 2023 from a top line perspective? You have DIY versus Pro. You've got tough lumber laps in the near term, but you also have the easier spring lap. And so how are you thinking about the cadence of the year? If you sort of had a did a zero in 4Q and you ran seasonal, you can get to a lot of different outcomes. So how are you thinking about the cadence? And just to clarify, is the 100 basis points of lumber headwind in the top line guide?\nRichard McPhail: Right. So Chris, our guidance assumes that we'll comp slightly lower in the first half than the second half. The lumber pressure we called out is sort of outside of guidance. There's so much volatility in that that we would not want to put that in guidance. There is 100 basis points of pressure to the year. If the number remains at current prices that pressure exists predominantly in the first half.\nJeff Kinnaird: And Chris, as Richard mentioned, it's been a very turbulent couple of years in the lumber market. To give you an example of what we faced in the fourth quarter on the framing side, lumber was $420 per thousand on average compared to $886 on average in 2021. To put that in retail dollar sense for everyone, a 2x4 study which is one of our top unit movers in the business, retail on average were $3.40 in the fourth quarter of this year. Last year, it was over $5. Now we did make some ground back on units. So you could say that when you see a lumber market depressed or normalized, you see good unit productivity and you see good overall project business. As you look forward into the front half that same 2x4 stud is over $10. It's now $3.50. So we'll see good unit productivity and certainly an opportunity to drive more project-related business.\nRichard McPhail: And Chris, another reason we leave that sort of lumber hypothetical case outside of guidance, if that pressure does exist and come through we would not see any material impact to earnings.\nChris Horvers: Right. So you're not \u2013 there could be a price headwind but there could be some offsetting positive elasticity on that side. And so net-net that plus the fact that doesn't hit bottom line it's outside the guide.\nRichard McPhail: That's correct. You got it.\nChris Horvers: Thanks so much. Have a great spring.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. I wanted to start really trying to expand on the $1 billion investment that was announced. So curious Ted or Richard or the team can you comment on how the investment impacts planned compensation mix for the frontline associate in 2023 on average inclusive of how we should think about the resetting of the success sharing program? \nTed Decker: Sure. Yes, Steven and Ann will take you through some of the detail on the rates. But just to talk about this investment, we feel just great about doing this for our associates. Customer service at The Home Depot starts with our associates and we believe this investment is consistent with our values and is going to position us favorably in the market. We've been operating successfully in a pressured labor market. We all know labor has been tighter and rates have been higher. But just last year we were able to hire 200,000 associates. But we believe this move is going to protect our customer experience for the near medium and long-term. We'll be able to track the most qualified candidates and retain the exceptional associate base that we already have. So we not only increased our starting wages again, Ann will go into some detail but we increased wages for every single frontline associate. And there's a term in retail you get compression when you raise the starting rates with tenured associates. We addressed compression in a meaningful way in this $1 billion investment. So our tenured associates saw real wage increases with this move. And we hope to improve retention through this. That's why we call it an investment, and it's going to improve the customer experience through a more effective associate who's just in the building longer, understands our procedures and is much more effective engaging with the customer and selling. And we harken back to our values wheel of investing in our associates and what our founders said that, if we take care of our associates, they take care of the customer and everything takes care of itself. And that's what this investment is all about. But Ann, you can give some more detail, please. \nAnn-Marie Campbell: Yes. Thank you, Ted. First of all the investment is incremental. So you asked about success sharing and that is still a part of our total compensation package. One of the things I spoke about around how we think about investing in our associates. Wage is one component of it. We think about it not only with wage but benefits but also the environment we create to promote or associate them within. And I think the piece that I will say, we've spoken about this before that close to 90% of our leaders started on the floor of the store. And why is that important? This $1 billion investment puts us favorably in the marketplace so we can recruit, retain and attract the best leaders, because they are the future leaders for the company. So, this is an incremental investment. Every single hourly associate will receive an increase. And to Ted's point, our more tenured associates, who are even key when we think about going into the spring season, also got an incremental investment, a pep in their step to continue to take market share in 2023.\nTed Decker: And Steven, while we don't disclose average wages and we've always and will continue to be competitive on a market-by-market level, and we've been competitive, it's why we're able to hire the 200,000 people last year, but after this change our starting rate in any one market, there'll be no market under $15 for a starting rate. And starting rates go much higher than that depending on the market. And then the average wage, again, particularly with the investment in every associate, including tenured with addressing compression, we have an average wage that is well, well above the $15.\nSteven Forbes: I appreciate the color. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Richard. I think we're sort of targeting recapturing a 60% accounts payable to inventory ratio. But maybe just clarify if that's still the goal and when we should expect to achieve that this year?\nRichard McPhail: Well, we're still -- while we know that global supply chains are improving, at least relative to where we were last year at this time. We're still pulling forward inventory. We still see extended lead times. And we think that 2023 is going to be a year of continued improvement in supply chains. So, we are encouraged by the inventory movements in our business. The year-over-year inventory increase was the smallest quarterly increase of the entire year. And so we feel good about our inventory productivity. And again, we've been managing in kind of exceptional circumstances. But yes, I think over the long run, you will see us heading back to convention with respect to working capital.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nRichard McPhail: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much. Good to talk to you. The first question I just want to ask is, looking at the relationship on sales growth versus EBIT growth, and I'm actually talking about this excluding the $1 billion investment, obviously EBIT growth on a one-year basis is decently below sales growth. So, wondering just how to think about that relationship, including or excluding but going forward. And then, wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing on 1Q to-date in terms of comp performance?\nRichard McPhail: Sure. So it may be more helpful to talk about the construction of operating margin year-to-year, just to kind of tick that out. That gives you a better sense. So, in a flat comp environment, we would expect to see deleverage on a fixed cost base and obviously in an inflationary environment as exists today. That deleverage is somewhere between 30 to 40 basis points. In addition, our wage investment represents about 60 basis points of movement in year-to-year wage. And then offsetting that are productivity initiatives that we expect will generate between 10 and 20 basis points of recapture of margin. And so that's how we walk from the 15.3 to the 14.5. Over the long run, we always expect to grow operating income faster than sales. We've been managing in a unique environment and certainly our guidance implies the wage investment that we've made today. And the second part of your question I'm sorry I forgot.\nKaren Short: It was just -- could you -- any color you could provide on 1Q performance in terms of comps?\nRichard McPhail: Well, as I shared just a few questions ago we do anticipate that comps in the first half will be slightly lower than the second half and our performance to-date reflects that guidance.\nKaren Short: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. Richard it sounds like most of the margin pressure in 2023 is expected to land at the operating expense line. And I'm curious if you could talk to the puts and takes to gross margin specifically. And is it fair to assume the inflection we saw in Q4 to slightly positive is a fair year-over-year run rate from here just given the bulk of your supply chain investments are running their course and then freighted commodities could be a tailwind?\nRichard McPhail: There are a lot of ins and outs. There are a lot of ins and outs in 2022. We basically delivered gross margin precisely where we anticipated to at the beginning of the year. And underlying that was a lot of product costs and transportation costs offset by actions and within that continued supply chain investment in our downstream or delivery operations. For 2023, we're targeting gross margin that's roughly flat year-over-year. Again, it will be a year of several ins and outs. Product cost inflation has decreased but does persist above historical levels. Transportation costs should actually be a tailwind. But we still have investment in our supply chain. And look we did see some increased pressure from shrink in the back half, right? So, we've got a lot of ins and outs. But roughly speaking we're targeting essentially flat gross margin for the year. \nZach Fadem: Got it. That's helpful. And then following up on the $1 billion in wage investment. Can you talk about where this puts you competitively versus your peers? And then if for whatever reason if your comp appears to be falling short of that flattish expectation range, would you still make the planned investments in 2023, or could you spread them out over a couple of years? \nRichard McPhail: We're committed to our investment. That's done. With respect to how we manage our P&L, we always operate with a degree of financial flexibility. And so, in any environment, we're going to assess, what that environment means for us, and how we should manage the P&L.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nA \u2013 Isabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Zaccone: Good morning, all. Thanks for filling me in here. I wanted to circle back to the duration part of Michael's, first question. Ted, when you think about home improvement demand seeing a moderation this year, when you take a little bit of a more medium-term outlook over the next couple of years, just since you've seen strength in the business for the last three, what are you focused on with the health of the homeowner that may be this moderation could last couple of years in nature? \nTed Decker: Well, as we've said, we're thrilled with the share, we captured and the sales we drove. And while we don't love the moderation, you can't fight the tide, if you will with PCE spend going back to services, people traveling and whatnot. But the two main things, that we're going to stay focused on, to take share, one, I say the consumer, the consumer rights to check for all projects, even if the Pro is doing the work. But for the consumer, we are laser-focused on delivering the best interconnected frictionless, shopping experience. I mean, retail as we know, is all about interconnection, physical world in the digital world. And we are laser-focused. Matt Carey and his team is focused on taking out all friction in that. And as we continue to delight customers, with that frictionless experience, we'll look to gain more share. And then, we haven't talked much about the Pro in this call, but we are still 100% focused on building out all the capabilities that Pro ecosystem, that is going to allow us to capture more share of wallet with the Pro and move up to larger plan purchases. And extremely pleased with the results, we're seeing as we continue to put those capabilities, in the marketplace. So that's what we're going to do to keep taking share regardless of the environment, or the duration of the environment. \nSteven Zaccone: Okay. Thanks. And then the brief follow-up, I had was just a question on the promotional environment. It really hasn't been that much of an issue, in home improvement the last couple of years. Would you expect it to be more of a factor this year, just given an overall moderation in demand? \nJeff Kinnaird: Hi, Steven, it's Jeff. No nothing specific to call out on the promotional environment, as we head into the first quarter further into the first quarter. We're excited about the value, we're ready -- we're offering our customers. And our spring sets, have gone exceptionally well, and we're looking forward to the spring season. But no change, that we can predict in the promotional environment. \nSteven Zaccone: Thanks \nOperator: Thank you. Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you, for closing comments. \nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine and thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in May. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-11-15 12:46:10", "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to The Home Depot Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

Today\u2019s presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning. Sales for the third quarter were $38.9 billion, up 5.6% from the same period last year. Comp sales were up 4.3% from the same period last year, and our U.S. stores had positive comps of 4.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.24 in the third quarter compared to $3.92 in the third quarter of last year. From a geographical perspective, each of our 19 U.S. regions delivered positive comps versus last year, while Mexico posted comps above the Company average and Canada below the Company average, both in local currency. The team has done a fantastic job serving our customers while continuing to navigate global supply chain disruptions, inflation and a tight labor market. This quarter also marked another active hurricane season. As they always do, our associates and suppliers did an incredible job supporting those in the path of both Hurricanes Fiona and Ian and our thoughts continue to be with those impacted by these storms. Our results in the quarter reflect continued solid demand for home improvement projects. While we did see some deceleration in certain products and categories, as Jeff will detail, the project business remains strong across most of our departments. We also saw year-over-year growth with both, our Pro and DIY customers in the quarter. While the business performed very well and our consumer remains resilient, we are navigating a unique environment. We can\u2019t predict how the evolving macroeconomic backdrop will impact our customer going forward. However, we continue to closely monitor elasticities and trends across our business and believe we have the tools, team and the experience to effectively manage in any environment. Despite near-term uncertainties, we believe the long-term underpinnings of demand for home improvement remains strong, and we are well positioned to leverage our distinct competitive advantages to capitalize on compelling growth opportunities in our space. We are pleased with the traction we are seeing in our interconnected business as we continue to build on our momentum with both, our Pro and DIY customers. For example, as we have better functionality and capabilities in our Home Depot app, we see greater engagement. In fact, throughout the year, we have seen strong double-digit growth in monthly active users versus last year. The growth is attributable to several enhancements we have made, including an improved online experience for our Pro loyalty program, the seamless connectivity we\u2019ve provided for a military program and the launch of our new store mode feature, which makes navigating the store and interacting with products much easier. These enhancements translate to less friction of our customers as they navigate the digital world and connect to the physical world. We also remain focused on driving continuous improvement in productivity within the four walls of our store to enhance both the associate and customer experience. We are currently launching a new application on our in-store mobile devices called Sidekick, which is an in-aisle tasking tool designed to direct associates to the highest value tasks in real time. The tool will direct associates to key bays where on-shelf availability is low or outs exist. By simplifying our operations, we can generate productivity to enhance both, the customer and associate experience. For the Pro customer, we remain focused on investing in an ecosystem of capabilities, including enhanced fulfilment, a more personalized online experience as well as other business management tools to drive deeper engagement with these customers. While we are focused on removing friction from the shopping experience, we are also onboarding capabilities to help our Pros run their businesses more efficiently. Our Pros tell us that finding qualified skilled labor is a pain point in their business. To that end, we recently announced our Path to Pro platform, connecting skilled trades people with hiring trades professionals. This unique and proprietary platform is available at no cost to all Pro extra members. It already contains thousands of candidates and Pros have begun posting their open jobs. Our team remains focused on what is most important, our associates and customers, our merchants, store and MET teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter. I\u2019d like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Kinnaird: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the third quarter, we continued to see solid demand for home improvement projects and strong execution from our teams and supplier partners. Turning to our comp performance during the third quarter: 11 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps. Build materials, plumbing, lumber, millwork, paint and hardware had comps above the company average. All other departments with the exception of appliances, flooring and indoor garden were positive, but below the Company average. During the third quarter, our comp average ticket increased 8.8% and comp transactions decreased 4.4%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by inflation across our product categories as well as demand for new and innovative products. Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 200 basis points during the third quarter, driven by inflation in build materials, lumber and copper. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up 10.1% compared to the third quarter of last year. We saw a big ticket strength across many Pro-heavy categories like fasteners, pipe and fittings and gypsum. During the third quarter, both Pro and DIY sales growth were positive, with Pro outpacing DIY. We\u2019re encouraged by the continued momentum we are seeing with both our Pro and DIY customers. In addition, our Pros tell us their backlogs remain strong. During the quarter, our project business remained healthy. This can be seen in the double-digit comp performance of our build materials, plumbing, lumber and millwork departments as well as in other categories like fencing, siding, conduit boxes and fittings, hubs and showers and cabinets. We\u2019re also encouraged by the momentum we continue to see with our larger Pro customers. These medium to large repair-remodel Pros continue to post strong double-digit comps. We believe we are building a unique interconnected Pro ecosystem that will increase our ability to grow share in a $450 billion addressable Pro space. To serve the Pro, it\u2019s about removing friction through a multitude of enhanced product offerings and capabilities. We feel confident that the investments across our Pro ecosystem are resonating and that we continue to gain share with this important customer. As you know, we\u2019ve been on a journey to remove friction from our interconnected shopping experience. A great example of this was our announcement in December of 2017 to own more of the appliance delivery end-to-end. And in the third quarter, we achieved an important milestone. We now have 100% of our appliance delivery volume managed through our market delivery operations. This has significantly improved the customer experience. On-time and complete deliveries have increased meaningfully and customer satisfaction metrics have increased by approximately 6 percentage points compared to the third quarter of last year. Turning to total company online sales. We are very pleased with the performance of our digital assets. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased nearly 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. This was driven by our continued investments, which are resonating with our customers. For example, during the quarter, lead times improved across different fulfilment capabilities, which drove greater conversion. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the third quarter, approximately 50% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. We\u2019re excited about the holiday season. During the third quarter, we hosted our Halloween event and could not be happier with the results. 2022 was a record sales year for our Halloween program, both in-store and online, as our customers continue to add to their collection with our unique and exclusive assortment. As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we intend to continue this momentum with our annual holiday, Black Friday and gift center events. Our teams have sourced the most compelling artificial tree assortment we have ever had, which makes it easier for our customers to find the perfect tree for their holiday. In terms of our decorative holiday program, we couldn\u2019t be happier with our industry-leading assortment with extraordinary features and functionality that looks great and also reflects exceptional value. In our gift center, we continue to lean into brands that matter most for our customers with our assortment of Milwaukee, RYOBI, Makita, DEWALT, RIDGID, Husky and more. Earlier this fall, we launched the next generation of the Milwaukee drill and Drive M18 fuel lineup, offering more power, run time and increased safety for our customers. In our gift center, we are featuring this innovation in combo kits with 4 tools and 2 tools. And we have our exclusive RIDGID 4 tool, 18-volt brushless combination kit with 2 free tools, all backed by our lifetime service agreement. And in appliances, we have exciting offers on LG, Samsung, Flash, Oracle, GE and Frigidaire. We have multiple exclusive offers, including the LG side-by-side refrigerator with craft ice, a great innovation and ice-making. As with prior years, we\u2019ve extended these events over several weeks, and we believe we are well positioned with the right brands, the right inventory and a great customer experience. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, total sales were $38.9 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 5.6% from last year. During the third quarter, our total company comps were positive 4.3%, with positive comps of 7.1% in August, 4.4% in September and 2.1% in October. Comps in the U.S. were positive 4.5% for the quarter, with positive comps of 7.2% in August, 4.2% in September and 2.5% in October. On a three-year basis, monthly comps were consistent across the quarter. In the third quarter, our gross margin was approximately 34%, a decrease of approximately 10 basis points from last year, primarily driven by supply chain investments. We continue to successfully offset significant transportation and product cost pressures while maintaining our position as the customer\u2019s advocate for value. During the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased 18 basis points to 18.2%. Our operating expense performance was in line with our expectations, which reflected continued wage investments as well as planned investments designed to drive efficiency in our store environment. Our operating margin for the third quarter was 15.8% compared to 15.7% in the third quarter of 2021. Interest and other expense for the third quarter increased by $80 million to $406 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than one year ago. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4%, down from 24.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $4.24, an increase of 8.2% compared to the third quarter of 2021. During the third quarter, we opened three new stores, one in the U.S. and two in Mexico, bringing our total store count to 2,319. Retail selling square footage was approximately 241 million square feet. At the end of the third quarter, inventories were $25.7 billion, up $5.1 billion compared to the third quarter of 2021. Inventory turns were 4.3 times, down from 5.4 times last year. And our inventory growth primarily reflects product cost inflation and strategic decisions in response to continued global supply chain disruption. Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. During the third quarter, we invested $770 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $1.9 billion in dividends to our shareholders and we returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 43.3%, down from 43.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Now, I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2022. As you heard from Ted, we are very pleased with the solid performance we saw during the third quarter. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2022. We expect comp sales growth of approximately 3% for fiscal 2022. We expect comp sales to be positive for the fourth quarter. We expect our fiscal 2022 operating margin to be approximately 15.4% for the year. And we expect mid-single-digit percentage growth in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2021. As we\u2019ve said throughout the year, we find ourselves in a unique environment with many cross-currents. We are operating in a broad-based inflationary environment, not seen in four decades while managing through constrained global supply chain conditions, all against the backdrop of monetary policy shifts intended to moderate demand. To date, our customer has proven resilient. We feel confident that we will continue to manage with flexibility through a dynamic environment while growing faster than our market and delivering exceptional shareholder value. Before opening the call for questions, we are pleased to announce that we will be holding an investor conference on June 13, 2023 in New York City. We will share more details in the near future, but for now, please hold the date. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The sentiment and narrative around your stock is so heavily focused right now on factors that are out of the Home Depot\u2019s control, like the state of the housing market and its ultimate impact on home improvement demand. So, can you help frame what is in your control? If home improvement demand, for example, was down 5% next year, is the state of your initiative such that Home Depot could gain a couple of hundred basis points of market share, and in that environment, you\u2019d only be down, call it, 3%? And if your comps were only down 3%, given the flexibility that you have with your cost structure coupled with your current capitalization that affords you to buy back a lot of stock, you could actually grow earnings in that sort of scenario.\nTed Decker: Hey. Good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. A lot of detail there that I won\u2019t get into specifics but assure you that we\u2019d look forward to taking share in any environment. There is a lot of noise around housing and home improvement. And you\u2019ve heard some of this before, but if I can just step back a minute and lay out the environment the way we see it. I mean, we still feel very good, Michael, about our business. We just reported another strong quarter and reaffirmed our guidance for the year. And remember, we\u2019ve grown this business $47 billion in the last two and three quarters a year. From our core customer, we think our customer is still healthy. I mean, our customer tends to have a good job, growing wages, strong balance sheets. They own their home and have seen increased home equity. However, as Richard said in his prepared notes, I mean it is a unique environment, lots of cross-currents, inflation and rising interest rates, et cetera. But given all that, our customer has remained resilient and engaged. As we said, both our Pro and DIY customers grew again in this past quarter. Project demand, in particular, is very strong. Our Pro sales are strong and our Pro intercepts with our customers indicate that their backlogs are still very healthy. Customers are still spending lots of time at home. We\u2019re not all back at work five days a week. These homes continue to age. And they\u2019re worth 40% more than they were pre pandemic. Now, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get into some housing questions and housing values may go down a bit, but we\u2019re still going to be up meaningfully on a two-year basis. We did see some deceleration in certain products and categories. And again, that\u2019s difficult to get at a root cause. Is it a consumer pulling back in general? Is there a reaction to price inflation? Do we have some pull forward in certain categories that people bought so much of certain categories during the pandemic, or are they moving on to other projects? Our transactions have been stronger than initially thought with this inflation. I mean, that\u2019s why we have raised guidance throughout the year is that the price sensitivity wasn\u2019t as strong as we thought it would be. However, our guidance implies that fourth quarter comps will be the lowest for the year, albeit positive and we have tougher comps from Q4 last year. So, with all of that as a backdrop, I mean, as I said in my comments, we believe we have the team, the strategy, the initiatives with each of our consumer and Pro that we\u2019ll continue to take share in any operating environment. And while there may be some of these cross-currents in the next X quarters in housing, we still feel the backdrop of housing, the fundamental shortage of housing in this country and the aging of homes is incredibly strong for our space in the medium to long term.\nMichael Lasser: That\u2019s very helpful framework. But in light of some of the deceleration that you\u2019re seeing, one might assume that that might be a prelude to what could be a more pronounced deceleration into \u201823, especially as some of the material benefit from inflation that the Home Depot has experienced this year fades. So, is it best to recalibrate our expectations and think and model more about a negative comp in 2023 for the Home Depot, even if it\u2019s just slightly negative?\nTed Decker: Well, we\u2019ll talk about \u201823 after our fourth quarter earnings call in February. Again, we remain incredibly bullish. There are certainly factors outside of our control. Are the Fed actions going to ultimately take us to a recession? If so, how deep that might be? Those are things that we\u2019re all wrestling with and everyone has an opinion. But we\u2019re focused on what we can control, rolling out our strategies, delighting our customers and taking share in any environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Focusing on housing. So housing metrics are decelerating much quicker than your comps or your comp stacks. Is this just a lag effect? I don\u2019t know if this lag is longer than other lags or -- and Ted, you just made the case that maybe sales decouple from these metrics. I assume it\u2019s temporary because of home equity, and we\u2019re spending more time in our home, or are you suggesting that maybe it\u2019s not temporary because we\u2019re spending more time in our home?\nRichard McPhail: So, Simeon, it\u2019s Richard. Just to maybe sort of put some further points on Ted\u2019s backdrop, a lot is made of home prices and -- home price appreciation change and home price appreciation, we think, has always driven home improvement demand, and we\u2019ve talked that to you for a long time. But what we also really ran into even, I\u2019d call it, the middle part of the last decade was that as home prices begin to -- call it, become more steady, price discovery, in our view, became a little bit harder. And so, the question has always been, number one, is there a lag to spending? Are you going to spend in that specific period when you know your home price is appreciated or is there a halo effect that lags over multiple periods? And our hypothesis is yes. That\u2019s what we saw in the last decade. And I think that that just sort of holds true from an intuitive perspective. But I think there\u2019s another -- there are so many points that are important. And I think we are all somewhat anchored to what we observed in 2008 and \u201809, and many of the folks on this call, in fact, almost all of us were here during 2008, 2009. You have a situation where 25% of homeowners were underwater on their mortgages. You had really a relationship that we saw in our comp sales driven by acceleration in foreclosures. So, it wasn\u2019t -- we were not in a period of home price depreciation that you\u2019re talking about single digits. We had a massive price correction in 2006 to 2008. There was price discovery every single day on the front of the newspaper and millions of forced sellers that were creating that price discovery. When I look at the situation now, as Ted said, we have home price appreciation of essentially 40% year-over-year -- sorry, over the last three years. In fact, year-over-year home prices are up 13%. Since December, home prices are up 8%. It is decelerating. But I think if you ask -- or you listen to most observers, and I think most people are calling for, if there is a correction, a modest one. So, my question is, how will the price discovery occur? And then second, is that price depreciation actually meaningful enough to change folks\u2019 spending behavior? Because as Ted said, if you\u2019re a homeowner, you\u2019ve done quite well from a balance sheet perspective. You likely have a job, you likely have cash in the bank. And then, we\u2019re seeing another just interesting dynamic where with mortgage rates increasing, our customer is becoming more and more likely to stay in place and begin a project, so improved in place. And so just sort of going back to the health of the homeowner back in over a decade ago, 25% of mortgages were underwater back then. Let\u2019s look at the credit standing of the housing stock in the U.S. now. Of owner-occupied households, 40% are owned outright, no mortgage. Of the 60% that do have a mortgage, 90% of those mortgages are fixed rate, 73% of those mortgages are fixed rate below 4%. So, we are now seeing a dynamic of stay in place and improve your home. And that\u2019s what our customers are telling us, and that\u2019s what the Pros are telling us their customers are telling them.\nSimeon Gutman: That\u2019s helpful. A follow-up on another very easy to forecast variable inflation. Can you frame maybe what percentage of your sales could be at risk from disinflation? Is it 100? Or it shouldn\u2019t be 100 because some parts of your product mix aren\u2019t going to be vulnerable?\nJeff Kinnaird: It\u2019s A - Jeff Kinnaird. We\u2019re watching inflation very carefully. We have seen some deceleration in inflation in the recent months, which is good for our consumers. But broadly, we are still experiencing some inflation in some specific categories. I\u2019ll call it the lumber market. We have seen a deflationary market in lumber over the recent weeks. In fact, we\u2019ve seen a lot of stabilization in that industry versus the prior two years. I did call out an impact from inflation in lumber for the quarter that was more representative of early days in the quarter. But we\u2019re looking at it carefully. We\u2019re managing category by category. We\u2019re working closely with our suppliers in terms of managing cost and cost components. We have a very good and deep understanding of virtually all cost components of all products that we sell. And again, we\u2019re managing it very closely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JP Morgan.\nChris Horvers: So, maybe to summarize your comments today, I guess, it\u2019s that you are incrementally more cautious because you\u2019re seeing certain categories maybe become slowing or more volatile but it\u2019s not dramatic and it\u2019s more the uncertainty of what the Fed\u2019s rate raising is going to affect the business in the future potentially?\nTed Decker: That\u2019s -- yes, I think that\u2019s a fair representation, Chris.\nChris Horvers: Okay. And then, -- so can you talk about some of the KPIs you\u2019re watching? I guess, what categories specifically are concerning you? Are you seeing DIY trade down? Are you seeing maybe unit trends in the project business slowing? It seems like the commodity inflation is driving some of your best project categories. And are you seeing any more sort of volatility from the consumer, I guess, over the past couple of months that is adding that element of caution?\nTed Decker: Well, I would say that the healthiest thing we see -- and as you can imagine, we look at every data set and by geography and category, et cetera. The healthiest thing about the business is the project nature of the demand. We are a project-oriented business and all the categories that Jeff called out that is driving that project demand remains incredibly strong. And we look at it with both our Pro customers, household Pros versus consumers, and that project demand remains strong with each of the Pro and the consumer. Some of the caution is -- and again, was it pull forward? Is it finally some price sensitivity on some of these whole good items? We\u2019ve talked about certain appliance categories or grills. Those definitely have come off the boil. And again, as everyone has purchased in the last three years, a lot of those categories, and they\u2019ve moved into more project and home improvement, or is there a reaction to inflation. That\u2019s what\u2019s a little harder to tease out. Here\u2019s a case in point. You look at our indoor garden business, two big categories, you might say, are more discretionary grills and patio. Grills was down. But patio, we had one of the strongest patio quarters that I can remember. So, there are definitely some mixed signals. It\u2019s definitely got our attention, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re cautious.\nChris Horvers: And I guess just following up, you talked about consistent three-year trends over the month. Obviously, October was an incredibly strong month last year. I guess is it -- was that just -- we\u2019ve heard a lot about the consumer shopping early last year and the holiday season is normalizing. To what extent do you think maybe the election has had an impact on the business in November? And just overall, how are you thinking about the positioning today and then into the holiday season?\nJeff Kinnaird: Look, we see some normalization back to 2019 in terms of the consumer trend. In the last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen pull forward in concerns of supply chain-driven shortages across retail. So, we do see potentially just the return back to more normal holiday spend by the consumer. As I commented in our prepared remarks, we feel very good about our Black Friday, our gift center, our decorative holiday assortments, and we\u2019re excited about the overall Black Friday season.\nRichard McPhail: And just in case you don\u2019t have the numbers in front of you, Chris, you called out monthly cadence. So really, our comps were consistent across the months, so not just a 3-year but also a 2-year basis. Just keeping in mind that last year\u2019s comps in August, September and October were 3 1, 4 5 and 9, 9 sequentially. So, if you look at a 2- or 3-year basis, maybe smoothing some of that out, the 1-year months don\u2019t tell you quite as much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi.\nSteven Zaccone: Congrats on the strong results. To follow up on Chris\u2019s commentary about the recent performance, has there been any impact from the hurricane recovery spend to call out maybe the end of the third quarter and thus far in 4Q?\nRichard McPhail: It was relatively minimal. So, we think we had about $120 million impact from hurricanes this quarter. But keep in mind, we were overlapping a similar amount from last year. So, these hurricanes and storm impacts extend across quarters. What we\u2019re more concerned about is the health and safety of our customers and our associates. And our minds and hearts are certainly with them right now.\nSteven Zaccone: A lot of discussion around the top line outlook given the housing uncertainty, but I wanted to focus on margin. I know there\u2019s not a target in place on a multiyear basis. But can you help us think through the levers to protect margin rate if sales growth were to weaken in the future? I guess, specific to gross margin, is there an opportunity for gross margin rate improvement as supply chain costs ease?\nJeff Kinnaird: We\u2019re managing margin closely, Steven. We look at it quarter-on-quarter. There\u2019s a lot of ins and outs when it comes to margin as we look forward.\nRichard McPhail: We -- look, I\u2019d just add that we think we have the tools and the experience and the people to manage pricing costs as well above than anyone else here. We\u2019ve proven that. Over the last three years, there\u2019s been a mix disruption, right, in our value chain. And yes, I think the proof is in the pudding when you look back at our history.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.\nScot Ciccarelli: So, I think everyone here kind of understands there\u2019s some uncertainty around the broader home improvement environment given what\u2019s happening with interest rates. But how are you guys thinking about the growth potential prospects of the large Pro business as we roll out to \u201823 because you guys will obviously have a lot more infrastructure and more relationships still at that stage?\nTed Decker: Thanks for the question, Scot. Actually we couldn\u2019t be more excited as we\u2019ve identified a $450 billion addressable market. And an understanding of what capabilities we need to deliver to get a larger share of wallet with that large Pro repair remodeler. I\u2019ve been here, as you may know, over 22 years, and we\u2019ve always known what we needed to do to capture or share of wallet with that Pro. And what\u2019s so exciting is that Hector and his team right now are actually building out the capability set to get more share of wallet with that large Pro. And as we build out these capabilities, introduce them to the customers, we\u2019re seeing the engagement and the incrementality of sales growth take off. And Hector, could give us a little more insight of what your building would be great.\nHector Padilla: Yes. Scot, just -- we continue to be super excited about the response from our Pros as we continue to enable capabilities to remove friction from our ecosystem. Very excited about the expansion of our outside sales resources and the growth of those customers are driving. We\u2019re seeing those customers grow, not just with direct sales with our outsized sales associates, but they\u2019re also engaging more on our digital platform and engaging more in our stores for that unplanned purchase. And as we continue to grow around other capabilities, whether it\u2019s in the B2B, digital platform, or in-store platform, we just continue to be super excited about the response of our Pros. And we are just removing friction. We are removing friction from all the different channels, and our customers continue to engage with us more and more.\nScot Ciccarelli: Is there a way to potentially size or at least for us to conceptually think about kind of what the potential revenue ramp is as these capabilities get filled out?\nRichard McPhail: As Ted said, we\u2019re excited. One of the reasons we\u2019re so excited because it\u2019s such a fragmented market, such a fragmented market of suppliers. And so, we just think the opportunity is exciting and tremendous and part of the excitement is it\u2019s hard to size.\nTed Decker: But I can say, I mean, we don\u2019t break out these numbers, but each of Pro and consumer grew again this quarter, and the Pro yet again grew meaningfully faster than the consumer. And our large Pro, the ones who are engaging with what Hector and team are developing, are growing the fastest yet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Overall transaction is down a little over 4%. I was wondering if you could pack that for us across the Pro and DIY customer base.\nTed Decker: I don\u2019t know if we break that out, but the strongest, again, was the large Pro.\nChuck Grom: Okay. All right.\nRichard McPhail: Look, I\u2019d say -- I mean, maybe the way to put it, too, is our Pros shop across our assortment. So you\u2019re going to sort of see similar dynamics, ticket transaction across the business, generally speaking. But, as said that the strength is with Pro.\nChuck Grom: Okay, makes sense. And then on the cost pressure front, as costs start to ease, how do you think about the pricing environment? Do you think you and peers are likely to hold on to prices as costs start to moderate and you retain that margin as a result, or are you likely to lower prices and try to maintain the same gross profit margin dollars?\nJeff Kinnaird: Chuck, we watch this very closely. We are the customer\u2019s advocate for value, and we watch the market and our competitors very closely. I will say that there has been an enormous shift to trading up to more innovation and more innovative products. We see that in our tool category. We see that in the outdoor garden business. We could see it across multiple categories. We still see that willingness to trade up for great value and great innovation.\nTed Decker: But -- and on the cost side, Chuck, it\u2019s definitely easing. So, you look at commodities, in particular, commodities have been down 6, 7 months in a row. Lumber is obviously way down from peaking at nearly $1,500 to now under $500 from peak to current during these last three years. However, we still see inflation across the store. So while some will be coming down in certain categories with costs and retails, our forecast at this point is that net inflationary cost pressures continue into 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: So, my first question, I think I want to ask that -- Chuck\u2019s question, maybe a little bit differently. But I mean, with regard to inflation, what we\u2019ve seen now for a while as Home Depot has done a remarkable job kind of strategically passing along inflation. So Ted, you\u2019ve mentioned a few times now you\u2019re starting to see some inflationary pressures ease. I guess, the question I have is, are you seeing or would you expect that as inflationary pressures ease, even if pricing doesn\u2019t necessarily slowly go down, you see some type of elasticity and demand meaning that unit demand would pick up in that type of environment?\nTed Decker: Well, it\u2019s a great question, and you could say, hey, if elasticities weren\u2019t as sensitive on the up, would they also likely not be on the moderation, if you will. It\u2019s to be determined. I think broadly, the price sensitivity wasn\u2019t as sharp as we expected the last two years. That\u2019s why we started each year more or less a flat forecast expectation and have beaten that each of the past two years. On certain commodities, lumber, copper wire, where we\u2019re pricing to market weekly, you see a much more classic reaction to price and unit productivity. With other categories, and I hate to bring up grills again. But there\u2019s some classic price points on some plastic grills. And when we saw those grills get up over $600, we saw a more dramatic drop off in engagement. And when Jeff and the team work those prices down even to the low-400s or high-400s, low-500s, you saw a response with unit productivity. Across the board, though, there has been -- and Jeff mentioned this, there has been so much innovation across our categories. If you think of the dramatic shift of outdoor power equipment in power tools, in appliances and what the features and benefits of these products are, the technology embedded in these products. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s quite an iPhone, but we\u2019re getting close to power tools being in that genre. And people love the newness and the innovation and they\u2019re albeit higher prices, but people are responding in buying. So, I think it\u2019s a mix, Brian, across the categories, and that\u2019s what Jeff and our merchant teams do such a great job managing every day.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow-up and a quick one, just for Richard, you gave us like the cadence of comps through the quarter, obviously, we saw the reiteration of guidance, but any commentary more specific on just the trend of business here into Q4?\nRichard McPhail: Nothing in the first two weeks of Q4 changes our view on 2022 guidance. And as we said, we expect comps to be positive in the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.\nZach Fadem: As you think about your DIY customers specifically and the well-documented challenges in the first half of the year, is it fair to say that your DIY customer improved on a one- and three-year basis this quarter? And as you think about consumer behavior in tighter economic and housing conditions ahead, is there a scenario where the DIY category outperforms Pro as customers trade down or maybe pull back on bigger projects?\nRichard McPhail: Zack, I may have to get you to repeat the second part of the question. On the first part of the question, look, we\u2019re really pleased with our consumer business through the year. Q1, we had what we always refer to as bathtub effect in some respects. And so, we had a seasonal impact to consumer in Q1 of this year. Q2 and Q3 have both been positive, and we\u2019re very happy with that business. Could you -- would you mind repeating the second part of your question?\nZach Fadem: Yes. Is there a scenario where DIY outperforms Pro as customers trade down or pull back on bigger projects?\nRichard McPhail: Well, I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any way to conjecture that. I do think that what we love about this business is it\u2019s all end customer demand regardless of the channel that appears through. But we are -- we don\u2019t have a target Pro penetration for the business. And what we\u2019ve seen through cycles is that, number one, we do very well with both. And you can see some fluctuation between the two. But really, what we have going right now is what we\u2019re observing, which is the Pro business is leading the Company that shows us that the demand for large projects is very healthy right now.\nTed Decker: And we -- someone asked this question before, I\u2019m not sure we answered it. We are not seeing trade down. If you take my grill or appliance example, it\u2019s not that people ultimately bought and they traded down. I think, it\u2019s that people have already purchased in the past few years. And when people do purchase, again, they\u2019re buying innovation. Our traeger business, for example, is incredibly strong as they bring out innovation, customers respond.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And when you think about your sixth straight quarter of transaction declines and the fact that there is a more stable repair and maintenance component of your business, to what extent do you believe we fully cycled away from all the pull-forward in excess discretionary category demand in 2020 and 2021? And when would you expect this to translate to a more normalized positive transaction cadence?\nTed Decker: Well, that\u2019s such a great question, and it\u2019s something we observe and build our theories of the case. When you go back now, what are we -- we\u2019re 11 quarters of this pandemic. And the first 5, 6, we had tremendous transaction growth, right? We all know the story of what happened. Not necessarily a lot of cost inflation at that point. And then, the last six quarters, we start to lap that tremendous activity but also saw for all the reasons we know, supply chain, commodities, global cost pressures, we saw significant cost in our business, and comps were driven as they were this past quarter with ticket over transactions. What we see now as you step back approaching three years is our transaction run rate, our sort of three-year CAGR at this point, is more or less pre-pandemic rates. And you could look at that at one hand and say, \"Wow, here\u2019s the slowdown.\" On the other hand, Richard used the term holding serve, you can look and say, oh my gosh, this industry erupted with demand for 1.5 years. Then it cycled significant cost increases, the customer hung in there and was resilient and your net over this three-year period up in transactions and units despite what we believe you\u2019ll hold on to these price levels. I think that all goes back to my opening comments of what is the dynamic of this overall industry and the health and the engagement level of this customer. And if we normalize from here, gosh, more than great. There\u2019s obviously all these questions about recession that we can\u2019t answer any better than you all can. But when you digest and look back on what\u2019s happened in the last three years, you\u2019d say, wow, that\u2019s a pretty incredible market segment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson.\nMike Baker: I appreciate the color you gave on the fourth quarter outlook. But -- you\u2019ve done such a great job improving your holiday business. In fact, in 10 of the last 13 years, your fourth quarter comp has been better than your third quarter comp. And by definition, that\u2019s occurring on tougher comparisons. Can you talk about what you\u2019ve done to make the fourth quarter such a bigger quarter for you? And why that might be different this year?\nJeff Kinnaird: Mike, it\u2019s Jeff. Yes, we\u2019ve had an exceptional fourth quarter. We\u2019ve -- in the past years, we\u2019ve built the business on the backs of decorative holiday. And we are the customer\u2019s advocate for value in that category, and we have great involution and again great value for our customers. Second, we\u2019ve built the business of gifting in our gift centers. And you look at the innovation that we\u2019re delivering to our Pro and to our consumer, it\u2019s exceptional. I spoke earlier about the M18 Milwaukee drill/driver combo kit, the innovation is just exceptional, as Ted talked to earlier. And then appliances. Appliances is an enormous category for The Home Depot. It\u2019s been a category that we\u2019ve built at an incredible rate. We\u2019re investing in capabilities like I spoke earlier, in terms of delivery. We\u2019re investing in dot-com capabilities, in terms of our customers\u2019 willingness to review and purchase online. Then, I\u2019d also say we\u2019re building a great project and business in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is a great time for a project. We see a lot of consumers eating, doing smaller projects around their home and getting ready for the holidays. And then finally, I\u2019d say, storage. Storage organization. We have an incredible storage event. We gain on the customer\u2019s advocate for value when it comes to storage across the business. And then finally, we\u2019ve built an incredible dot-com business. And this is -- we called out the performance in Q3. We\u2019re expecting a great Q4 with Cyber Monday and a big part of that is our digital performance, our app performance. I\u2019ve got Jordan Broggi here, our President of online. Jordan, do you want to make a couple of comments around the app?\nJordan Broggi: Yes, sure. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. I mean Ted called out at the front, the experience is what it\u2019s all about. We love the experience improvements we\u2019ve made. A lot of it\u2019s around in-store connectivity. We talked about store mode. We talked about military. We talked about loyalty. We\u2019ve got some features coming out on Pro for in-store checkout experience. And our customers really respond. I mean, we love the ratings in the App Store, 4.8 with Apple, 4.7 with Google, but we see it in our numbers as well, strong double-digit performance and growth in downloads and MAUs, monthly average users, in our traffic. It\u2019s our fastest-growing online property. We\u2019re got billions of dollars of sales through the app. We couldn\u2019t be more excited.\nMike Baker: Great. If I could ask one more follow-up. Your buyback did slow a little bit this quarter. Is that maybe a function of higher borrowing costs, or how should we think about buybacks going forward? Thanks.\nRichard McPhail: We don\u2019t ascribe to necessarily a smooth cadence of buybacks, and that will typically reflect just sort of how we think about working capital investment through the year and a cash buffer throughout the year. So, there\u2019s really nothing to read into that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with MKM Partners.\nDavid Bellinger: So, going back to some of the category comments. Are you seeing some evidence that the, call it, more discretionary items are turning lower and at a faster pace? I know last quarter, you mentioned some of those higher ticket $300, $400 Halloween items being pretty much as discretionary as it gets and performing pretty well. We saw some discounts on those items in the weeks preceding Halloween. So, any indications that those splurge items are starting to cool off and more quickly than the rest of the business?\nJeff Kinnaird: David, we had -- as I commented earlier, we had record sales, both in-store and online in Halloween that included the infamous Skelly, which has been one of our best sellers in terms of the innovation and value we offer our customers is really unmatched in the marketplace. And we couldn\u2019t be happier with our Halloween performance. If I turn to the fourth quarter, we\u2019re really excited about our decor holiday assortment. We\u2019ve got great innovation and great value for our customers across the assortment, if it\u2019s trees, if it\u2019s lights, if it\u2019s decorations, we feel very good about the category. And our consumers are reacting exceptionally well to it.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. I have a Skelly. So, I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about. My follow-up, just on the inventory levels. How much of that growth is aimed at Pro customers? So, is there a piece of that inventory that\u2019s not sitting in the stores? Maybe it\u2019s at facilities like in Dallas so that the number looks to be a bit more elevated to us at the store level. Just help us unpack the 25% inventory growth number and just get us comfortable that you aren\u2019t sitting on too much at this point, especially with some of the deceleration you\u2019re now seeing.\nRichard McPhail: Well, so look, investment in inventory and our One Supply Chain facility is certainly one of the factors in inventory growth year-over-year. But the primary factor is really just inflation as part of the inventory value. And then, we made strategic decisions to land inventory earlier in the year than we have prior. And really, just to give you some numbers around that and to reflect the fact, we feel fantastic about our inventory position. In Q2, we grew our inventory 38% year-over-year. In Q3, that number dropped to 27% year-over-year. And actually, if you look throughout our history, we actually typically build inventory from Q2 to Q3. In this case, our inventory actually came down by $400 million from Q2 to Q3. Our inventory is healthy, and we\u2019re happy with our position.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim.\nSteven Forbes: Maybe just a follow-up or focus on the quarterly performance. If I look at the press release, the selected sales data, obviously excludes HD Supply. So curious, Ted, if you can expand on the performance of that asset in today\u2019s backdrop as it looks like it may be driving some upside to the overall performance of the business.\nTed Decker: Yes. Steven, thanks. Yes, another great quarter for HD Supply. We mentioned this last quarter and they are just doing a terrific job. Shane O\u2019Kelly and his team are running the largest and the best focused MRO business for multifamily housing and hospitality, extended living, et cetera. We are -- remain well ahead of all our financial projections, and we made the acquisition. Their integration is tracking, they\u2019re integrating sales forces, customer records and now starting the work or on their way in the work of integrating the supply chain. So, that one has just been a terrific acquisition that we\u2019re super happy about.\nSteven Forbes: And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Richard or Ted. Given the performance, can you remind us on what percentage of sales that business is today? And then, as we look at the sort of spread between comp and net sales growth, any reason to think that the current sort of year-to-date spread doesn\u2019t hold into the fourth quarter?\nRichard McPhail: Well, we don\u2019t break HD Supply out. But as Ted said, we\u2019re so happy with it. On the difference between sales and comp, we\u2019ve always seen a gap there. It just comp reflect sales from the POS, sales reflects sales as they\u2019re actually delivered or installed. You\u2019re going to see that number there. We\u2019ll probably -- through the year, sales will be a little higher than comp guide, but the important guide here is comp because that\u2019s our activity-based metric around sales.\nOperator: Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-08-16 10:49:17", "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to The Home Depot Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are; Ted Decker, CEO and President; Jeff Kinnaird, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations Department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning. In the second quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly sales and earnings in our company's history. Sales for the second quarter were $43.8 billion, up 6.5% from the same period last year. Comp sales were up 5.8% from the same period last year, and our US stores had positive comps of 5.4%.  Diluted earnings per share were $5.05 in the second quarter up 11.5% from $4.53 in the second quarter of last year. From a geographical perspective, each of our 19 US regions delivered positive comps versus last year, while Mexico and Canada posted comps above the company average. The team has done a fantastic job serving our customers, while continuing to navigate global supply chain disruptions, inflation in a tight labor market. Our results in the second quarter reflect continued strong demand for home improvement projects. As Jeff will detail, the business was strong across our departments. While our seasonal business posted positive comps as spring broke in the second quarter, these categories underperformed our expectations for the first half of the year. This was more than offset by strength in project-related categories that outperformed our expectations. We also saw growth with both our Pro and DIY customers in the quarter and are encouraged that project backlogs remain healthy. While the business performed very well and our consumer remained resilient through the first half of the year, we are navigating a unique environment. We can't predict how the evolving macroeconomic backdrop will impact our customer going forward. However, we continue to closely monitor elasticities and trends across our respective categories and believe we have the tools, team and the experience to effectively manage in any environment.  Despite near-term uncertainties, we believe that the long-term underpinnings of demand for home improvement, remains strong and that we are well positioned to leverage our distinct competitive advantages to capitalize on compelling growth opportunities in our space. For the Pro customer, we continue to invest in the ecosystem of capabilities, including enhanced fulfillment, more personalized online experience, as well as other business management tools to drive deeper engagement with our Pro customers, and we believe our efforts are resonating. In May, we launched new capabilities on our B2B website to enhance the interconnected shopping and quoting experience for our Pros. In the past, our website was not integrated with our ordering and quoting systems, so an associate could not seamlessly modify an order, if a customer had questions or changes before placing the order. Our new interconnected capabilities remove friction for both pros and associates, allowing them to collaborate on orders, both in-store and online. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased 12% versus the second quarter last year. We also saw record downloads, traffic in sales via our mobile app. We continue to see improved conversion rates, as ongoing enhancements within our digital properties are resonating with our customers. Our team is focused on what is most important, our associates and customers. Our merchants, store and met teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter. Based on first half results, 100% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for hourly associates. I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Kinnaird: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the second quarter, we continued to see strong demand for home improvement projects and strong execution from our teams and supplier partners. Turning to our comp performance during the second quarter. All of our merchandising apartments posted positive comps. Building materials, plumbing, millwork, paint and hardware were all above the company average. Electrical, decor and storage, kitchen and bath, outdoor garden tools, appliances, indoor garden, lumber and flooring were positive, but below the company average. As you heard from Ted, while our seasonal businesses posted positive comps in the second quarter, they underperformed our expectations for the first half -- first half of the year, driven by categories like grills, fertilizers, chemicals and mowers. Keep in mind that we are up against very tough comparisons versus the last two years, and in these categories, when our customers focus on outdoor living and these are some of our best performing departments. During the second quarter, our comp average ticket increased 9% and comp transactions decreased 3.1%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by inflation across our product categories, as well as demand for new and innovative products. On a three-year basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive. Deflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket growth by 14 basis points during the second quarter, driven primarily by lower lumber prices. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up 11.6% compared to the second quarter of last year. We saw a big ticket strength across many Pro-heavy categories like pipe and fittings, gypsum and fasteners. During the second quarter, both Pro and DIY sales growth was positive, with Pro outpacing DIY. We're encouraged by the continued momentum we are seeing with our Pros and they tell us their backlogs remain healthy. During the quarter, we saw a robust project demand across the business. This can be seen in the double-digit comp performance of our building materials, plumbing and millwork departments as well as in certain project-related categories like fencing, siding, conduit boxes and fittings, tubs and showers and countertops. We continue to introduce new and innovative products aimed at simplifying the project, saving our Pros time and helping them take on more jobs. One example in building materials, where we launched nationally Henry's Tropi-Cool Roof Coatings. This new formula offers maximum reflectivity, helping reduce cooling costs. Henry's Tropi-Cool can be applied in any season, is 100% waterproof and rain-safe within 15 minutes of application. And this product is exclusive to the Home Depot in the big box channel. In bath, we're excited about the success we're having with our great assortment of Delta Tub & Shower wall combinations. Delta Classic 500 series is a simple tub or shower system that delivers a big transformation to a bathroom in a fraction of the time. It is easy to install and its acrylic surface makes it easy to clean. This series is exclusive to The Home Depot in the big box channel. Turning to our online sales. We are very pleased with the performance of our digital assets as we delivered the highest sales dollar volume in company history. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased 12% during the second quarter. This was driven by our continued investments, which are resonating with our customers, enhanced search capabilities and improved Pro site experience and more robust fulfillment capabilities help drive online conversion. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the second quarter, more than 50% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. As we look forward to the back half of the year, we remain committed to being our customers' advocate for value. Last quarter, we highlighted several new innovative products for our customers. This quarter, we're excited to announce the launch of Makita's new XGT 40-volt and 80-volt Max system of cordless equipment and tools in our outdoor power categories. The XGT system is engineered to achieve the optimum power required for heavier load applications without sacrificing run time. And these one-battery solution tools are exclusive to The Home Depot and the big box channel. We're also excited to build on the success of our Hubspace Smart Home platform, expanding our assortment across several categories such as door locks, lighting control, fixtures and ceiling fans. Hubspace makes it easier to set up and manage your smart home products and pairs well with voice-controlled operating systems. This platform is exclusive to The Home Depot. And in garage organization, we'll be rolling out our Milwaukee PACKOUT and RYOBI LINK wall systems, utilizing the same locking technology across the system that can be customized to meet your organizational needs from the workshop to the workplace. We're also excited about our lineup for Halloween. Our merchants have worked with our supplier partners to put together an expanded assortment of product offerings for this Halloween season. These products bring excitement to our stores and help drive traffic and our sneak preview of our Halloween lineup was a tremendous success. We are thrilled for the full rollout in the upcoming weeks. With that, I'll turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, total sales were $43.8 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion or 6.5% from last year. During the second quarter, our total company comps were positive 5.8% with positive comps of 5.2% in May, 4.9% in June and 7.1% in July. Comps in the US were positive 5.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 4.1% in May, 4.7% in June and 7.2% in July. In the second quarter, our gross margin was approximately 33.1%, a decrease of approximately 15 basis points from last year, primarily driven by supply chain investments. We continue to successfully offset significant transportation and product cost pressures while maintaining our position as the customer's advocate for value. During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 50 basis points to 16.6%. Our operating leverage during the second quarter reflects solid expense management for the quarter. Our operating margin for the second quarter was 16.5% compared to 16.1% in the second quarter of 2021. Interest and other expense for the second quarter increased by $58 million to $379 million, due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than one year ago. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.3%, up from 23.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $5.05, an increase of 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Our total store count at the end of the quarter was 2,316 and selling square footage was 240 million square feet. At the end of the second quarter, inventories were $26.1 billion, up $7.2 billion compared to the second quarter of 2021. Inventory turns were 4.5 times, down from 5.7 times last year. Approximately half of the year-over-year increase in inventory reflects product cost inflation. Our inventory also reflects deliberate investments and higher in-stock levels and pull forward of inventory for back half events in response to continued global supply chain disruption, investment in our new supply chain facilities and carryover of some spring seasonal inventory. Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $750 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.6%, up from 44.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Now, I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2022. As you heard from Ted, we are very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2022. We expect sales growth and comp sales growth of approximately 3% for fiscal 2022. We expect comp sales to be stronger in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. We expect our fiscal 2022 operating margin to be approximately 15.4% for the year. And we expect mid-single-digit percent growth in diluted we expect mid-single-digit percent growth in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2021. We find ourselves in a unique environment with many crosscurrents. We're operating in a broad-based inflationary environment not seen in four decades while managing through constrained global supply chain conditions, all against the backdrop of monetary policy shifts intended to moderate demand. We also see engaged and resilient homeowners who have strong balance sheets, consumers spending more time in their homes and continued structural support for home improvement project demand. We feel confident that we will continue to manage with flexibility through a dynamic environment, while growing faster than our market and delivering exceptional shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Are you seeing any signs that housing is having a negative impact on the business? Could it be that some of the seasonal performance that fell short of your expectation is a sign that some of the underlying challenges in housing are starting to leak its way into home improvement?\nTed Decker: Hey good morning Michael. We have not seen that yet. In fact, with the strong performance this quarter, the variability across our regions has been the lowest in markets, has been the lowest that we've seen in some time. So we all appreciate the headlines and follow those very closely. But we have not seen anything in our business yet from macro housing.\nMichael Lasser: Is there a case, Ted, where it's not evident in the business because you're generating a very healthy return on the investments that the Home Depot has made over the last couple of years? Perhaps you could frame this as what's going on in the Dallas market, which is where some of the distribution facilities and Pro efforts that have been in place for the longest versus what you've experienced in the rest of the market.\nTed Decker: Sure. And Michael we'll get to Dallas and Hector will take us through some of the things we're seeing with our Pro, which is incredibly strong. But what we're seeing overall in the business, the questions about housing and the economy, all very real questions, again, things we're following closely. But I mean we just couldn't feel better about our business. We just reported record quarterly sales and profits and reaffirmed our guidance, and that's on top of the $40 billion in growth in the past two years. We see a very engaged customer, each DIY and Pro. And as Richard said, though, we are operating in a unique environment with many cross currents inflation and interest rates and supply chain disruptions and the like. But given all that, our customer in our markets has been incredibly resilient. As Jeff said, project demand is incredibly strong. Our Pro in particular, is very strong and their backlog remains healthy. In DIY, we did see some seasonal weakness. But as we parse through that, it's difficult to say is that weakness in the seasonal businesses the overlap of the two prior incredibly strong years? Is it the weather where we had a really bad and late spring and then it turned incredibly hot across the country or are they fundamental demand pressures? Again, we have not seen a broad-based fundamental demand pressure in the business. So we couldn't be happier with the overall business, watching it very closely. And I can just say, as I said in my comments, Michael, whatever comes, we are an agile business, an experienced management team, and we look to take share in any environment. And Hector, if you can give some color on overall Pro and specifically Dallas would be great.\nHector Padilla: Yeah. And Michael, as you know, we're building a unique interconnected Pro ecosystem to capture more of that Pro planned purchase. To serve our Pros, it's really about removing friction through a multitude of enhanced product offerings and capabilities, and it all starts with brand assortments and job lot quantities. And as you know, these new supply chain assets allow us to do that at a different level. But it also includes digital tools and personalized experience, a multitude of fulfillment options for reliable delivery, our Pro extra loyalty tool and other value-added offerings such as credit, tool rental, Quotecenter. And for our larger Pros, we have to serve them with a single point of contact, hence where we're expanding our onsite sales team and building an inside sales team. And I will tell you specifically to Dallas, Dallas is the most advanced market and is performing extremely well. We're thrilled to see our Pros trying our capabilities or growing their spend quarter-over-quarter. And I will share with you that other top markets for us are markets where we have the new supply chain assets, and other part of ecosystem live.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much and good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning, everyone. Hope you're good. I wanted to ask an oldie, but goodie on the reversion given the significant gains that have occurred post-COVID. One of the ways that we've been looking at it suggests that most of the unit reversion is basically in the base. So we've kind of rebaselined a significant part of the business in 2022 and that it opens the door to growing next year. I'm not asking for any endorsement on 2023, but curious how you're looking at this reversion question and anything interesting on units as you look at it?\nRichard McPhail: Well, Michael -- sorry. Sorry, Simeon. It's a good question. I think though, we have to return to Ted's commentary that the consumer, our customer, consumer in Pro has been more resilient than we even expected at the beginning of the year. When we expect -- when we issued guidance at the very beginning of the year, we assumed that we'd see ticket growth driven by inflation and really sort of a like-for-like offset in transaction, we haven't seen that. And so that led to our increased guidance in Q1 of a 3% comp. We've reaffirmed that guidance today. It does assume some level as -- it assumes that inflation persists at current levels and that we may see a slightly greater offset in transactions through the year. But it's a conservative assumption and not really based on observation right now. So the consumers and customer are resilient.\nTed Decker: And, Simeon, we've been watching, obviously, all those metrics in PCE and share on goods and share on services and clearly, the US consumer has reengaged in activities outside the house and travel is incredibly strong, right now, in eating out, in hospitality. So there has been the movement in PCE to services as we thought. But home improvement, in particular, has been, again, just incredibly strong, as Richard laid out, which led us to increase our guidance from what was essentially flat at the start of the year to the 3% we just affirmed. But we just don't -- we don't see a slowdown from that and remain incredibly bullish about the engagement level. It's really all the dynamic of the home improvement. Again, so many cross-currents in the economy, but when you think of the wealth that our core customers and their home equity up $9-odd billion, the excess savings rates, the strong jobs and earnings growth of wages and the fact that we're just continuing to spend more time at home in general, people are still super engaged in improving that home that they're spending more time in. So we're certainly benefiting from that longer-term dynamic.\nRichard McPhail: And, I think, there's an emerging interesting dynamic that kind of pushes against reversion. And you think about those who may have looked to move into another house a few years ago, we're looking at their fixed rate mortgage and saying, I like that mortgage, I like my equity position in my home. I'm going to stay in place and remodel. We see that in the survey data where customers say their intent is to do projects of all sizes is still very high.\nSimeon Gutman: Yes. And my follow-up, I think, Ted and Richard, you basically answered it. I was going to ask why you think the backlogs are still so healthy, because looking at the other high-ticket spending across the consumer complex, a lot of it is contracting and yet you're basically saying, we're not really seeing that or expecting it. I think it's partly the vibrancy of the housing market, to your point. I don't know if it's income cohort, but if there's anything else, because you mostly answered it in the response to the last question, but curious if there's more.\nRichard McPhail: Our customer skews heavily homeowner. Our Pros spend on behalf of homeowners and our DIY customers, over 90% of that sales is to a homeowner. And as Ted said, when you look at the wealth creation over the last two years home price appreciation of almost 40%, our customer is just in a really good place right now. And I think that also carries over to income, if you were to take a look at real purchasing power of our customer, it compares favorably.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. So at the sake of asking, I guess, a shorter-term question here, it's hard not to notice that July sales ticked up a couple of hundred basis points on a stack basis. And I guess I'm wondering, would you guys point to anything specific, be it weather, the slight easing we've seen in interest rates or gas prices? Any kind of color on that might be helpful.\nTed Decker: Yes. Scot. Good morning. On a three-year basis, it's more or less stable. So July had a relatively easier compare. But I will say, one thing we have noticed because our strength has continued into Q3 here in the first couple of weeks. We think -- again, I mentioned PCE and people traveling and service spending going up. And as people have come back, particularly in the South, we start school very early down here early August. And as people, including Pros, came back from vacations -- we saw it in the acceleration of the business midway through July, and that has continued into August. I think people are back home and home from the beach, the mountains, et cetera and back engaging in home improvement projects.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. That's helpful. And then just can you size the adverse impact on seasonal in the first half? Obviously, it came a little short of expectations. Is there a way to provide a magnitude of that for us?\nRichard Mcphail: We -- as Ted said, we're accustomed to offsets in our business and we look at home improvement demand in total. And so as we said, we met expectations. There's always -- we never had a quarter exactly the way we think we are, but we feel great about the demand that we saw out there.\nScot Ciccarelli: Thanks, guys\nTed Decker: Thank you.\nRichard Mcphail: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question. \nStephen Zaccone: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Ted, I was just hoping we could revisit your comments about the macro backdrop. Are you concerned there could be a lag in the sense that demand could slow over time? Because in the past, you've looked at home price appreciation as a key factor for home improvement demand. You're concerned that home prices could stay flattish or potentially decline from here and does that alter your view on the demand outlook for the near to medium term?\nTed Decker: So it hasn't as of yet. And this is the what we're seeing. I mean we talk about home price appreciation, transactions, household formation, et cetera, multiple inputs on housing but the strongest and most correlated for our sales is home price appreciation. Now that's gone up, as Richard said, 30%, 40% in the last couple of years, which we believe, translates to high $8 trillion, $9 trillion of increased wealth with what is our core customer base. So when mortgage rates touched at 6% there for a minute, certainly, you saw new home construction in mortgage rates feel that immediately. If we have a couple of years of holding serve, if you will, on this incredible price appreciation in the home, we don't see that impacting demand. The fact that we're not going up year after year after year is less the point that we've gone up so much in the past two years and the equity position in these homes are so strong coupled again with people spending more time in their homes, so repair and remodel, demand is going to increase from wear and tear. You're going to want more space and just improvements in the home because you're there more often. And then the fact that the US home stock is aging, and of course, it ages every year, but it's aging disproportionately because we had so many of those years or we underbuilt in housing. So now we have well over half the homes in the United States over 40 years old. So all those factors with that incredibly strong run-up in value, we think supports home improvement for some time to come, regardless if you have appreciation beyond these levels in the near-term. And we never thought or saw home price appreciation correlated period-to-period that we've always seen and heard there's a lag effect there that stretches over multiple periods. So as Ted said, we think fundamentals here are strong.\nStephen Zaccone: Great. Very helpful. Just a quick follow-up on inventory levels. Maybe how much is inventory up on a unit basis, if you could share. And do you feel like you're at the right level of in-stocks in the business now?\nJeff Kinnaird: Good morning, Stephen, it's Jeff Kinnaird. From an inventory perspective, we are -- if you look at our total inventory, half of that is inflation as we manage through this inflationary environment. Second is just in-stock improvement, to your point, we're happy with our improvement, our merchants, our supply chain team, our suppliers have worked hand-in-hand in building a better in-stock this year versus last year. We still have a ways to go in terms of improvement, but very happy with our -- where we -- how we progress. You know, we are still having to pull inventory forward. If you think about today's supply chain environment, our focus is to be there for our customers, to be there for our pros in terms of the right job lock quantities and the right timing of events and other activities. So part of our inventory overage is obviously due to that work in terms of being there for our customers. We do have some carryover inventory from the spring season, but it is really low-risk inventory that we're managing through and ensuring that we're ready for next season. But overall, we feel very good about our in-stock position. We're managing the inflation of our environment in inventory and will be there for our customers in terms of in-stock.\nStephen Zaccone: Thanks very much. Best of luck in the back half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter, congratulations.\nTed Decker: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: So I have a couple of questions. First off, historically, having followed Home Depot now for a long time, your company has done a very good job so to say, understand the macro inputs and building a model and then forecasting your own sales off of that. So the question I have is -- this is somewhat, I know a follow-up on some of the prior questions. But as you -- with your models right now. I mean you look at the various variables out there, the various macro factors, is your business tracking consistent with where it should be, or you actually -- is there some type of break where you're actually performing better right now than the macro variables would dictate?\nRichard McPhail: I think, Brian, we're in such a unique environment that to try to build models off of macroeconomic factors is probably less valuable than spending our time managing in an agile way. What we are confident in is that we've been taking market share consistently and that we are positioned now better than ever to take market share in any environment. As Ted said earlier, we've watched the same housing statistics for over a decade now. And we think directionally, we understand what's going on here. There's just a very positive environment with respect to the homeowner. But we're not going to, at least at this moment, given the dynamism in the economy tied to any given macroeconomic factor.\nTed Decker: Yeah, Brian, if I can add to that, on, are there any parts of the business doing better than we expected. I mean, we truly are just thrilled with what we're doing with the Pro as Hector outlined. This Pro ecosystem that, we're building I mean, we are truly building a set of capabilities that is not seen in our marketplace. And in talking to our Pros and the research we did, they are more than comfortable to do more with Home Depot as we develop capabilities to serve their larger plan purchase. And Hector talked specifically about Dallas, but it's different parts of this Pro ecosystem come online, we have a number of one supply chain buildings now open in many large metro markets, we're starting to increase the size of the sales force, our quoting capabilities and integration of our B2B website, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, all of this is really coming together to drive what is that incredibly strong Pro and larger Pro comp. So as we updated our TAM to $900 billion earlier this year with $450 million of that being in Pro, we just see tremendous opportunity. And I would say, yes, that is a category that we are outperforming and happy for it.\nBrian Nagel: That's great, very, very helpful. And then the follow-up question I have, unrelated. But with regard to inflation, so once again, inflation has been a driver of your business. I guess the question I have is, are you seeing any incremental evidence that the consumer is starting to push back somewhat on these higher price points?\nJeff Kinnaird: Brian, we are \u2013 we have higher average unit retail growth, and that's higher than inflation. So really not seeing any trade down, we've got strength in our ticket above $1,000 and that speaks to the project into the Pro customer. We will say in categories like grills, mowers, laundry and a few other bigger ticket items, it's possible there is a price sensitivity. But as Ted commented, there's COVID pull forward, there's stimulus effect. We went from a very wet and cold spring to a very hot summer in the majority of our markets. And the consumer is focusing on other projects. You think about that consumer has shifted. You think of the last year, it was all about the backyard. This year, it's about categories like paint and other large renovation categories, and we're seeing that across our business. Then I'll also say, we continue to see the consumer and the Pro trade up around innovation, and I couldn't be more proud of the merchants and our supplier partners and what we delivered around innovation for our customers. We've got a lot of products helping our Pros finish the job faster and simplifying the project for our consumer. So, no significant trade down taking place.\nBrian Nagel: Appreciate. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So a follow-up question on the Pro. Can you talk about the sort of the relative performance amongst the large Pro versus the smaller Pro? Is the large Pro outperforming? What would you attribute to that? And then overall, I'm not sure, if you can track this, but are you seeing Pro transaction growth, because overall transaction growth is ground down, presumably, that was DIY?\nA - : Yeah. Chris, I will share with you that is the performance of our high spend Pro has been very consistent over the last several quarters. So we're very pleased to see that. We're seeing other areas of our Pro business as far as the customer size accelerate quarter-over-quarter. So we just feel really good. We spent a substantial amount of time with them talking about backlogs, and we feel very good about where they're positioned for the next couple of quarters.\nChris Horvers: So, sorry, just to interpret. So, you're saying that large Pro has been the best performer?\nRichard McPhail: Our large Pros were the best performers this quarter. That's right, Chris.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then are you able to look at it on a transaction level were transactions up for the Pro?\nRichard McPhail: We're not going to break that out any further, but let's just say that demand is strong with the larger professional customer.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then the follow-up on that sort of, Ted, your point on people came back from vacation and have reengaged in the category. Last year that seemed to happen more in the September time frame where DIY reengaged. How are you thinking about the DIY business into the fall versus maybe people come back and there are some things that need to get done and the kids are going back to school? But how do you think about the risk on DIY maybe fading as we get into September and the fall?\nTed Decker: Well, Chris, that's a great question. And frankly, when we -- given the strong first half and the strong second quarter, to reaffirm guidance, which implies a lower comp in the second half, that's really the question for us. And frankly, we don't know the answer. We're super comfortable with Pro; that continues to motor on. But the question for the second half and the opportunity to do better than that implied comp is if the consumer hangs in there. As Jeff said, of the various potential reasons for seasonal relatively underperforming in the first half, if it's things more like weather, and having focus for so long in the backyard for two years if they went and did other things, go to the beach, et cetera. And then they get back in the fall and reengage, that will obviously be great news. But with these crosscurrents, we just haven't called that. And that's a little bit of conservatism in the second half.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thanks very much. Best of luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Hey, thanks. Just to kind of build off Chris\u2019 question. I'm just curious how you're planning the business from a category perspective over the next couple of quarters and maybe into early 2023. And is it your expectation that Pro continues to lead, or do you think that what you've seen over the past few weeks that we start to see maybe a shift on that front?\nJeff Kinnaird: Chuck, good morning. Look, we are prepared for the continuation of the project customer when it comes to innovation and value. I point at Halloween and how we launched Halloween a few weeks ago and saw just great success in the early launch, and we'll set in stores in the upcoming weeks and look forward to that category performing. When it comes to the Pro, we'll be there in terms of innovation and job-lock quantities and leveraging our supply chain capabilities and the other capabilities that Hector spoke to. So planning the continuation of the project business, the Pro business, and we'll be there for our consumer when it comes to Labor Day, coming up in a few weeks. We've got a great program planned for Labor Day, as we move through Halloween, as we head in the Black Friday timeframe, we'll be there for our customers with great value. And we'll continue being the advocate for value for our customers.\nTed Decker: Yeah. Chuck, it's interesting on something like Halloween, it's not a huge category. It's not going to move the needle on $150 billion in sales per se. But the level of excitement that, that category brings to us in the traffic. And when you think about resilience to the customer and willingness to spend on clearly discretionary items, we had two releases of some of that product, very, very specific limited quantities leading up to this period. And we sold out in -- I don't even know if it was ours, how quickly people are spending $300-odd for a clearly discretionary item, but a lot of fun, great innovation in value, but clearly, people snapped up in minutes, a pretty decent price point 100% discretionary item.\nChuck Grom: That's obviously good to hear. Just switching gears a little bit to the next couple of years. Just wondering if you guys can discuss the new facilities that you've opened up across the country and the benefits you're seeing, you touched on it in Dallas a little bit. But how much of a tailwind can that be over the next couple of years as you largely complete that rollout?\nRichard McPhail: Yeah, I'll start off. Our supply chain is an important component of the ecosystem that we're building to serve our customers and drive productivity. And our intent is really to build the fastest, most efficient and reliable delivery network in home improvement reaching 90% of households with a same-day, next-day service on parcel and big and bulky. Our original plan was to open up 150 new buildings. And while many of these will be complete by the end of this year, some are going to take us a little bit longer, and that's a function of our HD Supply acquisition, which we paused and reevaluated our needs in facilities that serve similar capabilities as well as some of the impact that we had associated with COVID. We're very pleased with the performance of the buildings. We've got about 85 of our 100 planned market delivery operations. We've got 11 of our planned DFC expansions, and those facilities will serve bulk of parcel in the big and bulky customer in local markets. And then lastly, and Hector referenced this, our flatbed distribution centers that will finish the year with about 15 or half of our intended goals are right on track. And Dallas was the first market that we stood up these capabilities. It's been operational for over two years. And we really like what we're seeing out of that ecosystem in the Dallas market that Hector mentioned. We're learning a great deal and we're winning that Pro plan purchase. And so we're excited about the possibilities that remain with our investment and our One Supply Chain strategy.\nTed Decker: Chuck, you asked what do we think tailwinds are as we build this out and John mentioned, HD Supply is part of a pivot on what we were building for one supply chain. I'd like to -- I\u2019ll just say that, we couldn't be happier with the HD Supply acquisition. Shane O'Kelly and his team are just doing a terrific job. That integration is going incredibly well on product catalog, on customers and sales force integration, and they are just off to a great start and that business is performing incredibly well. Remember, we put together the number one and two multifamily players and have a leading position in multifamily. And then with the supply acquisition picked up additional verticals in hospitality and healthcare, government, et cetera, all of them are doing incredibly well, and we couldn't be happier with HD Supply.\nChuck Grom: Thanks Ted.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. Ted, Jeff, I was hoping to expand on the Pro loyalty program and the B2B website experience, really looking for any specific data points you can provide to help us better understand the maturation benefits of these initiatives? Like how many members do you have? How often are they engaging in the personalized offers? What's happened to sort of average wallet share of the Pro post onboarding? Is there anything you can provide us to help us understand the opportunity here?\nJordan Broggi: Thanks for the question. This is Jordan Broggi from the online team. We don't break those out. But what I would say is, we're super happy with our loyalty customers. They are outperforming the average and the customers that are logged into our B2B experience, online outperformed pretty significantly to customers on our consumer side. And Steve -- I'm sorry.\nTed Decker: So I'll just jump in on Pro Xtra as well. Just thrilled with the second year in terms of performance. We linked our Pro Xtra loyalty to our commercial credit cards this past spring. That's been another leap forward in terms of overall performance. We see great existing member engagement. We see great new sign-ups. And the enrollments are strong and the revenue is strong. And then our Pros are engaging in the perks and we are seeing significant growth in that level of engagement.\nSteven Forbes: And then -- and just a quick follow-up, maybe for Richard. I think Ted mentioned that 100% of the stores qualified for Success Sharing. Any color on how that payment compared to last year or, I guess, to the original plan for the year, as we think about the expense build?\nRichard McPhail: It was roughly equivalent to last year.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Baker: Hi, guys. So I just wanted to ask, a lot of moving parts, obviously, in the environment, but through it all, it looks like, at least according to your guidance, you guys are going to comp at about 3% with flattish operating margins. Is that the right way to think about the business longer-term? Is that where you sort of target the comp and the margin breakeven at about 3%, you'd be breakeven, something above that, maybe margins go up, et cetera. Just wondering about the long-term view.\nRichard McPhail: We -- thank you for the question. We typically lever operating expenses into the very low single-digit comp. And we would always expect to do so, leveraging operating expense is a part of our financial model and been a part of how we do business. You're going to see fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter, but we've met expectations this year and feel great about where we sit and how our teams have managed through this environment. Longer-term, again, we expect to generate operating expense leverage. Our goal though here is to gain market share and deliver shareholder value. And we think about delivering shareholder value in terms of driving operating profit dollar growth. That's a formula that's worked for us, and we think it's going to keep working for us.\nMike Baker: And so if I could follow-up on that, what that sounds like to me, both of those comments leverage operating expenses, but focus on gross profit dollars. Is it fair to say, you're willing to let gross margins continue to tick down? I think they've been down something like six of the last 10 quarters in each of the last couple of years, not by much, just by 10 to 20 basis points a year. But is that the idea that we're okay with gross margins ticking down a little bit as long as it's driving comp and leveraging the SG&A?\nRichard McPhail: We -- thank you for the question. Again, we think about dollar growth and we think about cash-on-cash returns, first and foremost. I think gross margin, in particular, is kind of a secondary metric. I'll give you an example. Over 10 years ago, we identified appliances as a category where we had a major competitor who is losing steam and where we thought we could make some inroads. The question at the time was that gross margin on appliances carried a gross margin that was below company average. But the return on invested capital given that model, where we really don't own the inventory in the model, the return on invested capital was fantastic. And so as we look back, that appliances impact on our business, we would say we do that again every single time. We will look for opportunities to drive market share, drive operating profit dollar growth and drive return on invested capital.\nMike Baker: Perfect. Makes sense. Thanks for the color.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem : Hey, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on your Dallas market as performance seems to be tracking at or above your expectations. And now that you've had some time for your supply chain and facility investments to resonate, is there any quantification you can share in terms of comp lift for the market, new customer wins or wallet share gains versus the overall fleet?\nHector Padilla: Look, we're not going to break down the specific performance for Dallas. But again, I would tell you that Dallas has been towards the top of our performance when it comes to the Pro segment of our business. We're seeing just great reaction and engagement from our customers, and those who are trying our capabilities are repeating purchases with us and those baskets continue to grow. So, we're excited to continue to enhance the ecosystem. We just expanded,, for the second time, our outside sales resources and those team members are doing great or servicing our Pro customers. So, we're just very encouraged about what we're seeing in Dallas and other markets. But again, it's just -- it's early in the transformation, early in the build-out of the ecosystem but great signals coming back from our customers. And they really want to consolidate their purchases. When you think about our Pro customers coming to our stores over 60 times a year and then having to go to other retailers for complements of their projects, we can serve those needs to our Pro customers and they want to consolidate other purchases with us.\nTed Decker: And Zach, if I can add, I've mentioned this before, and we have another quarter of this tracking as we look at the size of the Pro, and we have a pretty good breakdown of they're buying small item emergency infill versus a larger plan purchase days out that's delivered. And then you look at the various capability sets that we're building, what you'd hope to see, expect to see is exactly what we're seeing as these Pros engage in the capabilities. So, they get a sales, a dedicated professional sales resource. They joined our credit program. They've joined our loyalty program. They rent tools. They use our larger quoting systems, they take delivery. As they engage with more capabilities, we're seeing larger purchases. We're seeing more repeat purchases. Again, everything you'd sort of map out is what would you want to see to demonstrate that this is working, that's exactly what we're seeing. So, we couldn't be happier. It's a journey. As we've said, Dallas is the market that is most established, but we're in many metro markets right now with different levels of these capabilities. And we do look at Dallas very specifically, and we look at incrementality and we know exactly what we need to drive an NPV-positive project, even to add an incremental sales force. Single individual sales rep, we're tracking incrementality of sales to make sure we're paying for that resource. But this whole ecosystem, again, working in the different -- many different markets now with different levels of capabilities built is what is behind this incredible performance with the Pro and the large Pro in particular. I mean it's not by accident that we're growing our Pro the way we're growing them.\nHector Padilla: And Zach, it's Hector again. The only thing I will add is that think about the last project that you engage with, every Pro planned purchase pulls a lot of unplanned purchases for that same project and also advanced order pickup. And we're seeing that. We're seeing the customer not only go after the large deliver product, but also coming back to restore for that unplanned purchase to complete the project. So the ecosystem is really working well.\nZach Fadem: Got it. That's all helpful. And I just wanted to ask with the recent leveling out of CPI and also the step down in your commodity basket. If you could just talk through the impact here as your freight or input costs start to moderate. Is it fair to say that you'll immediately pass that savings on to your customers, or do you view the majority of recent price increases more or less sustainable?\nJeff Kinnaird: Hi Zach, yes, we manage a large portfolio of goods. We do a lot of work on competitive pricing analysis and will stay competitive in the market. And I will also say, we have a deep understanding of almost all cost components for almost all of the products that we sell. And we're working with our suppliers on what it looks like when we see commodities fall off. As you said, there's been a fall off on the broader commodity index. We're watching that very closely, and we will certainly maintain our competitiveness in the market as we watch what takes place with commodities in the short and in the midterm here.\nZach Fadem: Thanks for the time.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of David Bellinger with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Bellinger: Hey, thanks for getting me on. A couple of quick ones. So you mentioned a slower pace of sales implied in the back half to get to the 3% comp for the year. So, how should we think about operating expense growth in relation to sales growth in both Q3 and Q4? Any specific measures you're taking to get better leverage on cost after the nice results in Q2? And just remind us, if you can, just how much of the expense structure is tied to payroll and your ability to flex that up or down in real time?\nRichard McPhail: We -- taken in reverse order, we don't break out our percentage of payroll to sales, other it is our largest operating expense, and we manage it very closely. With respect to the remainder of the year, I really just point you to our guidance. You're going to have variability quarter-to-quarter in operating expense leverage, but we feel great about at least where we think the year is heading. And again, I point you to guidance with respect to what we anticipate.\nDavid Bellinger: Okay. And then just one other one. Can you talk about the share buyback outlook, just given where Q2 numbers have landed, any potential share repurchase acceleration? We've got this potential 1% added tax coming January 1. Just any change on the buyback?\nRichard McPhail: There's no change in our capital allocation philosophy or approach. We will continue to return excess cash to shareholders.\nOperator: Ms. Janci, I'd now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thanks, Christine, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call in November.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-05-17 13:03:05", "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to The Home Depot First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine and good morning everyone. Welcome to Home Depot\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, CEO and President; Jeff Kinnaird, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thank you, Isabel and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call this morning. Fiscal 2022 is off to a strong start. Sales for the first quarter were $38.9 billion, up 3.8% from the same period last year. Comp sales were up 2.2% from the same period last year, and our U.S. stores had positive comps of 1.7%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.09 in the first quarter, up 6% from $3.86 in the first quarter last year. The strong performance in the quarter is even more impressive given the robust performance we were comparing against last year. A year ago, we delivered the highest first quarter sales in company history as we benefited from outsized demand for home improvement goods, favorable weather and government stimulus. This year, we achieved a new high watermark for first quarter sales as strong demand for home improvement goods continued despite a slower start to spring in many parts of the country. Delivering such strong results on top of last year\u2019s historical growth is a testament to our orange-blooded associates. They are maintaining their relentless focus on our customers while continuing to navigate the ongoing pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, inflation and a tight labor market. We are also thankful for the strength of our relationships with our supplier and transportation partners. Our respective teams are working tirelessly to flow product to stores in distribution centers as quickly and efficiently as possible. I would like to thank them for their ongoing support as we continue to navigate a challenging and dynamic environment. The demand seen in the first quarter exceeded our expectations. The home improvement consumer remains engaged. Customers continue to tell us that their homes have never been more important and project backlogs are very healthy. We believe that the medium to longer term underpinnings of demand for home improvement have never been stronger. We are thrilled with our Pro performance in the quarter driven by underlying strength in project demand. We continue to invest in an ecosystem of capabilities, including enhanced fulfillment options, a more personalized online experience as well as other business management tools to drive deeper engagement with our Pro customers. And we believe our efforts are resonating. We are navigating a unique environment, but we believe we have the tools, the team and the experience to effectively manage through. While we don\u2019t know how inflation might impact consumer behavior going forward, we are closely monitoring elasticities in customer trends across our respective categories and geographies and remain encouraged by the underlying strength we see in the business. Jeff will provide a bit more color about what we have observed from a category and big ticket standpoint in a moment. And while inflation impacted our average ticket increase this quarter, it wasn\u2019t the only impact. As we have seen over the past several years, our customers continue to trade up for premium innovative products. In March, we held an in-person store manager meeting for the first time in 3 years. One of the many highlights of that week is our Product Walk, where vendors showcased the latest in product innovation. And what I can share with you is that the level of innovation across the business is robust. In fact, almost 90% of the products on display this year are entirely new SKUs to The Home Depot. So, the pipeline for innovative products remains very strong. Beyond product and innovation, my biggest takeaway from the store managers\u2019 meeting is how energized the team is. The exceptional execution our associates delivered over the last few years hasn\u2019t been easy, but our teams have consistently risen to the challenge. We frequently survey our associate base and are pleased that engagement and morale remain high. Last quarter, we talked about our customer-backed approach to remove friction at every touch point of the shopping experience. To that end, we recently announced that Matt Carey has been named Executive Vice President of Customer Experience. In this newly formed role, Matt will partner across the business to help design and develop new and innovative solutions to drive a seamless experience for our customers. As Matt transitions to this new role, we also announced that Fahim Siddiqui has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer, where he is responsible for all aspects of our technology development and strategy. These moves will help drive further alignment around our interconnected retail strategy, which will allow us to enhance what we believe is the best experience in home improvement. Richard will talk to you in a few minutes about our guidance for the remainder of the year, but the first quarter certainly got us off to a great start. We are also encouraged by the continued strength we see in the business through the first two weeks of the second quarter as spring is breaking more broadly across the U.S. Our team continues to focus on what is most important: our associates and customers. Our merchants, store and met teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter. I\u2019d like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Kinnaird: Thank you, Ted and good morning everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the first quarter, we continued to see outsized demand for home improvement projects and strong execution from our teams and supplier partners. Turning to our comp performance during the first quarter, 11 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by plumbing, building materials, millwork and paint. During the first quarter of this year, we saw double-digit negative comps in our seasonal departments due to the late arrival of spring. Appliances posted slightly negative comps. Adjusting for a shift in event timing, appliance comps would have been positive for the quarter. Excluding seasonal categories, we are thrilled with the broad-based strength across the business and healthy project demand. During the first quarter, our comp average ticket increased 11.2% and comp transactions decreased 8.4%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by inflation across several product categories as well as demand for new and innovative products. Comp transactions reflect the late start to spring and the anniversarying of stimulus. And on a 2 and 3-year basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive. Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 240 basis points during the first quarter, driven by inflation in lumber, copper and billing materials. Lumber prices remained volatile during the quarter. As an example, framing lumber peaked at approximately $1,300 per 1,000 board feet during the first quarter before falling over $400 to approximately $900. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up 12.4% compared to the first quarter of last year. We saw big ticket strength across many Pro-heavy categories like pipe and fittings, gypsum and fasteners. During the first quarter, Pro sales growth outpaced DIY. On a 3-year comp basis, both growth with our \u2013 growth with both our Pro and DIY customers was consistent and strong. We\u2019re encouraged by the momentum we are seeing with our Pros, and they tell us that their backlogs are strong. And during the quarter, we saw many of our customers turn to Pros to help them with larger renovation projects. This can be seen in the double-digit comp performance of our building materials and flowing departments as well as in certain kitchen and bath categories like in-stock kitchens, tubs and showers and countertops. We also saw double-digit growth in our kitchen and bath installation business. This underscores the strength of project demand we are seeing across the business. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased 3.7% during the first quarter. We are very pleased with the performance of our digital assets as we delivered the highest sales dollar volume in our company history. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the first quarter, more than 50% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. As you heard from Ted, we are very excited about the innovation we are introducing across the business. We continue to lean into products that simplify the project, saving our customers time and helping them take on more jobs. One example is our Viega ProPress line of plumbing. Your plumbers can create a water-tight copper connection in 60% less time than a traditional copper solder job. Viega ProPress fittings require no flame and work in wet applications. Viega is the market leader in this space and is exclusive to The Home Depot in the big box channel. In paint, working with Masco and PPG, we have put together a formidable Pro paint lineup that is resonating with our Pro painters. Masco\u2019s bare-formulated, Pro-specific offering continues to perform well in our stores. And in the first quarter, we added PPG Speed High series. This Pro-specific paint that is specced in the vast majority of multi-housing large commercial jobs, giving us an entry point with our Pro painter for larger scale projects. And this is now exclusive to The Home Depot in the big-box channel. In spray paint, we launched PPG\u2019s GlitonMaxFlex spray paint. PPG\u2019s proprietary industrial-based technology is uniquely flexible, covering and preserving their original look and feel of a wide range of services, including leather and fabric. And with Masco, we have expanded their exclusive offerings to spray paint, Cox and sealants as well as interior stains. Now, let\u2019s turn our attention to spring and the exciting lineup of products we have for our customers. We are thrilled to showcase our new product offerings across our seasonal categories. We are seeing an industry-wide shift from gas-powered to battery-powered mowers. Demand for cordless mowers have never been stronger and our lineup of battery-powered mowers, including RYOBI\u2019s 80-volt zero-turn riding mower, Milwaukee\u2019s new MAT and fuel walk mower, DEWALT\u2019s FlexVolt walk mower and Makita\u2019s LXT walk mower is unmatched. This lineup offers something for everyone, building on an ecosystem of innovative tools powered by the same battery platforms. In patio, we have continued to add optionality. And today, customers can create their perfect patio set to transform their outdoor living space through an enhanced online experience. And we expanded our assortment of grills. We are particularly excited about our new Traeger Timberline XL, which provides a larger cooking surface, easier maintenance and a side burner to enhance your cooking needs. Our new Nivo Nexgrill is the first propane-powered grill controlled via an app or your mobile device. The app displays timers, grill temperatures and internal food temperatures, providing a consistent cooking experience for hours. We are also excited about our Live Good program. Each year, our merchant provider customers with new and improved varieties to enhance the overall garden experience. We have expanded our disease and drought-resistant products offering superior performance. For example, beacon in patients are disease-resistant and our easy way petunias now require less sunlight and lasts up to 6 weeks longer. Adding these new hardier plants allows our customers to have a vibrant and healthier garden for longer. Our Live Good Cabo looks incredible. We are ready for spring from everything from shrubs to a variety of flower and edibles for every type of gardener. And with that, I turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone. In the first quarter, total sales were $38.9 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion or 3.8% from last year. During the first quarter, our total company comps were positive 2.2%, with positive comps of 12.9% in February, essentially flat in March and negative 2% in April. Comps in the U.S. were positive 1.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 12.5% in February, negative 0.3% in March and negative 2.9% in April. Recall that March reflects the anniversarying of stimulus and April was impacted by a delayed spring this year. Our results this quarter were once again driven by continued strength across the business. Spring temperatures broke late in all our geographies, but in particular impacted some of our northern regions. In local currency, both Mexico and Canada posted comps above the company average. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 33.8%, a decrease of approximately 20 basis points from last year, primarily driven by supply chain investments and pressure from lumber. We continue to successfully offset significant transportation and product cost pressures while maintaining our position as the customers\u2019 advocate for value. During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales remained essentially flat to last year at approximately 18.6%. We were pleased with our operating expense performance during the first quarter, which reflected planned increases in wage and planned rollout of investments designed to drive efficiency in our store environment. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 15.2% compared to 15.4% in the first quarter of 2021. Interest and other expense for the first quarter increased by $36 million to $369 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. Our effective tax rate was 23.9% in the first quarter of both fiscal 2022 and 2021. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $4.09, an increase of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Our total store count at the end of the quarter was 2,316 and selling square footage was 240 million square feet. Unfortunately, during the quarter, we lost a store in San Jose, California due to a fire. Thankfully, no one was injured and all of our associates have been reassigned to other nearby stores and the team has done a fantastic job continuing to serve our customers in the area. At the end of the quarter, inventories were $25.3 billion, up $6.1 billion compared to the first quarter of 2021 and inventory turns were 4.4x, down from 5.5x last year. This level of inventory reflects outsized demand for home improvement projects, actions taken to improve in-stocks and the impact of the delayed start to spring. While our in-stock position is not back to pre-pandemic levels, it is the healthiest it has been since the pandemic began. Turning to capital allocation, after investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As we have mentioned on previous calls, we plan to continue investing in our business with CapEx of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. We also plan to maintain flexibility to move faster or slower depending on the environment. During the first quarter, we invested approximately $700 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2 billion in dividends to our shareholders and we returned approximately $2.25 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.3%, up from 45.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Now I will comment on our updated guidance for fiscal 2022. As you heard from Ted, we are very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the first quarter, which surpassed our expectations. Today, we are raising guidance for 2022. We now expect sales growth and comp sales growth of approximately 3% for fiscal 2022. We expect comps to be stronger in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. We expect our fiscal 2022 operating margin to be approximately 15.4% for the year, and we expect mid single-digit percentage growth in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2021. While a number of uncertainties remain, we feel confident that we will be able to continue to manage through a dynamic environment while growing faster than our market and delivering exceptional shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Understanding that your overall results were very strong, are you seeing any signs that either inflationary pressure, rising interest rates or simply home improvement fatigue are starting to have a negative impact on the business? And does it give you pause that comp transactions were down high single digits in the quarter as maybe a leading indicator that the business could soften from here?\nTed Decker: Thanks, Michael. So a lot in that question. As we\u2019ve said, we had a great in comp-to-comp from last year. As you recall, Q1 last year was our highest first quarter sales and our highest comp at 31% in the very, very long time. So as we went into this year, we were understandably conservative as to how we thought Q1 would pan out. But in fact, we saw that the consumer is very engaged. The Pro is very strong, and we posted those results with very much delayed spring. In Q2, it\u2019s early, but we\u2019re off to a strong start. We also think that the fundamentals \u2013 I mean these are all very short-term in nature comments, but the fundamentals for home improvement remain incredibly supportive. So when you look at inflation and interest rates in any fatigue, if I take those in order, inflation is definitely higher than we thought. If you recall, last year, we thought we\u2019d have about 5% growth in ticket. We are seeing obviously much higher than that with 11% in ticket. A lot of that is inflation-driven. But our customers are resilient. We are not seeing the sensitivity to that level of inflation that we would have initially expected. On interest rates, and Richard can talk a little bit more about interest rates and housing, but we have not seen that impacting our business. And the nature of housing, again, Richard will cover in greater detail. And then the fatigue, we\u2019re not seeing at all. We\u2019d look at PCE and ships in PCE, and while we are seeing some shift to services in general, we\u2019re not seeing a big shift out of home improvement, and we\u2019re not seeing fatigue with our customers given repair/remodeler, intent and activity still tracking at the highest levels that we\u2019ve recorded. And then lastly, on transactions, we do always look for a balance of ticket and transactions, but again, with these inflation rates, it\u2019s a very unique year in inflation, and ticket is higher the norm for sure. But again, the consumer is hanging in there. And Richard, why don\u2019t you touch on the interest rates?\nRichard McPhail: Sure. So just first to start with who our customer is, you need to keep in mind our customers are homeowners. Virtually all sales to our Pro customers are on behalf of a homeowner, and over 90% of our DIY customers are homeowners as well. So let\u2019s talk about home improvement demand and what drives it. Over our history, we\u2019ve seen that home price appreciation is the primary driver of home improvement demand. When your home appreciates in value, you view it as a smart investment and you spend more on it. So let\u2019s look at what\u2019s happened at home prices. We\u2019ve seen appreciation of over 30% over the last 2 years. In fact, home equity values over the last 2 years have increased by 40% or over $7 billion just in the last 2 years. So the homeowner has never had a balance sheet that looks like this. They\u2019ve seen the price appreciation, and they have the means to spend. And in surveys, our customers tell us that their homes have never been more important, and their intent to do projects of all sizes has never been higher. And our Pros say the same thing about their backlogs. So let\u2019s talk about interest rates. I think it\u2019s important to remember that our addressable market is the 130 million housing units occupied in the U.S. plus probably, call it, 40 million to 50 million more in Canada and Mexico. Of those 130 million housing units, on any given year, only about 4% or 5% are sold. That means that over 95% of our customers are staying in place. They\u2019re not shopping for a mortgage. Nearly 40% of those homes are owned outright. Of those who have mortgages, about 93% of those mortgages are fixed rate. So when you think about our addressable market, the vast majority aren\u2019t really paying attention to mortgage rates. And what we\u2019ve \u2013 what\u2019s interesting about that is what we\u2019ve heard, when they do look at moving, they\u2019re actually more and more tempted to stay in their low fixed rate mortgage and remodel their home instead. So these low locked-in mortgages are probably a benefit to an improvement.\nMichael Lasser: That\u2019s all very helpful information. And in light of that, I hate to follow-up with such a negative question, but out of an abundance of conservatism, I\u2019ll ask that. Historically, Home Depot has talked about a 20 basis point margin change for every 1% increase or potentially decrease in its same-store sales. Recognizing that the environment hasn\u2019t necessarily been business as usual for quite some time, if we do want to take a conservative expectation on the overall macro, would it be reasonable to think that if comps were to decline 1% that, that would translate to a 20 basis point decline in operating margin or has the business just advanced so much over the last few years through the deployment of technology, a greater sophistication of supply chain and other factors that perhaps the deleverage wouldn\u2019t be as significant moving forward as it might have been in past?\nRichard McPhail: So Michael, first, we operate an activity-based model with respect to payroll, which is our largest operating cost. And so that naturally decreases as volume decreases. More importantly, we operate with a degree of financial flexibility in our P&L, and that financial flexibility allows us to manage as we think is appropriate in any given environment. So we have room to manage, and we\u2019re confident that we can take share in any environment and manage this P&L wisely per the environment. With respect to any old benchmarks we may have given, we\u2019re beyond that. We have financial flexibility in our model. And again, we would flex to sort of meet the circumstances we would see them.\nMichael Lasser: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much and good luck.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, everyone. My first question is if we could talk a little more detail around the intent and the backlog that was just mentioned. Curious if you\u2019re seeing demand come through because supply was constrained, there\u2019s some pent-up projects versus what the backlog or pipeline continues to build.\nRichard McPhail: Well, I think you can just start with some survey results. These are public and these are published by the National Association of Homebuilders. This is a survey that goes back to 2001. And the survey, if you bear with me, just sort of says, are conditions \u2013 are you optimistic or pessimistic, 50 being kind of the medium mark here. So for the 20 years up to 2020, that optimism index never got above a 58. Today, it stands at an 86. So that is the sentiment of the remodeler. With respect to backlog that is also surveyed, that number over the past 20 years never got above a 64. Today, it stands at an 84. Both of those sentiment numbers are all-time highs.\nSimeon Gutman: Fair enough. And maybe a follow-up. You mentioned home price appreciation being the most important lever. It looks like the home prices in Canada are starting to turn a bit, and the business seems to be holding up well. Can you talk about if that relationship holds or if the same dynamic, the macro conditions for the customer exists and that\u2019s why the business is sort of breaking away from that trend?\nTed Decker: Well, yes, our Canadian business. I\u2019m not as up to speed, Simeon, on the Canadian stats that Richard just went through for the U.S. But our Canadian business is in terrific shape. I mean, remember, they had much more significant lockdowns last year. Ontario, in particular, our stores were closed in the first quarter, and we had curbside pickup only. So the business is very, very strong. I don\u2019t have as much detail on the relationship with home prices.\nRichard McPhail: Well \u2013 but let\u2019s just sort of reflect on something. So last Q1, as a company, we reported a 31% comp. Canada was higher than that. So we had a tougher comp in Canada. And this quarter, our comp in Canada was higher than company average.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Two. One, simply, can you just quantify, if there\u2019s any way to quantify, the weather impact the late spring? How much of that hurt April? And what should we expect that to contribute into May? And then I\u2019ll have a follow-up question.\nTed Decker: So for the quarter, Michael, we think it was about 1%, the negative impact to comp sales in Q1.\nMichael Baker: And presumably, most of that occurs in April. Is that fair to say?\nTed Decker: Yes. Because February, it\u2019s not spring anywhere and it\u2019s our lowest-volume month. So yes, that\u2019s April-driven. As Richard said in his notes, March was more of a stimulus impact as well as a weaker spring in the south and then as you started to move toward northern markets, particularly cold weather in April and for the quarter, 1%.\nMichael Baker: Yes. We\u2019ve all felt that cold weather up here in the Northeast, although it\u2019s getting better now. I also wanted to follow-up on the home price appreciation question. We\u2019ve all looked at this for many years, and I think most people get that home price appreciation is that important. How concerned are you that higher interest rates eventually slow down existing home sales? And we\u2019ve seen that decline 3 or 4 months in a row, such that the record home price appreciation that we\u2019re seeing eventually has to slow down, particularly as the Fed keeps raising rates. And so how big of a concern is that as you think about the rest of the year?\nRichard McPhail: Well, I think we\u2019re in a unique position now in recent housing history where we have built a chronic shortage of housing units in the U.S. consistently and steadily for the last 10 years. Some economists assume that, that shortage is a little less than 2 million. You hear numbers as high as 4 million. If you take other estimates of what will likely be built, we\u2019re looking at at least 5 years, if not 7 or 8 years, before we could actually get back to a point of equilibrium. So we believe that supply and demand are going to be the main drivers of support for home price appreciation, and we know that, that chronic undersupply is going to be a condition for quite some time.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Yes, thanks. Appreciate you comment on that.\nRichard McPhail: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. So on the seasonality sort of lens as you think about the year, you mentioned shifting of the bathtub effect in the second quarter. It looks like the guide doesn\u2019t assume that this above-average seasonality that you saw in the first quarter despite a late spring holds. You\u2019re actually sort of degrading the seasonality going forward. So I guess my first \u2013 the two questions: are you expecting a full bathtub effect into the second quarter? And then why \u2013 is there any reason why you wouldn\u2019t think normal seasonality could hold through the back half?\nTed Decker: Good morning, Chris, yes, I would \u2013 we certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to degrade. I would say posting the results that we posted with a very cold and wet spring certainly exceeded our expectations. And as commented earlier, we haven\u2019t generally raised guidance after the spring because we say bathtub effect and too early into Q2 at the time of this call to make a determination. But the first quarter beat our expectation by such an extent, even with the poor weather, we felt necessary to raise to the 3% for the year. We haven\u2019t taken a specific of a view of Q2. I mean we know at least the 1% is going to flow into Q2. We generally get back all of our spring sales in Q2, even tracking back to the two or three worst early spring since I\u2019ve been at Home Depot. But it is still just so early, and our largest weeks are ahead of us. So we don\u2019t want to get too far over our skis, but we\u2019re certainly not anticipating the degradation of that normal bathtub effect.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then my follow-up question is a number of vendors have indicated more price increases are coming. Can you talk about how much of the ticket increase was inflation? How are you expecting inflation to play out over the year? Like we just sort of flatten out as we lap through more price as \u2013 over the next year? And do you expect units to turn positive as the year progresses? Thank you.\nTed Decker: Right. So I\u2019ll start and then Jeff will give a little bit more detail. Yes, as I mentioned earlier, inflation is higher than we had expected to the extent about 2x. The 11-odd percent ticket was the vast majority of that was inflation-driven. It is impacting transactions, but as we said, not to the extent that we would have thought. So that\u2019s all good. We have taken costs this year, and there is more on the table. Transportation, we\u2019ve just finished up our ocean contracts. That\u2019s a global contract cycle that goes into effect in May. So those are in place for the next 12 months. Those are certainly higher on a contract basis from 2021. So we think inflation doesn\u2019t go up necessarily from where we are but that it would hold steady at this, call it, double-digit, low 10%ish in our product categories through the balance of the year. In terms of the impact on transactions, we\u2019re going to have better transaction results in Q2 just given spring. When you think of the number of transactions in our garden business in the spring time, that\u2019s just a tremendous amount of transactions, and we feel very good that we\u2019ll get those in Q2. And then lumber was \u2013 it\u2019s been on a bit of a seesaw and was high on average to last year in Q1, and we saw that in negative transactions in lumber. But now we\u2019re down quite a bit, and we\u2019re down about 35% in lumber prices year-over-year. So we expect to pick up in Q2, in particular, in lumber activity. In terms of the balance of the year and how we think about managing through this, I\u2019ll let Jeff provide some more color.\nJeff Kinnaird: Yes. Thank you, Ted. Look, we are \u2013 to Ted\u2019s comments we are managing through an inflationary environment, about 2x what we expected in the first quarter. And we see some continuation of that. We are working with our supplier partners on managing through this inflationary environment. We\u2019ve had long-standing relationships with many of our suppliers, and it\u2019s a partnership to understand the ongoing complexities of the inflation we\u2019re seeing. What we are doing is we are still the customers\u2019 advocate for value in our business. And if you look at the value that we\u2019re offering across the spring categories, across the entire business, it is exceptional. If you look at the project business, we are pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in project-related demand, inclusive of some of the inflation that we have experienced across the organization. And again, as the customers advocate for value, we have the tools and the capabilities to manage our broader portfolio strategy and manage the inflationary environment. So, very pleased with the partnership across the business to manage this inflationary environment.\nChris Horvers: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning everyone. So, with the One Home Depot supply chain strategy, you guys are effectively moving into some new markets or certainly expanding your presence in certain verticals and expanding your TAM. Is there any way to potentially size the impact that some of these new markets are having on your results, be it \u2013 whether it\u2019s MRO, large Pros, etcetera, maybe places where you weren\u2019t as competitive just a couple of years ago?\nRichard McPhail: Generally speaking, we are excited about what we are building out in terms of capability and our ability to go after the repair and remodeler planned purchase occasions that we haven\u2019t necessarily been able to in the past. But when you start thinking about contribution to results, we are building an ecosystem here for the Pro. It\u2019s not just about fulfillment and delivery. It\u2019s about an online experience that we think is second to none that\u2019s seen incredible traction over the very short-term. We have a relationship with our Pros in the store that we think is second to none. And Hector, I will turn it to you for a second with some detail. But again, with respect to results, we are quite pleased that we grew by $40 billion over the last 2 years. We were really pleased that we were able to comp the comp and enter into a second quarter so far with two strong weeks. And I think over the coming years, you are going to see every element of our model add up to our ability to take market share in any environment. But Hector, maybe you will talk a little bit about the Pro.\nHector Padilla: Yes. Richard and Scot, we are building capabilities to attract more of the Pro planned purchase. Every one of those Pro planned purchase help us pull a lot of the other occasions out of our stores. So, when Richard talks about the ecosystem, it is about enabling capabilities across all channels to remove friction from the transactions and experiences from our Pros in every instance. We are super encouraged from the early signs that we are seeing on the commercialization of the supply chain investments that we are making. And the team is super encouraged and involved and engaged.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Thanks guys.\nTed Decker: And Scot, I would add on the MRO piece in the TAM, we couldn\u2019t be happier with the combination of our legacy Interline HD Pro business with Home Depot Supply. So, not only did we combine the number one and two players in that industry, but the Home Depot Supply had additional verticals that our business didn\u2019t participate in. So, we think the TAM in that MRO market essentially doubled to about $100 billion, and we still sit with less than 10% share. The capabilities that we are building, combining those two businesses, we are well on our way of combining sales forces, getting customers oriented to one legacy customer sales force or the other. We are beginning to integrate the supply chains. What we are able to do now in MRO for multifamily housing is incredibly robust. And then new verticals, hospitality in particular, as travel has come back. In the hospitality, occupancy rates are going up. That business is just booming. So, we love our position in MRO in the verticals we are in. And Shane O\u2019Kelly and his team are just doing a great job of that business.\nRichard McPhail: I think, just to the TAM point, we talk about the 130 million households in the U.S., about 30 million of those households actually occupy multifamily dwellings. And so that HD Supply acquisition opened up that TAM for us and is a unique attribute of The Home Depot.\nScot Ciccarelli: Excellent. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much. Wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on puts and takes for 2Q to 4Q with respect to gross margin and SG&A, I guess in the context of assuming inflation remains at the current level. And then also a bit more context on how you think traffic and ticket will shake out for the full year. And then I have one other question.\nRichard McPhail: Sure. So, for the year, we believe that gross margin, if you just sort of stay mix-neutral, gross margin will see slight pressure from the investments we are making in One Supply Chain. Those have been planned all year, and we have expected that for a while. With respect to operating expense leverage, as we have taken our sales guidance up, we have also raised our operating margin guidance. That reflects the operating expense leverage we expect to generate on those incremental sales. With respect to ticket and transaction, we assume that comps in the back half are positive. If inflation persists for the year, persist at current levels, we expect ticket could be in the range of 10% to 12% for the year, offset by transactions to net out to a three comp for the year.\nKaren Short: So, I guess the question on that, my follow-up would be, I mean investors are focused on your 2-year \u2013 1-year, 2-year, 3-year traffic trends. And I appreciate there is a labor efficiency component with negative traffic to some extent. But at what point does the traffic on a multiyear basis maybe start to concern you?\nTed Decker: Well, this is definitely a unique year for sure in our ticket and transaction dynamic. As I stated earlier, we do look for a balance between ticket and transaction. And we usually plan that growth will come from more or less an equal mix of ticket and transaction. With the two fundamental things going on, Karen, one we are \u2013 to your point on 2-year and 3-year stacks, we are comping off the $40 billion of sales growth that Richard commented on. And in Q1, at a 31% comp, the highest comp in the longest time at Home Depot. And to comp that, we didn\u2019t plan on, to comp that is a huge positive. Now, the balance isn\u2019t the norm for sure, again, a unique year with this level of inflation, 10%-odd. But the customer\u2019s engagement is much more resilient than we would have thought. That\u2019s why we hit \u2013 we knew the inflation going into the year, and we knew the potential impact to transactions. The level of activity in our space, and I have talked about the backlog and the intents, is really helping offset that in the consumers staying more engaged. Now as we lap through these extraordinary comps from the $40 billion of growth and certainly hopefully lap through the inflation, we would get back to the balance that we would certainly prefer.\nKaren Short: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZack Fadem: Hey good morning. Ted, following up on your comment that Q1 beat your expectations, could you talk about the extent that was Pro-driven versus DIY or other pockets of your business? And then as you think about the second half of this year, to what extent do you incorporate stable Pro trends? And could they offset a more variable DIY if the macro or inflationary environment softens from here?\nTed Decker: Sure. I would start by saying in even our Pro traffic is consumer-driven, right. I mean all projects fundamentally on the home \u2013 we certainly have trades in our business, buying product for servicing other spaces than the home, but the vast majority of our activity is supportive of the home. And whether it\u2019s a consumer buying themselves or a Pro, the Pro is buying ultimately for a consumer\u2019s home. So, with that being said, though, yes, Pro is stronger than we would have thought. I mean that\u2019s where the beat came from. Our Pro is incredibly strong. And we are so optimistic of, as Hector outlined, ecosystem we are building. We just continue to gain momentum with that Pro customer and certainly offset more of an as-expected consumer. When you think of spring as a consumer business in terms of garden, we don\u2019t have large penetrations in Pro in our garden business, so that is consumer-driven. And then the stimulus is really impacting the consumer. I mean we all have heard plenty of anecdotes about consumers getting their check last March truly going to buy a new power tool or a new lawnmower. So, that was what was unique about the consumer. In terms of the trend over time, not just the intent that Richard talked about in the ecosystem, that Hector talked about, but what we love with our Pro customer and the confidence we continue to build in what\u2019s happening is when we look at our comps with our Pro customers, we get a stronger progression of comps with the Pro from what we call an unplanned purchase in store, which is still a strong comp, but sequentially going up to higher and higher comps as we get to a planned delivered purchase. So, think of that Pro who is just coming to the store to do cash and carry and an unplanned purchase versus one who we know is staging out a project and getting that project delivered. The sequence of comps of that engagement gets higher and higher and higher with the highest being planned delivered. Also, when you think about the engagement with our loyalty models in our engagement with our sales forces, again, while still positive, our Pros who are not in our loyalty program, buying a cash-and-carry unplanned purchase while positive, that is the lowest comp going all the way through to a Pro who is in the loyalty program, who is purchasing with us on an interconnected basis and is managed by an outside sales contact, those, by far, have the highest comp within the Pro. So, we just love this ecosystem that we are building, the engagement that we are starting to see, the sequential strength of comps as these Pros get more engaged with us. And yes, we think those Pro trends are going to keep powering the business.\nZack Fadem: Thanks Ted. That\u2019s helpful. And then for Richard, with your inventory growth outpacing sales growth for the past four quarters by a pretty wide margin, how do you think about your position here in terms of having enough inventory or too much inventory? And with the slower start to spring that you called out, how should we think about the potential impact of higher promo on the gross margin line?\nRichard McPhail: So, first of all, we are \u2013 we took steps, as Ted had said earlier in the call, to invest in improving our in-stock position. And while we are not \u2013 we are quite where we were pre-pandemic, we are the healthiest we have been in the last few years. So, if you think about sort of that pull-forward of inventory, making sure that we landed inventory early because in this business, customer service starts with being in-stock. And you also consider the impact of a late spring. That really makes up about half of the increase in inventory, and the other half is simply the impact of inflation. So, as we think about this through the year, obviously, we are \u2013 as spring kicks in, we will see that inventory begin to reflect the seasonality. And we work hard. Our merchants and our supply chain team and our vendor partners work hard to make sure that we have an advantaged position.\nTed Decker: Yes. Just a comment on the promotional activity, we did shift an appliance event into May, driven by the Easter following mid-April. As I commented, thrilled with the performance of our appliance business as we finish the event in May. We \u2013 at this point, we don\u2019t focus on promotions at all. Our focus is providing everyday value for our customers. That has been multiple years of progression, and we are thrilled with the value we are providing every single day in terms of being priced right every day, driving great innovation and driving a great experience for our customers.\nZack Fadem: Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Zaccone: Great. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a follow-up about consumer spending towards the home since it\u2019s been discussed in detail here. Clearly, you are seeing strong demand from ongoing projects. I think investors are trying to grapple with the fact that home spending may slow at some point because of the macro, but the home also has increased importance post-pandemic. What\u2019s your take on that debate? Do you think that makes home improvement spending more recession-resistant than it\u2019s been in the past?\nRichard McPhail: Well, we really just have to look at the health of our customer today, which is strong. And we also have to listen to our customers, those same surveys where the Pro survey, there is also one with respect to consumer intent to do projects. Homeowner intent to do projects of small, medium and large sizes has never been higher than right now.\nSteven Zaccone: Got it. Very helpful. Then just shifting, could you talk about capital allocation priorities if the macro environment were to get a bit choppier? How do you balance capital investment, share buyback and the potential for M&A? And I guess specific to M&A, it\u2019s been 18 months since you did the HD Supply acquisition. Would you be open to additional M&A in the next few years to reach your higher TAM? How best to think about the criteria?\nRichard McPhail: Well, with respect to capital allocation, we generated strong free cash flow and so have returned significant capital to shareholders over the last decade-plus. With respect to CapEx and investment in the business, we take a long-term view. We are always going to invest ahead of the customer. We are always looking years ahead to make sure that we build the best customer experience in home improvement. And so that would likely be our stance. But we always have to take circumstances into consideration, and we do that in any event.\nTed Decker: And on M&A, we have always maintained an active strategic business development group, and they are always looking in the marketplace for companies really regardless of size, generally on the smaller size, that can add capabilities. So, you have heard us talk about some various data shops we have acquired. Certainly, the larger acquisition of supply helped us into a market space, and that is an ongoing review that we are active looking at capabilities and market spaces that an acquisition can help accelerate our development in that space.\nSteven Zaccone: Great. Thank you very much.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for letting me in and great results and congrats. On the inflation front, curious if you are seeing any unit demand destruction as you have been taking retails higher, or is there any signs of trade-down in the basket? Walmart called that out this morning, and I know your basket is obviously very different than theirs. Just wondering if you are seeing anything on that front?\nTed Decker: Chuck, good morning. We are seeing no trade-down in the environment, and we are thrilled with the innovation that we are offering to our customers. Ted commented \u2013 as I commented earlier, we are seeing trade-up for innovation. We are seeing a lot of activity around our consumers looking to improve their homes, to adopt new innovations. I talked about the electrified lawnmower business and the opportunity there. That\u2019s just one example of many examples of trade-up. And then on the project business, we are seeing great demand, as we commented earlier on the project business, both for the Pro and for the consumer.\nChuck Grom: Okay. That\u2019s great to hear. And then one for Richard, can you flesh out the expectation for comps in the front half to be better than the second half? If I look at your compares on a 3-year geo stack, they are pretty consistent. Just wondering if you are being conservative there or I guess the expectation for the trend to slow a little bit in the last six months of the year.\nRichard McPhail: It\u2019s early. What I would say is we do expect Q2 to be the highest-comp quarter of the year. And expect the first half to be higher than the second half, but we do expect positive comps through the year.\nChuck Grom: In the back half. Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in August.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci : Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nEdward Decker : Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. As you'll hear from the team shortly, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was largely in line with our expectations. For fiscal 2023, sales were $152.7 billion, down 3% from the prior year. Comp sales declined 3.2% versus last year, and our U.S. stores had negative comps of 3.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $15.11 compared to $16.69 in the prior year. After three years of exceptional growth for our business, 2023 was a year of moderation. It was also a year of opportunity. We focused on several operational improvements to strengthen the business, while also staying true to the growth opportunities detailed at our Investor Conference in June. As we reflect on 2023, we are better positioned in four key areas. We invested in our associates, the heartbeat of our company and the storage of customer service, effectively manage disinflation, while maintaining a strong value proposition for our customers, right sized our inventory position in increased in-stock and on-shelf availability levels, and we reduced fixed costs in the business that were introduced during the pandemic. As you know, at the beginning of 2023, we announced an approximately $1 billion investment in increased annualized compensation for our frontline hourly associates. This allowed us to improve customer service, position ourselves favorably in the market, attract and retain the most qualified talent, drive greater efficiency and productivity across the business, and improve safely broadly. We also navigated a unique disinflationary environment. We did this by leveraging our best-in-class cost finance team in merchants to effectively manage cost movements, while also being our customers advocate for value. And we believe prices have essentially settled in the marketplace. After several years of unprecedented sales growth, we entered 2023 with more inventory than we would've preferred. While the products we sell have low obsolescence, our teams work throughout the year to improve inventory productivity while delivering the highest in-stock and on-shelf availability rates since the pandemic. Today, we feel very good about our inventory position heading into 2024. Productivity and efficiency are hallmarks of the Home Depot, and as you heard at our Investor Conference in June, we announced our commitment to reduce fixed costs by approximately $500 million to be fully realized in 2024. We've now taken the necessary actions to achieve this cost benefit, which Richard will detail in a moment. As we look forward to 2024, we remain focused on our strategic opportunities of creating the best interconnected experience, growing our Pro wallet share through our unique ecosystem of capabilities and building new stores. In December 2023, we made a strategic acquisition of Construction Resources, a leading distributor of design-oriented surfaces, appliances, and architectural specialty products for Pro contractors focused on renovation, remodeling, and residential home building. This acquisition adds to our robust product offering of products and services. It allows our complex Pro\u2019s to easily shop across aesthetic product categories in a showroom setting, which is how they're accustomed to shopping for these types of goods. We are excited to welcome Construction Resources into the Home Depot family. In 2024, we will continue learning and building out new capabilities for the complex Pro. We are expanding our assortments, fulfillment options and our outside sales force and just recently began piloting trade credit options. In addition, we continue to work on new order management capabilities to better manage complex Pro orders. For the complex Pro opportunity, this means that by the end of 2024, we will have 17 of our top Pro markets equipped with new fulfillment options, localized product assortment and expanded sales force and enhanced digital capabilities with trade credit and order management in pilot for development. What I hope you take away today is how great we feel about our business and how well we are positioning the business for the future. We remain excited about the opportunity to grow our share of a fragmented $950 billion-plus market. Our associates and supplier partners have continually demonstrated agility and resilience, and I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ann.\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our operational excellence and the investments we continue to make in the business. As you heard from Ted, we remain focused on three main strategic opportunities of creating the best interconnected experience, growing our Pro wallet share through our unique ecosystem of capabilities and build in new stores. As we continue to create the best interconnected experience and remove friction from our customers shopping journey, one of our biggest areas of opportunity is within our post-sale experience. For the majority of our customers, this process has largely been unchanged for the last 44 years, and we have opportunities to improve this experience. In 2023, we made significant progress taking friction out of our online order management process. Today, we have enhanced our systems to better allow our customers to both modify orders and self-service online returns. In 2024, we will focus on building more robust capabilities to support an interconnected self-service returns process where customers will have the ability to start a return online and complete that return via mail or in-store. We have just begun all of this work in earnest and are very excited about the friction we will remove through this process while realizing significant productivity benefits over the long term. Through these enhancements and new capabilities in our returns process, we gain efficiencies by reducing transaction time and improving on-shelf availability, enabling better inventory management. We also improved customer service by allowing the customer to start and complete their return, however they want. As you've heard us say many times, we are focused on making our interconnected experience better and more convenient no matter how our customers choose to engage with us. As we mentioned at our Investor Conference in June, we plan to open approximately 80 new stores over the next five years. Our current network of over 2,300 stores throughout North America makes the Home Depot the most convenient physical destination for customers to shop for their home improvement products. We have a premier real estate footprint that provides convenience for the customer that we believe is nearly impossible to replicate. And we will continue to build out this footprint in a very strategic way by investing in new stores in areas that have experienced significant population growth or where it makes sense to relieve some pressure on existing high-volume stores. In fiscal 2023, we opened 13 new stores. Eight in the U.S. and five in Mexico. In the U.S., our eight new stores were roughly split between stores relieving pressure from higher volume existing stores and stores where we identified void in new high-growth areas. As an example, we are already seeing great results for many of these new stores and are particularly pleased with our Mapunapuna store in Honolulu, which allows us to better serve the Honolulu market. For fiscal 2024, we plan to open approximately 12 new stores. Beyond our focus on removing friction and growing to new stores, we have a lot of initiatives in 2024 geared at growing our share of wallet with the Pro. My new organization will be focused on better enabling alignment so we can more seamlessly deliver on our unique value proposition for all Pros. When we invest in new assets and capabilities to better serve the complex Pro, this also improves our Pro experience in our stores. For example, more job site delivery orders fulfilled from our distribution centers means less congestion in our stores and less time dedicated to picking, packing and staging orders for delivery. This gives our in-store Pro sales associates more time to dedicate to our Pros. Additionally, the ability to fulfill large orders through our distribution network also means that we have more product in stock and available for sale for all those Pros shopping in our stores. These improvements benefit our associates and all of our Pros. Our investments in these strategic initiatives as well as the investments in our associates has set us up for success. Recall that at the beginning of the year, we announced a significant investment of approximately $1 billion in increased annualized compensation for frontline hourly associates. As a result of this investment, we saw what we intended to see meaningful improvement in our attrition rates, particularly among our most tenured associates, which drove improved customer service, productivity and safety. I'm excited to see all of our initiatives gaining traction, and I want to thank our amazing associates for all that they do. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\nWilliam Bastek: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the fourth quarter, our sales were largely in line with our expectations. However, we did have some unfavorable impacts from weather in January and core commodity deflation. We saw a continuation of the trend that we've been observing throughout the year, with softness in certain big ticket discretionary type purchases. Our customers continue to take on smaller projects while still deferring larger projects. Turning to our department comp performance for the fourth quarter, our building materials and outdoor garden departments posted positive comps and 6 of our remaining 12 merchandising departments posted comps above the company average, including appliances, plumbing, tools, paint, indoor garden, and hardware. During the fourth quarter, our comp transactions decreased 2.1% and comp average ticket decreased 1.3%. However, we continue to see our customers trading up for new and innovative products. Deflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket by 35 basis points during the fourth quarter, driven by deflation in lumber and copper wire. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see, on average, a decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago. However, framing and panel lumber pricing experienced the most stable pricing levels during the quarter in some time. As an example, framing lumber started the quarter at approximately $370 per 1,000 board feet compared to ending the quarter at approximately $395, representing a change of less than 7%. The big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000, were down 6.9% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We continued to see softer engagement in big-ticket discretionary categories like flooring, countertops and cabinets. During the fourth quarter, our Pro and DIY customers performance was relatively in line with one another. While internal and external surveys suggest that Pro backlogs are lower than they were a year ago, they have remained stable and elevated relative to historical norms. Turning to total company online sales. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to enhance our digital customer experience with a number of new capabilities, including an enhanced browsing experience featuring the best sellers in a local market and new product discovery zones, which highlights what's trending based on new and highly rated products. For those customers that transacted with us online during the fourth quarter, nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores. During the fourth quarter, we hosted our annual decorative holiday, Gift Center and Black Friday events. We saw strong engagement across all these events with our decorative holiday event posting a record sales year. As Ted mentioned, 2023 marked the year of significant progress for our inventory management and on-shelf availability while effectively navigating a disinflationary pricing environment and maintaining our position as the customer's advocate for value. Today, we are in a great position regarding our inventory levels. Our in-stocks are the best they've been in a number of years, and we are delivering a compelling assortment for our customers' home improvement needs. We are looking forward to the year ahead, particularly with the spring selling season right around the corner, and we have a great lineup of new and innovative products in live goods to outdoor power equipment. We're excited to expand our offering of Pro outdoor tools with the launch of our new cordless battery powered, Milwaukee, M18, backpack blower and straight shaft trimmer, broadening our assortment for the Pro landscaper. And our Spring Gift Center event continues to lean into cordless technology with a wide variety of products from RYOBI, Milwaukee, Makita and DEWALT, many of which are exclusive to the Home Depot and the big box retail channel. We're also excited about our live goods program. Each year, our merchants partner with our national and regional growers to provide our customers with new and improved varieties to enhance the overall garden experience. We've made significant investments in partnership with our growers to bring new varieties to our customers that are more disease resistant, tolerant to different climates and require less watering. Investing in our relationships with our growers will allow us to continue to drive innovation to meet our customers' needs and improve their shopping experience while building loyalty to the Home Depot. As we look forward to spring, we're excited about continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in stock and available for our customers when and how they need it. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, total sales were $34.8 billion, a decrease of 2.9% from last year. During the fourth quarter, our total company comps were negative 3.5% with comps of negative 2.5% in November, positive 1.1% in December and negative 8.5% in January. Comps in the U.S. were negative 4% for the quarter with comps of negative 2.7% in November, positive 0.6% in December and negative 9.1% in January. In local currency, Mexico and Canada posted comps above the company average with Mexico posting positive comps. It is important to note that adjusting for holiday shifts and weather-related impacts in January, monthly comps relatively consistent across the quarter. For the year, our sales totaled $152.7 billion, a decrease of 3% versus fiscal 2022. For the year, total company comp sales decreased 3.2% and U.S. comp sales decreased 3.5%. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was approximately 33.1%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. For the year, our gross margin was approximately 33.4%, a decrease of 15 basis points from last year, which was in line with our expectations. During the fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased approximately 115 basis points to 21.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Our operating expense performance during the fourth quarter reflects our previously executed compensation increases for hourly associates as well as deleverage from our top line results. For the year, operating expenses were approximately 19.2% of sales, representing an increase of approximately 90 basis points from fiscal 2022. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 11.9% and for the year was approximately 14.2%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter increased by $50 million to $458 million. In the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2023, our effective tax rate was 24%. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.82, a decrease of 14.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2023 were $15.11, a decrease of 9.5% compared to fiscal 2022. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $21 billion, down $3.9 billion or approximately 16% versus last year, and inventory turns were 4.3x, up from 4.2x from the second period last year. Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we invested approximately $860 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. This brings total capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 to approximately $3.2 billion. During the year, we opened 13 new stores, bringing our store count to 2,335 at the end of fiscal 2023. Retail selling square footage was approximately 242 million square feet and total sales per retail square foot were approximately $605 in fiscal 2023. Additionally, we invested approximately $1.5 billion on three acquisitions during fiscal 2023, accelerating our strategic initiatives and providing us with better capabilities to serve our customers. During the year, we paid approximately $8.4 billion of dividends to our shareholders. Today, we announced our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 7.7% to $2.25 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $9 per share. And finally, during fiscal 2023, we returned approximately $8 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases, including $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 36.7% compared to 44.6% at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Now I'll comment on our outlook for 2024. First, let me point out that fiscal 2024 will include a 53rd week, so the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 will consist of 14 weeks. We will continue to report comps on a 52-week basis, but we will base our overall guidance on 53 weeks. As you heard from Ted, we feel great about the actions we took in 2023 to position us well heading into 2024. And while there are signs that the economy is on the way towards normalization, the home improvement market still faces headwinds as we look ahead to fiscal 2024. We considered several factors that informed our outlook for fiscal 2024. On the positive side, we faced a number of pressures in fiscal 2023 that are unlikely to repeat in fiscal 2024. In 2023, we saw four increases in the Fed funds rate, a sharp decline in existing home sales and approximately 110 basis points of comp pressure from lumber deflation. However, we still expect pressures to our business in fiscal 2024. Personal consumption growth as measured by PCE is expected to decelerate compared to 2023. Our share of PCE also remains slightly elevated relative to 2019 and has been on a glide path towards 2019 levels. Higher interest rates at the beginning of 2024 relative to last year will likely continue to pressure demand for larger projects. And the effects from pull forward of demand during the pandemic as well as some project deferral could impact demand into 2024. As we consider these influences on home improvement demand, we are planning for a year of continued moderation but with slightly less pressure to comp sales than what we faced in fiscal 2023. Our fiscal 2024 outlook is for total sales growth to outpace sales comp with sales growth of approximately positive 1% and comp sales of approximately negative 1% compared to fiscal 2023. Total sales growth will benefit from a 53rd week as well as from the acquisitions we made and the new stores we opened in fiscal 2023 and the stores we plan to open in fiscal 2024. We expect the 53rd week will contribute approximately $2.3 billion in sales. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.9%, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2023. This primarily reflects a lower product and transportation cost environment relative to fiscal 2023 as well as benefits from a portion of the approximately $500 million in reduced fixed costs that we will realize in fiscal 2024. Further, we expect operating margin of approximately 14.1%. This reflects deleverage from sales and pressure from targeted incentive compensation as we are overlapping lower incentive compensation paid than planned in 2023. This will be partially offset by the benefits from the approximately $500 million in fixed costs that we will realize in fiscal 2024 in both cost of goods sold and operating expenses. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion. Our diluted earnings per share percent growth is targeted to be approximately 1% compared to fiscal 2023, with the extra week contributing approximately $0.30. We plan to continue investing in our business with capital expenditures of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. We believe we have positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment. The investments we've made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model. As we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen our position with our customers, leverage our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: My first question is how much of this minus 1 comp view is an industry view plus or minus share gain, I'm assuming plus versus if you look at current purchasing trends and Richard, you noted some of the, let's say, some of the less headwinds that you noted that you expect to face in 2023.\nRichard McPhail: Sure. Yes, Simeon, in short, we expect that the macro pressures we called out to point towards low single-digit negative growth from improvement demand and then for us to outperform the market. And that's how we got to the negative 1% comp guide. And your second part of your question, Simeon?\nSimeon Gutman: I guess, that was the whole part of it. It was how much of it is a macro view versus like a forecast for housing plus market share versus you have less headwinds that you noted in the current year, plus you're combining that with how the consumer is behaving.\nRichard McPhail: Well, it's all taken as a whole, there are several cross currents here. Again, we face macro headwinds, albeit at a lesser degree than we faced in 2023. And so again, just to quickly tick through them, PCE is expected to decelerate. We still have a slightly -- as a market, we have a slightly elevated share of PCE versus 2019, we know that, that has gradually receded since 2021. The interest rate environment is still one where while we see our customers have the means to spend, they are taking more of a deferral stance with respect to large project demand. And we believe there was some pull forward certain spend during the period of 2020 to 2022 that we're working out. Housing, it's a little hard to tease out. Obviously, home values have held in there. We now see home prices having appreciated by over 46% since 2019. Turnover has dropped sharply over the last two years, and that's a headwind possibly offset by some level of improvement in place. So we're essentially neutral on housing short term. And so that's -- all of those have an impact on our market. And then as you said, we expect to gained share in any macro environment through our growth initiatives of Pro, the interconnected experience and new stores, and that takes us to our negative 1% comp outlook.\nSimeon Gutman: Fair enough. And then a follow-up, can we ask about the shape of the year? You lapped lumber deflation in the first part of the year, maybe some weather. So that should be better, but the second half is in theory post interest rate cuts, maybe durables get a little bit better. So how should we think about it?\nRichard McPhail: Yes. So Simeon, lumber was actually a function more of a comparison to 2022 and 2023. If you compare the lumber charts, just I'd encourage you to pull it up, lumber prices were relatively steady across 2023. So we don't really see a material impact to 2024. With respect to '24, first, we expect a normal seasonal curve for our business. So there's really no seasonal shift in how we think about the halves. We anticipate the second half coming in slightly better than the first half, with both being negative, at least as implied in our guidance. It might help to recall the halves for 2023, were relatively in line with one another. .\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zachary Fadem with Wells Fargo.\nZachary Fadem: So starting with the underlying comp commentary. Curious if you could share some thoughts on Pro versus DIY trends, both for the industry as well as your share gain potential? And then any early thoughts on traffic versus ticket?\nEdward Decker: If you look at Pro versus consumer, Zach. I mean, for us, they were -- they were effectively the same in Q4. Overall, industry don't see that being too terribly much different. I can say within our Pro in any customer segment that we have, the managed account customer who is engaging in the ecosystem that we're building was the highest performing customer segment in Q4 and throughout 2023, and we would expect that to continue into 2024 as well as we continue to build out the capabilities.\nZachary Fadem: And then you called out the disinflationary price environment. I'm curious if you could parse that out between commodity deflation and promotional activity. And then as you look at '24, could you walk through the signs that you're seeing to suggest that we have turned the corner on the disinflation?\nWilliam Bastek: Yes. This is Billy. Thanks for the question. On the commodity piece, that is embedded in our forward-looking guidance that Rich had articulated during his prepared remarks. So -- and as it relates to the promotional cadence, we haven't seen any difference if you go back pre-pandemic to the promotional activity. We are in a very normalized environment. We do feel that pricing has kind of settled as we mentioned earlier. And so from a promotional standpoint, cadence, we don't see any differentiation then like I said, what we lived through prior to the pandemic. So very consistent. We really are in a solid marketplace as it relates to that and look forward to 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers: So I was curious, as you think about the share of wallet, what did you learn over the holiday season? Are there any signs of life that you're seeing? You mentioned outdoor garden, I'm assuming maybe that's Christmas trees and Christmas decor. Is there any signs of life that maybe the smaller ticket softline stuff is starting to show where more decor items starting to show some signs of life. Did you see anything in appliances or on the bigger ticket side?\nEdward Decker: No. Chris, it's Ted. We saw great signs of life. There's loads of life in the sector. I mean we're working through some macro factors, as Richard articulated, but the consumer is healthy and the consumer is engaged. They're just engaged at this point in smaller projects. And you called out a number of categories that we had terrific engagement in Q4. Our Deco holiday program was just an exceptional performer, the merchants there, just keep taking that to the next level. We know we took a tremendous amount of share in Deco holiday as the customer responds to our offering. Our gift center line up with the brands we have and the values that Billy and team put in the marketplace had a tremendous response. As you said, Deco Holiday in live goods did extremely well. Things like totes, I mean we saw sold record units of totes in Q4 as people responded to our storage event. So we still have tremendous traffic, just pure volume of traffic and engagement. Again, it's just that bigger ticket. Although as an aside on bigger ticket, appliances was one of our better relative performers. And I think a lot of that has to do with our service levels as we're integrating the TEMCO acquisition in the percentage of our deliveries that they're now handling in the service level scores and on time and complete that they're providing our customers. We think that's a big piece of the momentum behind our appliance business as well as the strength of our online shopping experience for major appliances.\nChristopher Horvers: And then as a follow-up, can you talk about what drove the gross margin decline here in the fourth quarter? You mentioned the expansion here coming in 2024. And then separately, just on the SG&A side, you did have a, I think, sizable legal gain in the first quarter of last year. Is that something that will have an effect on 2024 overall?\nRichard McPhail: Sure. Chris, it's Richard. So first on fourth quarter gross margin, I'd say, our gross margin, first of all, is in line with our expectations for the year. For the full year and in the quarter, we saw some pull forward of pressure from pricing actions ahead of cost decreases. The good news is you now see those at current levels, and Billy mentioned, we're really at kind of a settled point right now in retail and in cost. As we begin to work through inventory layers, you now see the impact of those cost decreases that we took earlier in the year coming through in 2024, and that's the major driver behind the gross margin expansion that we've guided to. On the settlement that you called out, I appreciate the question. It's important to note that there is some geography noise in year-over-year comparisons driven by that settlement. So just for everyone's recollection, we had a significant settlement in Q1 of 2023. That was a benefit to operating expense. Now as we said we would do, we fully offset that benefit with short-term costs in 2023 that set us up to lower our cost base going forward. Those short-term costs were mostly incurred in cost of goods sold, including some actions taken to optimize inventory levels. So that settlement geography and the cost that offset it create a more favorable comparison in cost of goods sold and a less favorable comparison in OpEx on a year-over-year basis, but obviously, the two offset each other, and it\u2019s a geography shift.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist.\nScott Ciccarelli: Within your comp guide, can you help us understand how you guys are modeling any benefit or accretion from your complex Pro build-out just so we can better understand the thought process around it. And just as a side bar, can you also tell us how big of a margin drag you expect the incentive comp swing to be in '24?\nEdward Decker: On the complex Pro, I mean, clearly, the improvements there and the expectation that the managed account engaging in those capabilities will be the strongest performing customer segment. That's embedded in the guidance of comp sales in overall sales.\nRichard McPhail: And on the drag from lower incentive bonus in 2023, really the largest and most meaningful driver of deleverage, as you know, our OpEx leverage or deleverage as a function of sales growth. So the largest driver of that is simply sales deleverage as operating cost inflation remains higher than sales growth. To a lesser extent, we see deleverage from the the incentive compensation year-over-year.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Can I ask a follow-up on that? So just so I can understand that -- yes, I understand the managed accounts are kind of the fastest growing. But -- like are you guys able to kind of disaggregate, let's call it, the typical engagement you would have with those accounts. versus the expanding capabilities you're providing in certain markets? Or is it just too difficult to kind of separate those?\nEdward Decker: No, we cannot absolutely. And we disaggregate at every level you can imagine. We're just not going to share all that detail as you can imagine.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nCharles Grom: Just bigger picture. Curious what you guys are monitoring across regions or product categories to suggest that demand for the home improvement category from a unit volume perspective is starting to bottom here as we look out over the next couple of years?\nRichard McPhail: Well, just to hit it on the most fine point here, really the last three quarters, we've seen kind of the most stability and the -- I'd say, three quarters ago, we saw a marked recovery in transactions and think about that as a proxy for units, but units followed similarly. Over the last three quarters, we've seen nice stability. And as we've said before, we define a healthy home improvement market is one where ticket and transaction are both positive. What we have seen on the good side here is that ticket and transaction have begun to converge and in fact, have sort of really much more tightly converged over the last three quarters. . They were still both negative for the quarter, but that's really just reflective of the macro pressure that continues. From a geographic perspective, we aren't really necessarily able to tease out differences in recovery and transactions or units more of a national dynamic.\nCharles Grom : Okay. Great. And then one for you, Richard. Just how should we think about the every point of comp? Hypothetically, you guys are being a little bit conservative here on the down 1. Just trying to think about how the model could respond.\nRichard McPhail: Sure. I mean the basics are you can imagine with no management intervention, the natural rule of leverage or deleverage is about 10 basis points per point of comp up or down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: As we look back to the last couple of downturns in home improvement, there was a pretty robust recovery in the subsequent years after a few periods of negative comps. Are you seeing any evidence or signs that this recovery whenever it happens, would be different?\nEdward Decker: We don't see why it would be different. I mean, if anything, the underpinning of this market segment remains incredibly strong. When I step back, and look at the macro, when you look at the influences that we watch most closely, home price appreciation, up 45-odd percent, home equity is up closer to 70%. That equity level, which is $10 trillion, $12 trillion increase since the pandemic has not been tapped. And in fact, HELOCs and cash out refis are at multiple years low right now as interest rates went up over the last two years. So you have tremendous potential in an untapped balance sheet and equity position in homes. We talk about the age of homes now well over 50% or over 40 years old. People are still working from home, more than they were certainly pre-pandemic. So usage in homes, the fundamental shortage of homes were I've seen anywhere between 2 million and 6 million units short. And on a near term, even forecast for 2024, we'll build 2000-odd units less than demand. So you're not even beginning to make up for that shortage in the near term. So you look at all those factors, millennials becoming a year or so way of becoming the single biggest source of customer segment spend in our space. They're a prime household formation in homeownership ages. So I look at all those and say, huge opportunity. And we've mentioned this before, but the pandemic in a sense is a bit like a giant hurricane, right? I mean, we had tremendous demand in growth in the segment, followed by a couple periods of moderation following that buildup. But as we watch every hurricane market, after you go through that cycle, it's as strong as ever. So with that backdrop of fundamental macros in the overall pandemic playing out over a five-year period like a giant national storm, we have every reason to be extremely optimistic about the future. And that's why we've made the comments today about how happy we are of what we accomplished, the management team here in the store associates and store leadership and supply chain just did such a great job level setting this business following that sort of pandemic storm and we couldn't feel better about how we're positioned from an operational point of view. And then we're sticking with all the strategic investments, our eyes are still on the prize of the best interconnected shopping experience, building out the Pro ecosystem for complex Pros and then having such confidence in our model to start a reasonably meaningful store build program. So we feel really, really good, Michael. Thanks for the question.\nMichael Lasser: That's very helpful, Ted. If I could just add one more question. It's on Richard's comment about the rule of thumb of 10 basis points of margin expansion for every 1 point of comp. And understanding that this is theoretical, does that move in a linear fashion, meaning if you get back to the trajectory of mid-single-digit comp eventually that you would see a better than trend rate of margin expansion at the higher the growth rate. And there was also a comment that rule of thumb would be outside of actions that would be taken. So can you discuss what actions might be taken to bend that curve on the upside over time?\nRichard McPhail: Thanks, Michael. Well, first, I certainly want to center you back to the comments we made at the Investor Conference in June where we call out a base case once we return to market normalization, a base case of 3% to 4% sales growth, flat gross margin, an assumption of operating expense and operating margin leverage and growth and EPS growth of mid- to high single-digit percentages. Within that, obviously, is sort of an implied leverage per comp point on our OpEx. I'm giving you a, what I would call, loose rule of thumb. It would apply for the most part to our sort of business model today, it certainly applies in the past and I would expect it to apply it loosely in the future. Embedded in that is a normal rate of productivity and efficiency that our teams delivered every single year. I mean underneath all this guidance and our results for 2023, which we were so pleased with, is an enormous amount of work on behalf of our team, think about the efficiency in our supply chain, you think about the efficiencies that our merchants bring every year in product cost. Of particular note, the productivity in our stores with some of the tools that are unleashing the power of AI and putting that in the hands of our associates, those are standard fair for us. They feed into what I would call normal operating leverage for the Home Depot, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve come to expect of ourselves. So that\u2019s a long way of saying, we always intend to lever OpEx at a certain point of sales growth. And I would stick with the basic rule of thumb, maybe higher, maybe slightly lower in some periods from time to time. On the question about what actions there may be, but we always operate with a degree of financial flexibility in the P&L. Although, I would tell you that we did our very best, and I think we accomplished our objective of reducing fixed costs towards the end of \u201823 that had built up during the pandemic, hence the $500 million in cost savings implied in our guide. There are always levers. We have to determine what environment we are operating in before we decide what levers to pull. And so for now, we\u2019ve provided what we would call our central case for 2024, but we\u2019re going to manage the business with the best interest of our long-term shareholders in mind.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays.\nSeth Sigman: I wanted to follow up on macro and the margins. Just on the macro side, you gave us a number of the factors that have built in here. I guess the real question is, what are the conditions needed for comps to actually get back to positive? Is it as simple as fully digesting the two years of lower housing turnover and that will happen at some point through this year? I guess, ultimately, can you return to growth without existing home sales improving?\nEdward Decker: Absolutely. I mean as we've said for the longest time, home turnover is a base of home improvement demand, but it's been pretty steady. If you look at 4.5-odd percent of housing stock is a multiyear percentage of turnover, and that equates to 5-ish million units. The reason we're calling out that is a factor in these last two years is the dramatic decrease. And there's definitely an understanding that there's an improvement in place cycle if you don't move and you stay in your house, but there's a lag effect. And arguably, that lag effect is a bit longer this time because of the interest rate environment and people are just being conservative of when they kick off a larger home improvement project in a home that they're going to ultimately stay in for a longer period of time. So that's the dynamic of housing turnover. We think that plays out. We're literally at a 40-year low in turnover, don't see that going lower. So you're going to cycle through that kind of a two-year pressure. And then do we get back to growth? Absolutely. I'd say, we have a neutral look on housing for 2024. We don't think there's incremental pressure nor do we think that we're quite ready for a hockey stick recovery. Richard has been talking for some time, and the Fed's stance of hire for longer. I think we now we have an appreciation that longer is going to go through the first half of this year. So even a lowering cycle in the back half, there's some timing effect to get mortgages, move homes, take a HELOC loan out, et cetera, to get a bigger project going. So that's why we're kind of calling for a slighter moderation to continue into '24. But as we said, the back half is marginally stronger. And we think all the macros line up for return to normalcy following that and with the capabilities that we're building, and we're taking share today with x percent of these capabilities complete. Super optimistic about how we're hitting the ground running as we continue to build going into a stronger market and the share gain opportunity.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Just one follow-up. Richard, you gave us a bunch of sensitivity numbers around the EBIT margins. I guess, more specifically on SG&A for this year. I realize there's a number of moving pieces that come back. But can you give us a feel for what base underlying SG&A growth should look like this year? I think the headline guidance is around 4% growth. But maybe what is it excluding incentive comp and some of the costs that you're lapping with the benefits that you're lapping, just so we could think about that?\nRichard McPhail : Yes, I'd tell you, the best way to look at this is that we are now - our P&L provides you with an appropriate jumping off point for your models, there's a lot of noise in operating expense. If you think about the geography of the settlement in Q1, you think about the geography of costs that we incurred, then you think about the geography of the $500 million in cost out, two-thirds of which will be realized in OpEx, one-third of which will be realized in cost of goods sold, and you just have a lot of noise. Again, the main driver of operating expense growth is going to be just at inflation on our base of operating expenses. And we think that if you look at our gross margin and our operating margin guide, these offer you the appropriate jumping off points for your modeling.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim.\nSteven Forbes: I'll keep it to one, just to end the call here. I wanted to follow-up on the complex Pro, Ted. I appreciate the comments in your prepared remarks around trade credit being piloted. I'm curious if you can maybe expand on some early learnings around those newer features being launched as we think through what the sort of managed account customer can contribute to growth over the coming years here?\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Yes, I'll kick that off. Thanks, Ed. First of all, we're in our early stages. And just as a reminder as well, HD Supply does trade credit today. So we're -- as we architect our program, there's a lot of learnings there. But what -- to me, typically in the room and Chip, you have a lot of it here with trade credit and his experience is helping us also form some of the intricacies of how we think about it. So I'll turn it over to Chip.\nChip Devine: Yes. Thanks, Steven. Trade credit is definitely a necessary capability that we\u2019re building really focused on that complex project. So as we invest in our pros and our capabilities to be able to service their larger jobs, trade credit is definitely necessary. So we\u2019re in early days, as Anne mentioned, piloting a number of different customers, but plan to grow and expand that through the next couple of quarters as we automate that into our selling system as well. .\nOperator: Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. .\nIsabel Janci: Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter call in May.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-11-14 13:25:32", "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to The Home Depot Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. [Operator Instructions]. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Ted.\nEdward Decker: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $37.7 billion, down 3% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 3.1% from the same period last year and our U.S. stores had negative comps of 3.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.81 in the third quarter compared to $4.24 in the third quarter last year.  The third quarter was in line with our expectations. Similar to the second quarter, we saw continued customer engagement with smaller projects and experienced pressure in certain big-ticket discretionary categories. In addition, lumber and copper and wire deflation and storm-related overlaps negatively impacted results in the quarter. Billy will discuss these and other business trends shortly.  During the third quarter, our Pro customer outperformed our DIY customer. While internal and external surveys suggest that Pro backlogs are lower than they were a year ago, they are still healthy and elevated relative to historical norms. There is only 1 quarter left in the year, we believe the endpoints for our previous guidance range are no longer likely outcomes.  As a result, and as we announced in this morning's press release, we narrowed our guidance range for fiscal 2023. Richard will take you through the details in a moment.  As we've discussed, this year reflects a period of moderation. However, we are confident in our ability to navigate through this unique environment. We remain very excited about our strategic initiatives and are committed to investing in the business to deliver the best interconnected shopping experience, capture wallet share with the Pro and grow our store footprint.  As we discussed at the investor conference in June, we continue to invest and focus on creating a frictionless interconnected shopping experience for our customers. We are pleased with the progress we are making. homedepot.com is one of the largest retail websites in the United States, and our digital app is one of the most highly rated in all of retail.  And yet, we believe there is still opportunity to reduce pain points across the shopping journey. Our teams are identifying areas of improvement like better communication throughout the shopping journey and an easier returns process and the ability to seamlessly and intuitively make changes to an order once placed.  For our Pros, we're investing in a multitude of initiatives. We remain focused on building out our unique ecosystem of products and services. As a result, we are evolving our organizational structure and recently elevated Ann-Marie Campbell to Senior Executive Vice President, better aligning our outside sales and service business in the global stores organization.  Pro is one of our biggest growth opportunities, and this organizational change will allow us to better serve them by leveraging our full ecosystem of expertise, product assortment, fulfillment and operations. Our merchants, store MET teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter, and I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work.  In addition, the Home Depot is proud to have tens of thousands of veterans, service members and military spouses and orange aprons. Last week, we announced The Home Depot Foundation surpassed the goal of $500 million invested in veterans causes and also increased the total commitment to $750 million by 2030.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Anne.\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that I'm very excited about my new role and the alignment this will create between the outside sales and services business and the global store organization.  As you heard at our investor conference in June, capturing a greater share of the Pro's wallet is one of our largest growth opportunities. It represents roughly $475 billion in addressable market, and today, we have relatively little share.  The beauty of The Home Depot is that we have unique competitive advantages. Our convenience stores, our leading brands, our engaged associates, our expansive fulfillment options that are unmatched and that can be leveraged for the benefit of our customers. And that's exactly what we aim to do.  To do that, our new organizational structure will create stronger momentum with our teams to drive success with the Pro.  Hector Padilla will focus on improving the experience for Pro's shopping in our stores. His 29-year tenure and knowledge of our store operations and new Pro capabilities will be instrumental in achieving our goals.  And Chip Devine, our Head of Outside Sales, brings nearly 30 years of distribution experience. He will work on building out capabilities to better serve more complex private needs.  Ultimately, we must focus on removing friction within our operations, so our customers have a great experience every single time no matter how they choose to shop with us, whether in the aisles of our stores, picking a product at the store, receiving product at their job site with a sales associate or digitally. We know that most of our Pros use many of these capabilities across our ecosystem when shopping with us. For us, we are building trust and a partnership that lasts for decades and across generations.  This means we have to work hard to deliver a great experience regardless of their point of interaction.  As you know, we have identified additional growth opportunities with the Pro, which requires us to invest in new capabilities and functionalities across the business. Think about the initiative we are undertaking with the complex Pro. This customer interacts differently. They are accustomed to interacting with their suppliers in a different way than our traditional business model. Pros working on complex projects want to reserve product, use trade credit and have products delivered to their job site in a staged manner.  While these capabilities exist in the market today, we are incorporating them in our full ecosystem to serve Pro customers in a way no one else can. I could not be more excited about the opportunity that lies ahead.  And for the in-store experience, over the last several years, we have talked about the importance of in-stock, and ultimately, on-shelf availability or OSA. Having the right products in stock in the right quantity and on the shelf available for purchase is critical, and we've implemented several initiatives to help us do this more effectively and efficiently. In the past, we've talked about GSR or get stores right. GSR drives productivity by using our proprietary space allocation model coupled with our tenured field merchandising teams to determine which categories to invest in on a store-by-store basis.  More recently, we have talked to you about our rollout of Sidekick and computer vision. Using machine learning technology, computer vision helps our associates quickly find de-palletized product in the overhead and Sidekick helps direct associates to key bays where OSA is low or outs exist.  Today, these tools have been deployed across all U.S. stores. And while early days, they have driven meaningful improvement in our on-shelf availability.  The beauty of these initiatives is that they also drive productivity. They make it easier for associates to restock product, have a greater depth of high-velocity product and ensure we remain in stock with more products on the shelf and available for sale.  As a result, we enable our associates to focus on the most important tasks and allocate more time to deliver a better shopping experience.  These are just a few examples of the many different types of initiatives that can drive significant value for our customers, our associates and our shareholders.  Despite a challenging year, our amazing associates have remained engaged and ready to serve our customers, and I want to thank them for all they do.  With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\nWilliam Bastek: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities.  As you heard from Ted, during the third quarter, our sales were in line with our expectations. However, we did have some unfavorable impacts from core commodity deflation and storm-related overlaps. We saw the continuation of the trend that we have been observing throughout the year with softness in certain big-ticket, discretionary-type purchases. Instead of engaging in larger projects, customers continued to take on smaller projects.  Turning to our department comp performance for the third quarter. Our Building Materials department posted a positive comp and 7 of our remaining 13 merchandising departments posted comps above the company average, including plumbing, appliances, hardware, outdoor garden, millwork, tools and paint.  During the third quarter, our comp transactions decreased 2.7% and comp average ticket decreased 0.3%. Excluding deflation from core commodities, we experienced comp average ticket growth, primarily driven by demand for new and innovative products.  Deflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 60 basis points during the third quarter, driven by deflation in lumber and copper.  During the third quarter, we continued to see a decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago. As an example, on average, framing lumber was approximately $420 per thousand board feet compared to approximately $545 in the third quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of over 20%.  Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were down 5.2% compared to the third quarter of last year. We continue to see softer engagement in big-ticket discretionary categories like flooring, countertops and cabinets.  However, we saw big ticket strength in Pro-heavy categories like roofing, insulation and portable power.  Turning to total company online sales. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 5% compared to the third quarter of last year. We continued to invest in the digital experience across our website and app and released a variety of enhancements in the third quarter. These range from simple improvements to help customers track orders to more complex things like updating our search and recommendation algorithms. For those customers that transacted with us online during the third quarter nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores.  During the third quarter, we hosted our Annual Labor Day appliance in Halloween events, and we're pleased with the results. In appliances, we were encouraged with the customers' engagement during the event. And 2023 was another record sales year for our Halloween program, both in-store and online, as our customers continued to add to their collection with our unique and exclusive product assortment.  As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we intend to continue this momentum with our annual holiday, Black Friday and gift center events. In our gift center, we continued to lean into brands that matter most for our customers with our assortment of Milwaukee, RYOBI, Makita, DEWALT, RIDGID, Husky and more. We will have something for everyone, whether it's our wide assortment of cordless RYOBI tools, DEWALT Atomic Drill and impact kits or our new Milwaukee M18 FORGE batteries. These new M18 FORGE batteries will be a game changer for our Pro customer, providing the most powerful fastest-charging and longest life of any battery on the Milwaukee M18 platform.  This quarter, I'm also excited to announce the addition of WAGO to our powerhouse assortment of Pro brands including Milwaukee, USG, Custom Building Products, Leviton and QEP to name a few. It is these strategic vendor relationships that make us the product authority in home improvement and the addition of WAGO will help extend our position. WAGO is one of the top requested most innovative Pro brands in the wire connector segment that features a releasable level log wire connector that speeds up installation and save space in tight applications.  We recently launched a number of SKUs in our stores, which are exclusive to The Home Depot in the national big box retail channel.  Our merchandising organization remains focused on being our customers' advocate for value. This means continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in stock and available for our customers when they need it. We will also continue to lean into products that simplify the project, saving our customers time and money. That's why I'm so excited about the innovation we continue to bring to the market.  With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, total sales were $37.7 billion, a decrease of approximately $1.2 billion or 3% from last year.  During the third quarter, our total company comps were negative 3.1% with comps of negative 2.1% in August, negative 3.4% in September and negative 3.7% in October. Comps in the U.S. were negative 3.5% for the quarter with comps of negative 2.5% in August, negative 3.8% in September and negative 4.1% in October.  In local currency, Mexico and Canada posted comps above the company average. It is important to note that adjusting for storm-related overlaps and some seasonal shift, monthly comps were relatively consistent across the quarter.  In the third quarter, our gross margin was 33.8%, a decrease of approximately 20 basis points from the third quarter last year, which was in line with our expectations.  During the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 120 basis points to 19.4% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Our operating expense performance during the third quarter reflects our previously executed compensation increases for hourly associates as well as deleverage from our top line results.  Our operating margin for the third quarter was 14.3% compared to 15.8% in the third quarter of 2022.  Interest and other expense for the third quarter increased by approximately $30 million to $438 million.  In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.3%, down from 24.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.  Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.81, a decrease of 10.1% compared to the third quarter of 2022.  During the third quarter, we opened 7 new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,333. Retail selling square footage was approximately 242 million square feet.  At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $22.8 billion, down $2.9 billion or 11% compared to the third quarter of 2022. And inventory turns were 4.3x flat to 1 year ago.  Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.  During the quarter, we invested approximately $670 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.  Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 38.7%, down from 43.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.  Now I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2023. As you heard from Ted, with one quarter remaining in fiscal 2023, we no longer expect the end points of our previous guidance range as likely outcomes, and therefore, we are narrowing our guidance for 2023.  We expect fiscal 2023 sales and comp sales to decline between 3% and 4%. We are targeting an operating margin between 14.2% and 14.1% for the year.  Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion. And we are anticipating between a 9% and 11% decline in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2022.  In addition, as you heard from Ann, we continue to focus on driving productivity in the business. We have taken a number of actions that will help us realize the previously announced $500 million in annualized cost savings in 2024 and are fully confident that we will deliver on this commitment.  We also remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers with our leading product authority in home improvement, strong in-stock levels and knowledgeable associates. We will continue to prudently invest to strengthen our competitive position and leverage our scale and low-cost position to outperform our market and deliver shareholder value.  Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: In thinking about inflections and when we might see one, looking at the spread maybe between DIY and Pro is the story of this quarter that maybe DIY has stabilized, but the Pro is getting a little bit worse?  And then if that's right, and feel free to correct if that's wrong, would that mean that it could take a little longer than for the Pro sort of normalizing to play out? And actually, the overall comp could get a little worse before it gets better?\nEdward Decker: Thanks for the question. I would say Pro and consumer, it had the narrowest performance gap in some time. So they both performed reasonably well. If you step back and look at the quarter, we feel really good about the third quarter and we narrowed our comp guidance for the year because of that. And in fact, if you look at the performance of the business overall this year, if you look at the seasonality of Q1 and Q2, we're pretty smooth in that minus 3% comp through the first 3 quarters of this year, and that's normalized for weather and storms and commodity price deflation.  And then our regional businesses are also pretty consistent. We've seen the least variability in regions. And as I said, the narrowest gap between Pro and consumer. We had really good seasonal sell-through. And as prices have settled with abating deflation, we feel pretty good about that. And our operations are increasingly getting back to normal. The supply chain is operating very well. Our inventory positions are better. Our in-stock rates are much better, as Ann took you through all the things we're doing in the store to improve on-shelf availability. Our value propositions, as Billy mentioned, are in great shape and product innovation is better than it's ever been. And the wage investments are paying off. Our attrition is way down. And with that attrition being down, our associates have had more time in the store, their ability to serve customers has improved.  So all of that really is what delivered that consistent comp throughout the year. But to answer your specific question, as we sit here feeling really good about the operations, the share shift of PCE from pre-COVID to today has not completely reverted and we're still not exactly sure where that reverts to. The asset class for home improvement is worth $15-odd trillion more than it was pre-pandemic. And we know now that the Fed definitely has a higher-for-longer monetary posture and that's going to continue to pressure durable goods, in financing or motivation for larger home improvement projects.  So as we said, we see great engagement, engagement in seasonal goods, engagement with smaller projects. It's the larger projects are a bit down at the moment. So that's what we're watching. I mean we're not obviously talking about 2024 today, but lots of good news in the operations of the business. Great news with still a very resilient customer. I mean we just came off of 4.9% GDP in Q3, driven by the consumer. But as you know, we're looking at it this year, this period of moderation for home improvement spend. But I couldn't feel better about the business and our operations overall.\nSimeon Gutman: And then maybe the follow-up, you mentioned GDP. Given that home prices seem to be pretty sticky even with pretty weak turnover and may not get any better, how should we think about GDP -- should we revert to GDP as maybe a better proxy for how the business could do?\nRichard McPhail: Simeon, this is Richard. We have tried to take the most thoughtful approach possible in -- over the last few years of what the drivers of the business are and those things that indicate to us how we have settled back out of the pandemic period, and that's why we focused on share of PCE.  Like Ted said, we're not going to talk about 2024 today. There is an underlying kind of layer of economic activity that supports the business. But as Ted pointed out, number one, we still haven't reverted all the way back to 2019 levels of PCE share. And the Fed stance of higher-for-longer has had and could have increasing pressure on the outlook for durables and housing-related spend.  So like Ted said, that's what we're watching at the moment. And we will talk about 2024 when we get to our call next quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.\nZachary Fadem: Richard, considering all the ins and outs of your cost base this year with wage investments, you've got the legal settlement in Q1 plus the cost saves next year, is it fair for us to assume your operating margins can expand in 2024? Or is there a certain level of comp that you will need to see to hold this 14%-plus margin?\nRichard McPhail: Thanks for that question. Margin expansion is largely a function of top line growth. There is a point there in the low positive comp digits where you see expense turn from deleverage to leverage.  We're not going to take on 2024 guidance today. What we have done is we have put in place measures, and in fact, now have essentially completed actions that will provide us with a $500 million cost buffer heading into 2024. And so regardless of the outlook, that provides some buffer in margin.\nZachary Fadem: Got it. And then you mentioned that you would reinvest the legal settlement gain from Q1. So first of all, any color on what this reinvestment actually is or what it would look like? And then is it fair to say the investment will be largely in Q4? Or was there a part of that in Q3?\nRichard McPhail: We've had part of that spent throughout the year. I think it is still a correct assumption that, that favorability will be fully offset by the end of the year. And so I really point you to our guidance as the best jumping off point for your modeling.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.\nScot Ciccarelli: So in some other retail verticals or a lot of other retail verticals, we're seeing a return to pre-COVID purchasing patterns where you probably see more activity, purchasing activity on weekends and around holidays and events with, frankly, bigger lulls in between.  So the questions are: one, are you seeing a similar general pattern? And two, assuming that is the case, are there ways for you guys to take advantage of that pattern from an operational standpoint to improve productivity?\nWilliam Bastek: Yes. Thanks for the question, Scot. It's Billy. Listen, if it relates to different fluctuations in customer patterns and so forth, we haven't seen that. It's been very consistent throughout the quarter. And as Ted mentioned in his prepared remarks, really throughout the year when you account for some of the weather and some of the best effect we saw in the first half. So we haven't seen that.  Listen, if it relates to promotional activity whatsoever. We have events in our stores that we love to execute and drive excitement for our customers. But from a promotional activity standpoint, it's really reverted back to pre-COVID times. Our pricing is certainly, as Ted mentioned, settled over the last several months. The environment certainly stabilized. So we operate in a very -- we operate in a very rational market and promotional environment. As I said, this has returned to kind of pre-pandemic times.\nEdward Decker: And we will always -- Scot, we will always focus on EDLP. I mean we have events during certain seasons that they're a lot of fun. They're engaging with the associates. They're engaging for our customers. But day in and day out, 12 months a year, we strive to be an EDLP retailer with great values every day.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. On the big-ticket discretionary, is there any specific areas where you're actually seeing a positive inflection? Or are they all still trending, call it, mid-single-digit negative?\nRichard McPhail: No. We called out in my prepared remarks, categories like portable power and so forth, where we have seen great engagement. And candidly, we're thrilled with the innovation that we continue to partner with our supplier base on that we bring to the market. And where we continue to see innovation, we continue to see great engagement with both the Pro and the consumer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers: So a couple of follow-ups to prior questions. My first one is, with the gross margin decline in the third quarter, can you talk a little bit about what drove that? You were lapping storm-related demand and you had some commodity deflation. So I would have thought that those would be positive. So is that fair?  And what were the offsets to that drove it lower?\nRichard McPhail: Thanks for the question, Chris. I'll go back to Billy's comments and Ted mentioned this as well, I think the most important observation we've made is that the worst of the inflationary environment is behind us. And as a result, as Billy said, retail prices are settling in the market. Some prices are settling at levels higher than 2022, others are settling lower. But we're seeing some stabilization there that Billy can talk about. Specific to the quarter and gross margin, there are some timing differences as some prices settled ahead of anticipated product and transportation cost benefits that will come through as we turn through our inventory. But those are -- I'd really sort of consider those timing.  For the full year, our view on gross margin hasn't changed and we expect to see slight pressure year-over-year. But Billy, maybe just talk about kind of the settling of prices.\nWilliam Bastek: Yes. I mean, as you mentioned, the inflation environment seems to be behind us. Prices absolutely settled in. And again, I reiterate what I said, work in a very rational market.  And the other thing I'd add is this is no different than any other time frame, frankly. We have a portfolio approach to how we take on, whether it's lumber deflation that we've talked a lot about throughout the year or other ins and outs as it relates to the P&L. So a very normalized environment, rational and really a stabilization that we've seen across the board as it relates to pricing.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Got it, got it, got it. So that makes sense. And then on the variable cost side, you talked about a low single-digit leverage point historically and the $500 million of cost savings next year. You've had -- at the same time, you've had negative transactions for quite some time now.  So can you talk about where we are in terms of the -- how labor can maybe become -- how it becomes less variable over time, maybe in the context of the percentage of stores on minimum staffing levels. And if there is negative comps in '24 or over the next 6 months, is the flexibility that you get from the $500 million offset by the fact that you'll be -- you could be having still negative transactions and less flexibility.\nRichard McPhail: Chris, thanks for the question. There's a lot of kind of 2024 conjecture built into that answer. I'll tell you that -- you're right. So I think when you're talking about changes in the nature of our labor model, the degree of change in transactions really isn't material enough to say that changes the nature of our labor model.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: You talked about the promotional environment discounting being very rational. If the cycle or the downturn for home improvement remains protracted and extended, under what conditions would you expect that discounting will be more intense than it was in 2019 across the industry?  And if that were to be the case, would Home Depot choose to remain true to the everyday low price and the portfolio approach that it has or would it look to protect market share and participate in some of that activity?\nEdward Decker: We will stay committed to EDLP. And our promotional cadences, as we said earlier, the Black Friday, appliances and gift center and some spring events for seasonal garden items to get traffic in stores, those have been the playbook for years and years, right, Billy, and we don't see us going away from that. In fact, we've stayed truer to reductions of promotions when you think of categories like ceiling fans that I remember was constantly on and off 10% and 20% off. Paint, which was a promotional category, were 5% and 10% and then it went to 10% and 20s, we've backed off all of that. And on the margin, we prefer to be even less promotional than we are today.  If you had a protracted downturn in the market, I mean, for sure, we're going to be competitive. And for sure, we are going to protect our share. But when you think of the nature of large home improvement projects, certainly one done by a pro, the labor component is such a big piece of that job. I mean just take paint, for example. If you're painting your living room for $500, the paint in that job is going to be less than $100 and it's your labor bill, either your opportunity cost as a consumer or the pro doing your job for you.  So being super aggressive to take $10 off the $100 component of a $500 job I don't think really moves the needle, and that's why our bias, our starting position would be no, we wouldn't chase a lot of price in that dynamic.\nMichael Lasser: Got you. Very helpful. My follow-up question is, historically, Home Depot has underpromised and overdelivered in just about all facets. Is it realistic to think that you took the same approach when building this $500 million of net cost savings for next year such that there could be upside to that number?\nRichard McPhail: Well, that cost number was really more a function of having built capacity to handle the explosion in our volume during COVID.  And then the sort of other side of that pill, where we pulled capacity in many forms back. And so it was the right thing to do regardless of the environment. It does happen to provide a buffer for our operating margin as we move into 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi.\nSteven Zaccone: Congrats on the new role. I wanted to focus on the Pro side of the business. So the commentary about growing with the complex Pro. In the past, there's been a focus on the flatbed distribution centers and the rollout on a regional basis. Is that still very much the strategy for the next couple of years?  And as you zoom out and think about the opportunity with the complex Pro, what are the top priorities within those next 1 to 2 years?\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Steven, thank you so much for the kind words there. Chip is in the room, and he has been intimately knowledgeable about that. And so I'm going to throw it over to Chip, and he'll talk a little bit about some of the capabilities that we continue to leverage and some of the functionalities and capabilities that we will continue to build.\nChip Devine: Yes. Thank you, Steven. We are going to continue certainly our march down to the expansion of our outside sales teams and continue to grow the complex Pro as it was mentioned in the earlier remarks, the connectivity into the store is an important part of this asset build as well. Our Pros shop in our stores every single day and connecting that ecosystem to our flatbed delivery systems is part of that.  So as we look and expand into different markets as we move forward from where we currently are, we will continue to evaluate the best opportunity to expand those distribution assets as well to support our growth in Pro.\nSteven Zaccone: Okay. I wanted to revisit Simeon's question about inflection because I know it's a challenging backdrop to predict. But I guess as you think about the business, what are the key building blocks to take the business from this period of moderation to a more stable market backdrop when you talked about low single-digit market growth? I'm curious if you could opine on, is it really the PCE shift? Is it rates? Just any help you provide would be helpful.\nEdward Decker: Yes, Steven, for that, we're always looking at a balance between ticket and transactions. And what was interesting during the COVID period, we had inflation. So we had AUR up and we had ticket up, also driven by basket size.  But the engagement was so high, you really didn't have elasticities. You had driving ticket in transactions, and that's what led to the 25% comp.  As inflation has abated in primarily commodities and those prices have come down, you've seen a falloff in ticket. And you didn't get the elasticity initially that you'd expect, and that was because people were still powering through projects.  And now it's a mix of what's the level of response from pricing versus pull forward versus the Fed stance and higher interest rates. So that's all the dynamic that it's muddying the traditional ticket and transaction dynamic.  But what's healthy for us is a solid comp equally balanced between ticket and transactions. And that's what we'd be looking for. And now as we've said, prices have essentially leveled. Our ticket was down modestly. And if you take out commodity, our ticket would have been up for the quarter. And then transactions, we're still working through a bit of that PCE shift pull forward, whatever that dynamic might be. But we'd be looking for growth in each in a nice balance going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: The question I have, I think Michael may have asked previously just about price actions, but I guess maybe to expand that a bit further. So we've been discussing now this trend and weakness in bigger tickets for a while. I mean, obviously, a very unique demand backdrop.  But again, from your perspective, particularly as you look towards '24, are there other levers that Home Depot could pull to potentially spur better demand within big-ticket other than price?\nEdward Decker: Well, the number one way that we're focused to drive demand is with the complex Pro. So it's -- that is our key strategy and that's what we're focused on. It's a $200 billion space as we've defined the $950 billion split evenly pro and consumer. And if the $475 billion that's Pro, there's $200 billion that is larger pros, more complex spend that we're building out the capabilities to serve that demand.  And that, Brian, is what we're very, very focused on and I think for years and years, that is going to be a driver of our business as we take share in that sort of $200 billion white space.\nBrian Nagel: Thanks, Ted. Got it. And then my second -- my follow-up, much quicker. Obviously, you narrowed your guidance for the balance of the year. You talked about trends in the fiscal third quarter. But any commentary on sales trends early here in fiscal Q4?\nRichard McPhail: Our performance in the first 2 weeks is on track to achieve our full year 2023 guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird.\nPeter Benedict: Another one on average ticket here. So pre-COVID average ticket around $67. I think now it's kind of trending closer to $90, so up 35%.  Richard, I just wonder if you have any perspective on kind of the like-for-like SKU inflation component there versus the big-ticket mix? It sounds like your like-for-like inflation is -- seems to be stabilizing. I know there's innovation that can make things not like-for-like. But just curious, as you think about the big-ticket exposure there and what could potentially play out there? How big of a deal is that?\nRichard McPhail: Thanks for the question. I think there are a few answers to that.  First of all, we have seen inflation abate and really kind of settle on a like-for-like basis across the portfolio. I think it's interesting you see some -- we've seen different dynamics in big-ticket over the years as we've had lumber inflation and deflation, in particular, skewing those results in big ticket.  But Billy, maybe you talk a little bit about trends there.\nWilliam Bastek: Yes. I mean -- and I'll just -- Ted's response back to Brian on you see categories like drywall where we have capabilities, roofing, insulation, portable power where we've added innovation, we continue to see great both Pro and consumer reaction to just the innovation and things we're seeing.  As it relates to big-ticket, obviously, you've seen some deferral and so forth, as we talked about. Certainly, the pull forward is probably still playing a part in that as we continue to get further away from the pandemic.  So we'll watch that closely. We don't see anything. As I mentioned, stabilized pricing, rational environment and we don't see anything different from what we've seen over the last multiple months now.\nPeter Benedict: Okay. Thanks for that guide. And then I just -- I guess, turning to maybe the leverage and the pace of buyback. And if we stay in this environment of, let's call it, moderation in demand, how do you think about just maybe balancing your buyback approach leverage? I mean, you're still operating below the 2x. Is there anything that prevents you from kind of moving up to that 2x?  Are you -- just kind of curious on your latest thoughts around those topics.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you. We've maintained a position very close to that 2x debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio and we intend to do so in the foreseeable future. We will also really maintain consistency with respect to capital allocation. We invest in the business first. We pay our dividends. And then as we determine excess cash, we flow that to our shareholders in the form of repurchases.  To your point, to date, we've repurchased $6.5 billion. There's really no change in our stance. And so I think that's the important takeaway there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Just thinking about the fourth quarter, if we take the midpoint of the implied guidance, it does suggest a little bit of a deceleration yet. It does seem like your business has been consistent. Is that just a function of -- am I reading too much into that? Or do we expect a deceleration?  And maybe a second part of that, as you said, Halloween was really strong. Historically, all into your trim a tree or your holiday decorating business. I think it's like in 10 of the last 14 years, your fourth quarter comp has been better than the third quarter. Why should this year be different than that?\nRichard McPhail: Thanks for the question. The narrowing of the range is truly what it is. We saw the extreme points of that range become less likely and so we felt it would be helpful for our investors for us to narrow that range.  There has been an assumption all year from the beginning of the year that our guidance reflected a reversion of our share of PCE from the pandemic time period back to 2019 levels. Our prior guidance range assumes that, that share will continue to revert throughout the year. We've seen that reversion gradually and steadily. And our current range still has an assumption built in for Q4. We're largely reverted, but not all the way back. So there is some notion of that in our guide.\nMichael Baker: Okay. So sounds like it's -- like I said, it's just a function of getting to the middle of the range.  If I could ask one other question. You talked a little bit about storms and seasonality. I think a lot of retailers have said it's been a warm fall. How does that impact you? Do you need it to get cold in -- as we go through the fourth quarter to drive your business? How should we think about that?\nRichard McPhail: It's been a little warmer, obviously, but not a big impact. We started to see where the weather has normalized. We started to see some of that fall cleanup and fall business really take off. Haven't seen obviously snow and so forth.  So it's kind of right in line with what we'd say is a little more normalized year and where you see the weather act a little more fallish. You've seen the categories and businesses that you'd expect to trend up -- trend in that positive direction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim.\nSteven Forbes: Tad, or maybe for Ann, just a follow-up on Pro sales, really focusing on the Dallas market, what's the chain average. Can you update us on how that market is performing?  And then maybe just comment on any behavioral differences that you're noting between Pro markets based on the maturity of your strategic initiatives focused on the complex Pro. I mean, can you -- are you seeing and being able to analyze very like predictable behavioral changes?\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Yes. I'll start off by just saying that the capabilities and functionalities that Hector and Chip have been working on over the last several years are certainly going to help us engineer a deal of momentum and success with the Pro. And Chip, I'll throw it over to you again because of how intimately you are knowledgeable about that.  But there is -- this is -- the Pro ecosystem is what we are focused on. Now -- and not the in-store side -- or not only the in-store side, but the complex Pro. And as we build out these capabilities and we see the effectiveness of these capabilities, we're going to continue to leverage those. And Chip, I'll throw it over to you to kind of give a little bit more details on Dallas.\nChip Devine: Yes. Thanks, Ann. And Steven, yes, absolutely, where we built capabilities inclusive of assets, distribution assets and where we've expanded our sales force, we've seen meaningful impact in growth. Our outside sales team is the best-performing cohort of all Pro. So we're going to continue, as I mentioned before, to invest in that and then add assets where necessary in the appropriate markets.\nSteven Forbes: Maybe just a quick follow-up for Richard or Billy, all the ticket conversations here, any way to just sum up how the quarter for big-ticket progressed relative to expectations? It sounds like it performed better than expected. You have sort of stabilization in multiyear big-ticket comp trends. I would imagine that wasn't the expectation. But any way to help us frame on how the quarter progressed for big-ticket versus internal plan?\nWilliam Bastek: Yes. I think listen, it was largely how we planned it. We -- I called out some great interaction from our consumers is it related to appliances. Having said that, we were in a better inventory position there. So we saw some tailwind from just our better inventory position as it relates to that. But it largely played out exactly how we had thought it would.  And really, again, back to the prior comments, a very balanced year across the board when you account for some of the weather shifts early on and then what we were lapping with the hurricane, very balanced across the board and across the regions.\nRichard McPhail: I think it's important to thematically just to sort of repeat the point, this stance by the Fed of higher for longer is sort of coming across in surveys. There is a deferral of larger projects. And so if you just want to zoom all the way back to the true macro here and the forces on ticket that we're watching, that's probably the largest macro for us.\nWilliam Bastek: That's right.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Dean Rosenblum with Bernstein.\nDean Rosenblum: My question is about the Pro and really just understanding the performance of the Pro relative to the comp overall and then splitting that out between store sales to Pro versus complex project sales to Pro.  So just to make sure I'm understanding, you put up, call it, a negative 3% comp. DIY and Pro, very close to one another, U.S. slightly worse than Canada and Mexico. So I'm assuming U.S. Pro, call it, down 2%, 2.5%? And then can you just either verify or correct that. And then can you characterize Pro sales in the store relative to Pro sales outside of the store through the outside sales force and the CFCs?\nRichard McPhail: Well, taking your last part first, it's an ecosystem like Ann said. We're actually not we don't have goals or targets with respect to the separation of store and delivered sales. The point is actually lifting all sales. And that's what we've seen consistently in every market where we've rolled out capabilities.  Originally, we worried, okay, our delivered sales is going to begin to cannibalize the store. The opposite has proven true. And so we are progressing in a way that we're pleased.  With respect to your first question, factually, the Pro did outperform the consumer in Q3, albeit at the narrowest margin we've seen in quite some time. If you actually normalize for commodity impact, the Pro was essentially flat for the quarter.\nDean Rosenblum: Okay. Great. And I guess my follow-up would be when you guys measure big project versus small projects, can you just clarify for us how you're determining what constitutes a big project versus a small? Is it like transaction size over $1,000? And if you could clarify that for us, that would be great.\nRichard McPhail: We infer from category sales and from class sales. When you look at categories that are more likely to sell at higher volumes in larger projects, kitchens, flooring, millwork to an extent, we are doing some inference. We also ask our customers what they're seeing and what kind of projects they're working on. We use external survey data that tells us that the nature of projects is kind of shifting from larger to smaller. And so it's a triangulation.\nOperator: Ms. Janci, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-08-15 13:15:24", "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to The Home Depot Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christie and good morning everyone. Welcome to Home Depot\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President and CEO; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; Ann-Marie Campbell, Executive Vice President of U.S. Stores and International Operations; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thank you, Isabel and good morning everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $42.9 billion, down 2% from the same period last year. Comp sales for the total company as well as our U.S. stores also declined 2% from the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $4.65 in the second quarter compared to $5.05 in the second quarter last year. All three of our U.S. divisions posted low single-digit negative comps in the quarter. Our geographic variability narrowed significantly on a sequential basis as weather normalized, particularly in our Western division and spring-related categories rebounded relative to the first quarter. While there was strength in project-related categories like building materials, hardware and plumbing, we continue to see pressure in certain big ticket discretionary categories. Pro sales performance was slightly negative in the second quarter and outperformed the DIY customer. While surveys suggest that Pro backlogs are lower than they were a year ago, they are still healthy and elevated relative to historical norms. Additionally, projects in these backlogs are generally smaller in scale and scope. In the second quarter, we are pleased with the consumers\u2019 engagement with home improvement, particularly across small projects, which Billy will discuss in greater detail. Going forward, as we continue to navigate a unique and uncertain environment, our focus continues to be on operating with agility as we respond to evolving customer dynamics while also driving productivity and efficiency throughout the business. In addition and as we mentioned at our investor conference in June, we operate in a large and fragmented $950 billion plus addressable market. We remain committed to growing the business and believe we are well positioned to continue capturing market share. To that end, I am pleased to announce HD Supply\u2019s acquisition of Redi Carpet, a national MRO flooring provider with a proven track record. This acquisition, which closed at the beginning of the third quarter, extends our current product offering in the multifamily customer vertical with 34 locations strategically located throughout the U.S. Our team will continue to focus on what is most important: our associates and customers. Our merchants, store and met teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter. And I\u2019d like to thank them for their dedication and hard work. Before I close, I would like to send our thoughts and prayers to the people of Maui. While we are thankful that our people on the island are all accounted for, we are heartbroken by the loss of life and extreme devastation that the community must now navigate and we stand ready to help in the days, months and years ahead. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Billy.\nBilly Bastek: Thank you, Ted and good morning everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. In the second quarter, as we saw weather improve across the country, most notably in our Western division, we saw an increase in spring sales and strength in smaller-ticket projects. In addition, we saw a continuation of the trend we observed starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 with softness in certain big-ticket, discretionary-type purchases. Turning to our department comp performance for the second quarter, 6 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps, including building materials, outdoor garden, hardware, plumbing, tools and millwork. During the second quarter, our comp average ticket was slightly positive and comp transactions decreased 2%. Excluding core commodities, comp average ticket was primarily impacted by inflation across several product categories as well as demand for new and innovative products. Deflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 160 basis points during the second quarter driven by deflation in lumber. During the second quarter, we saw a significant decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago. As an example, on average, framing lumber was approximately $420 per thousand board feet compared to approximately $715 in the second quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of over 40%. Turning to total company online sales. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 1% compared to the second quarter of last year. We\u2019re excited about our customer engagement across our interconnected platforms as we continue to remove friction from the experience. We know the vast majority of our customers engage with us in an interconnected manner. Whether it be through project inspiration and research, transacting, fulfillment or support, our customers blend the physical and digital world. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the second quarter, nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores. During the second quarter, Pro sales were slightly negative and outpaced the DIY customer. While surveys suggest that Pro backlogs are lower than they were a year ago, they are still healthy and elevated relative to historical norms. And in the second quarter, we saw strength across many Pro-heavy categories like gypsum, fasteners and insulation. In addition, we continue to see strength across smaller projects with positive comp performance in a number of categories, including live goods, hardscapes and landscapes. Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were down 5.5% compared to the second quarter of last year. After 3 years of unprecedented demand in the home improvement market, we continue to see softer engagement in big-ticket discretionary categories like patio and appliances that likely reflects both pull-forward of these single item purchases and deferrals. Our merchandising organization remains focused on being our customers advocate for value. This means continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in-stock and available for our customers when they need it. We will also continue to lean into products that simplify the project, saving our customers time and money. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about the innovation we continue to bring to the market. This quarter, we are excited to announce the addition of the Milwaukee brand to our assortment of electrical hand tools. Within this assortment, we will be introducing a brand-new line of innovative Milwaukee hand tools that provide a high degree of precision with lasting results for our Pro customers. We\u2019ve already seen positive results with our Pro customers and feel confident that the addition of these Milwaukee tools will strengthen our position as the number one destination for the electrical trade in the big-box retail channel. Additionally, in kitchen and bath, we continue to bring innovation to the market with Glacier Bay. Glacier Bay is one of The Home Depot\u2019s top proprietary brands known for performance and style. This fall, we are excited to grow our faucet lineup to include innovative functionalities, such as touchless and spring neck designs, add to our assortment of sinks and shower heads, while also expanding into new categories like disposals. We are also extremely excited about our lineup for Halloween. Our merchants have worked with our supplier partners to put together an expanded assortment of product offerings for this Halloween season, including the return of many fan favorites as well as new collections for the Halloween enthusiasts. These products bring excitement to our stores and help drive traffic. And our sneak preview of our Halloween lineup was a tremendous success. We are thrilled for the full rollout in the coming weeks. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ann.\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Thanks, Billy, and good morning, everyone. Our store teams have a relentless focus on cultivating the best customer experience in home improvement. We know that our associates are a key differentiator and they are essential in helping us sustain the customer experience we strive for. In order to provide the best customer experience in home improvement, we must focus on cultivating the best associate experience in retail. This means not only investing in competitive wages and benefits but also providing tools, training and development opportunities that make working at The Home Depot an endurable and rewarding experience. I am happy to share that our approximately $1 billion of annualized compensation investment that we announced earlier this year is having the intended effects. This quarter, we continued to see meaningful improvement in our attrition rates, particularly among our most tenured associates. More consistent staffing levels are resulting in improved customer service, productivity and safety. These improvements are exactly what we set out to achieve with this wage investment. In addition to investing in our associates, we must also leverage technology to further simplify both the associate and customer experience. As you heard at our investor and analyst conference in June, our customers journeys differ. Depending on the project they are working on, they shop with us in different ways. There is the unassisted cash-and-carry purchase, which represents a significant majority of our in-store sales. And the remaining sales are assisted purchases, where customers need help in purchasing a product, a service or installation. It is critical that we have the right products in-stock in the right quantity and on the shelf available for purchase, particularly for unassisted sales. That\u2019s why you hear us talk about our focus on improving our on-shelf availability, or OSA, positions. We are working to narrow the gap between what is considered in-stock, meaning our systems indicate it is in-store versus on the shelf and available for sale for the customer. We are doing this by starting to leverage new technology such as computer vision. Computer vision enables technology to do what we previously relied on associate eyes to do and provide specific locations of depalletized product that is stored in our overhead. To start, associates will take a picture of bays using their HD phones. These images then feeds into our systems and provide a single real-time view of inventory that can then seamlessly integrate into applications like Sidekick. Powered by machine learning, Sidekick directs associates to key bays where OSA is low or out exists. This helps our teams prioritize the highest-value task inside their respective stores. The beauty of the machine learning model is that the algorithm is continuously learning as computer vision images are captured and Sidekick tasks are completed. So it will get better and better at directing our associates to the right bay at the right time. While it\u2019s early days, as we have begun implementing this technology, we have seen meaningful improvements in OSA, increased associate engagement and productivity and higher customer service scores.\nOrder Up 14:54: Not only does Order Up make it easier to fulfill a customer\u2019s needs, but it also frees up more time for associates to spend serving customers that needs assistance while in our stores. These enhancements have made the average Order Up experience over 40% faster for the customer, which has led to improved customer service scores. These initiatives are just a few examples of the many different types of projects that can drive significant impact for customers, our associates and shareholders. I am so excited about all that our store teams are doing to focus on both the customer and associate experience. None of this would be possible without our amazing associates, and I want to thank them for all they do to take care of our customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, total sales were $42.9 billion, a decrease of approximately $900 million or 2% from last year. During the second quarter, our total company comps were negative 2% with comps of negative 2.6% in May, negative 3.3% in June and negative 0.2% in July. Comps in the U.S. were negative 2% for the quarter with comps of negative 2.6% in May, negative 3.3% in June and negative 0.4% in July. As you heard from Billy, during the second quarter, we continued to experience lumber deflation compared to the prior year. While lumber prices were down, we saw an improvement in unit productivity, resulting in a net negative comp impact of approximately 85 basis points versus the second quarter of 2022. In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33%, a decrease of 8 basis points from the second quarter last year, primarily driven by pressure from shrink. During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 100 basis points to 17.6% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our operating expense performance during the second quarter reflects our previously executed compensation increases for hourly associates as well as deleverage from our top line results. Our operating margin for the second quarter was 15.4% compared to 16.5% in the second quarter of 2022. Interest and other expense for the second quarter increased by $49 million to $428 million due primarily to interest on our floating rate debt as well as higher debt balances than a year ago. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4%, up from 24.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.65, a decrease of 7.9% compared to the second quarter of 2022. During the second quarter, we opened two new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,326. Retail selling square footage was approximately 241 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $23.3 billion, down $2.8 billion compared to the second quarter of 2022. And inventory turns were 4.4x, down from 4.5x last year. Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $800 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 41.5%, down from 45.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Now I\u2019ll comment on our guidance for fiscal 2023. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2023. We expect fiscal 2023 sales and comp sales to decline between 2% and 5%. We are targeting an operating margin between 14.3% and 14% for the year. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion and we are anticipating between a 7% and 13% decline in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2022. In addition, we continue to focus on driving productivity in the business and feel confident that we will realize the previously announced $500 million in annualized cost savings in 2024. We also remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers with our leading product authority in home improvement, strong in-stock levels and knowledgeable associates. We will continue to prudently invest to strengthen our competitive position and leverage our scale and low-cost position to outperform our market and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I think the big question is for the industry, have we seen the bottom? You did a down 4.5% in the first quarter. You needed the down 2% in the second quarter. July was flat. So how are you thinking about the trends going forward? Was there anything in the second quarter that we shouldn\u2019t extrapolate on a go-forward basis, whether that was weather shift? Or was there something about July that benefited that month in particular?\nTed Decker: Good morning, Chris, it\u2019s Ted. The quick answer is, yes, July really was a weather shift. We had a particularly wet in cold June. And with that weather shift, the months of the second quarter were all sequentially about that same minus 2%. But to answer your question from a more macro perspective on where we see the industry and the demand, just start by saying, as you all know, we looked at 2023 as a year of moderation after the explosive growth we had the prior few years. And as we called out, consumers would be shifting their spending from goods to services. And while that shift is happening, the overall economy and the consumer in particular have remained incredibly resilient. As we all know, the economy continues to grow with a number \u2013 another great GDP print for the second quarter. And fears of a recession or at least a severe recession have largely subsided, and the consumer is generally healthy. There\u2019s PCE spending, continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate. And if you look at the home improvement customer, our core customer, the homeowner, they\u2019ve seen continued growth in home equity over the last several years, strong job growth and increases in wages. So the core customer remains strong. And if you look at Home Depot, you look at our operations, what we can specifically control, we feel great about where we are halfway through this year, as you saw, the meaningful reduction in inventory. We think our inventory positions are better placed than they\u2019ve been in the past few years. Our in-stock rates have continued to improve. Our value proposition remains strong. And as Ann called out, the wage investments are really paying off. But given all those positives and \u2013 that we were pleased in the second quarter, uncertainties remain, Chris. We don\u2019t know how quickly or further the share shift in PCE will occur and where spending in home improvement in particular will ultimately settle. And we don\u2019t know how the monetary policy actions which are specifically intended to dampen consumer demand, what that impact will ultimately have on consumer sentiment in the overall economy. And as I said, while we did see the sequential improvement in our comp sales, a lot of that was a seasonal recovery in the second quarter. And as I said, specifically in July, as well as the impact of lumber is beginning to abate. And as Billy called out, we do continue to see pressure in certain big-ticket, discretionary categories. So while there\u2019s a lot of positives in the macro and with the consumer, we still see enough uncertainty really largely driven by this PCE shift and where that ultimately lands, that we \u2013 well, again, we feel good. We just thought there was too much uncertainty to take, for example, revise our guidance from earlier in the year. But having said all of that, long answer, when we do get through this period of moderation, we remain incredibly bullish on the sector. We couldn\u2019t feel better about the macro for housing and home improvement and our prospects and ability to keep taking share in this huge and still largely fragmented market.\nChristopher Horvers: Thank you for that. My follow-up question is on the ticket side. I mean you are \u2013 if you run stacks or CAGRs on your average ticket, it did deteriorate in the second quarter relative to the first. So can you talk about the drivers of that? And how much of that is this shift to smaller-ticket projects accelerating, because you are going to start to lap through that ticket pressure in the fourth quarter. So is what you\u2019re seeing now indicative of that shift from large to small is accelerating, so we can\u2019t just assume that we sort of annualize that out in the fourth quarter?\nRichard McPhail: Well, Chris, this is Richard. First, just with respect to stacks and progression, what we\u2019re encouraged by is we\u2019re seeing \u2013 as cost pressures in our industry sort of abate, we\u2019re seeing ticket and transactions actually begin to converge. And we think that that\u2019s actually a healthy signal in the business. So I think that\u2019s the most macro comment that we could make about ticket progression. With respect to large versus small projects, certainly, our customers and our contractors tell us that there is some stance of deferral when it comes to large projects. Customers are opting for \u2013 they are more likely to opt for smaller versus larger, and that may have some impact on ticket. But we\u2019re also seeing the impacts of what we call softness in certain large-ticket discretionary item purchases like patio and appliances. So there\u2019s a lot going on there, but I think that the \u2013 maybe the most important dynamic is just kind of that nice recovery in transactions as both ticket and transactions begin to converge and normalize.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning, thank you so much for taking my question. Given this trend of small transactions coming in and maybe even replacing large transactions, is it more likely that you can take the low end of your guidance off the table of a down 5% comp for the year outside of some macroeconomic shock at this point?\nTed Decker: Well, Michael, I don\u2019t want to go through the answer I just went through with Chris but - that\u2019s pretty \u2013 that\u2019s pretty much laid out the view. I mean, again, we feel really good about the second quarter. Clearly, we like the sequential improvement. And as Richard said, the normalization in settling, if you will, of a much healthier balance of ticket and transactions. But there\u2019s still just a lot of uncertainty. Is the Fed going to raise? Are we going to get a budget deal passed? I mean there\u2019s so many things out there swirling that \u2013 we just updated or reaffirmed in June that we\u2019re just more comfortable standing pat right now.\nRichard McPhail: And the other thing just to at least know that we\u2019re watching is our share of PCE. We\u2019ve watched this since our sales spiked in 2020 as not a perfect measurement, but certainly a way to think contextually about what we saw during the 3 years of unprecedented growth. As predicted, we\u2019ve seen our share of PCE. As Ted mentioned, as we\u2019ve seen share shift from goods into services, we have also seen our share of PCE steadily revert back towards 2019 levels. When you think about the bottom end of our sales guidance, that actually corresponds with the math that would say if our share of PCE reverted all the way back to 2019 levels, that would imply the low end of the guidance. We don\u2019t see anything in our business today that tells us that that\u2019s the trajectory, but that is the math of our PCE share shift. And I\u2019d also just repeat, Ted, we\u2019re not sure where that share ultimately settles. The home is so much more important from a financial perspective for \u2013 you\u2019d say all homeowners than it was 3 years ago that perhaps there\u2019s an elevated level of home improvement spend in PCE versus prior years. We just don\u2019t know. But that low end of the range does correspond to the PCE share shift math.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. My follow-up question is Home Depot\u2019s operating expenses this year are being impacted by the $1 billion wage investment. But SG&A growth over the last few years has been anything but normal. So the key debate here is, has the company entered a period where the cost of doing business has just gone up such that even if the cycle recovers in 2024, the company won\u2019t see a significant improvement in its profitability because so much will need to be reinvested back in operating expenses based on what\u2019s happening right now?\nTed Decker: Well, I wouldn\u2019t paint that picture, Michael. Clearly, too early to talk about 2024. But we made a significant investment in wage, as Ann said, and we\u2019re in a much more comfortable position on a national minimum level and where we are in competitive markets. So again, as Ann mentioned, we couldn\u2019t feel better about the returns on that investment. We don\u2019t expect that we\u2019re going to need to make that outsize of an investment in the near-term planning horizon. Wage rates are still up, but we\u2019re seeing those come down. Annual increases that we track month-to-month, as I\u2019m sure you do, are moderating. So we don\u2019t see another big wage investment. And then this business, as it always does, will leverage with volume in those dynamics of this P&L leveraging with modest comps. That investment thesis remains intact.\nRichard McPhail: It might just do to remind, as we laid out in the investor conference, in a market-normalized case with 3% to 4% top line growth, in a normalized case, we expect margin expansion based on operating expense leverage that would lead to mid to high single-digit EPS growth. So nothing\u2019s really structurally changed that much, but it is worth just pointing back to our comments in June.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. Thank you so much. And good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. Can you help us unpack the cadence of DIY versus Pro from Q1 to Q2 as last quarter saw DIY outperform Pro for, I think, the first time in 2 years? And with that reversing out in Q2, curious how you think about the moving parts between the 2, and if we should expect the spread to widen or contract going forward.\nTed Decker: Zach, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. There was so much noise in Q1 that I\u2019d just say that was an outlier. And the theme of the Pro responding to the investments we\u2019re making in outperforming the consumer that we just saw in Q2 is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen. But for an outlier, very noisy Q1.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And Richard, you had talked about the $500 million in cost savings next year coming out of the base. But I believe there\u2019s also about 10 to 20 bps of productivity benefit this year. And I\u2019m hoping you could speak to, first of all, the differences between the two and the buckets of savings and then whether that 10 to 20 bps for this year is in the base today or if it builds through the year.\nRichard McPhail: Sure. Zack, thanks. Yes, that 10 to 20 is something we called out at the very beginning of the year when we \u2013 or \u2013 and actually Q \u2013 when we talked about the progression of margin. And so \u2013 or rather the range of operating margin outcomes. That \u2013 you can think of that as really productivity that we anticipate in ordinary course. It certainly offset expenses such as the wage investment, but it was part of our original guidance and consistent with revised guidance in Q1 and consistent with guidance today. The $500 million cost-out that we anticipate for 2024 is separate. And it really reflects our \u2013 the rationalization in most part of a cost structure that we had to build up as we saw product volume skyrocket in 2020 and 2021. So we built a cost structure that isn\u2019t necessary today in today\u2019s volumes. And so we will rationalize some of that cost structure. A good example would be a warehouse that we took a lease on to hold product during 2020 and 2021. We are looking at our real estate footprint, and some of that may well be rationalized. Those are the \u2013 and with that comes cost savings. That\u2019s the nature of the $500 million. Think about it as a permanent reduction in our fixed cost base.\nZach Fadem: And all these are SG&A, right? Just to confirm.\nRichard McPhail: There\u2019s probably some \u2013 there could be some geography in COGS and in operating expense, but we haven\u2019t settled in that yet. To your question, let me just make sure that we\u2019re clear, that initial 10 to 20 basis points of productivity is included in our operating margin guidance for 2023. No part of the $500 million is included in 2023. That is assumed full year benefit annualized in 2024.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Appreciate the time. Thanks, Richard. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question. \nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. You talked about relative strength in the smaller project spending, but in an environment with negative Pro sales and smaller Pro backlogs, how are you guys benchmarking your efforts to gain traction in the large and complex Pro business you\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about?\nHector Padilla: Scot, this is Hector. Good morning. As we mentioned in the investors\u2019 conference, what we are building as far as the ecosystem for the Pro, it is hard and it will take some time. Now the good news is that it will also be very hard to replicate, as you know. And today, we\u2019re very encouraged by the signals that we are getting from our Pro customers as they engage with different pieces of the ecosystem. We are in many markets today with the expanded ecosystem. There are pieces of the ecosystem that we don\u2019t have fully deployed. Think of our order management system or a trade credit. But we continue to gauge our performance with our Pros. Those Pros continue to engage not only in the supply chain assets that we have built and with our outside sales resources as we expanded that team, but they are visiting our stores in a more frequent basis. So we continue to be very encouraged by what that cohort is always performing, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in the efforts.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Got it. Thank you, Hector. And then just a second question. Inventory was down quite a bit even with the negative comp. Would you guys expect that to mark the bottom of your destocking process? Or should we expect inventory levels to continue to drop? Thanks.\nBilly Bastek: Well, we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made relative to our inventory position. And you think about everything that\u2019s happened in the supply chain and lead times associated with that has helped. Listen, we still have work to do to improve productivity. But we feel good about our inventory, and we have low obsolescence risk and super experienced merchant teams. So a lot of the dynamics in the supply chain helped us really. And at the same time, I might add, our in-stocks are better than they\u2019ve been since before the pandemic. So we\u2019re really pleased about the inventory productivity, but at the same time, our in-stocks, our ability to be in-stock below a feed as an called out or OSA. And so really pleased with both of those pieces.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. \nJackie Sussman: Hi, there. This is Jackie Sussman on for Simeon. Thanks so much for taking our question. You were speaking earlier on small projects replacing large projects. Can you drill into the backlog a bit more? How much have they come off of peak? How far above normal levels are they? And is there any evidence you\u2019re seeing that consumers are fully pushing off or canceling projects rather than just trading down? Thanks.\nRichard McPhail: Well, I\u2019ll start on that one. And if we rely on publicly published surveys, the one that we watch is the National Association of Homebuilders Index. We have seen backlogs declined sequentially. But yes, they are well above the historical average. And so you would really say the professional customer has been oversubscribed for so many years that they still have a full book of business, just not maybe oversubscribed. They may be taking phone calls again, but they are very healthy. Again, if you think about the historical average, and you can look this up, but historical average being a score for 50, the index is still at 61, so down from peak but higher than average.\nTed Decker: In addition to the publicly available indexes, obviously, we have millions of Pros and the field sales force that Hector mentioned. So anecdotally, we are getting loads of feedback from our customer base. They are still busy and engaged with those backlogs, but it\u2019s their commentary to our sales force that they are smaller. So, that\u2019s where we get the color on that dynamic.\nJackie Sussman: Got it. That\u2019s helpful color. And just one quick follow-up. Shrink was the only real call-out on the gross margin line, can you talk about how that trended in the quarter? Did it get worse or any better? And are there any actions that you are taking to kind of mitigate that impact going forward?\nRichard McPhail: From a financial perspective, shrink has been a consistent pressure over the last several quarters and even the last few years, and it\u2019s something we are tackling every day. And Ann, maybe talk a little bit\u2026\nAnn-Marie Campbell: No, we are certainly in the battle in retail as we kind of think about shrink. But we have always continued to lean into initiatives that we have seen that can have impact to mitigate overall. And I know it\u2019s early as we think about the Inform Act, but the Inform Act is one of the key components as we think about organized retail crime that I think will help give us a little bit more visibility in some of the things that are happening out there. But certainly, it\u2019s been largely in line with what we have seen in the last several quarters. We certainly have key initiatives to help mitigate that. And we need our kind of government partners to help on their end as well to help us in retail to really mitigate what we have seen out there.\nJackie Sussman: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Zaccone: Great. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I was hoping you could comment a bit more about the homeowner engagement that you talked about. It sounds like it was a bit of a sequential improvement. Was that largely weather-driven, or are you actually seeing some elasticity of demand as inflation eases in some categories?\nBilly Bastek: Yes. Thanks Steven. No, I think we articulated earlier about the weather patterns. We actually talked in Q1 about the impact that the West had. The West was our best-performing region, best-performing division for Q2. So, we saw a lot of that engagement back into those spring categories. We pushed a little bit around from June to July with some of the weather and the heat, as you saw more in ACs and fans. So, a much more normalized balance to the quarter outside of just some shifting of some of those smaller seasonal pieces.\nSteven Zaccone: Okay. Great. And then just a clarification on second half expectations, is there any difference in how you are thinking about the business in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter comps? And then maybe a more near-term question, if July benefited a bit from weather, how has August to-date trended? Is it fair to say you are kind of back within that full year guidance range?\nRichard McPhail: Right. So, the first two weeks of the third quarter have been a little better than our first half comp. But we have 24 weeks left in the year. So, we think the guidance range is appropriate.\nSteven Zaccone: Okay. And then just third quarter versus fourth quarter, should we just kind of look at the 1-year comparisons?\nRichard McPhail: We are not going to provide quarterly guidance. And again, we have got 24 weeks left in the year. So, we think the range is appropriate.\nSteven Zaccone: Okay. Thanks. Best of luck in the back half.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your questions.\nChuck Grom: Thanks very much. Great quarter. You committed to investing $1 billion in wages this year. But as comps and transactions have remained negative and the flexibility that you have with the transaction-based labor model, is there the potential for that full amount not to be realized or will you reinvest it in other parts of the business?\nRichard McPhail: Well, from a financial perspective, of course, there is an assumption around how many hours would be utilized during the year. There is something that has to be multiplied against the wage. But I wouldn\u2019t say this is a material. You are not going to see a material change in our financial profile. And again, our guidance is the best guideline for you to look out with respect to our annual \u2013 likely annual performance.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then for Ann, just can you elaborate a little bit more on the computer vision technology? How quickly is that going to be rolled out across the chain? And maybe elaborate on some of the benefits you think you could see in the near-term.\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Sure. So, first of all, we started with Sidekick application, which direct associates to pass down product from the overhead. And so Sidekick is a task to computer vision to help that associate see where the product in the overhead, so which is a complementary component to drive overall productivity. So, we are certainly bullish. We have that in our \u2013 a region that\u2019s fully rolled out already. We have that in what we consider pilot stores across every single region. And we expect that to be rolled out later this year. We are seeing some really, really good output finding product that takes a ton of time in our stores. So, I have been around for a long time, my neck looking up in the overhead trying to find product for customers, and we have thousands of associates that\u2019s doing that every day. So complementing, directing the task and then finding exactly where the product is in the overhead drives a ton of productivity for us, and we expect to roll that out later this year.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Thanks Ann.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, at the risk of being maybe a bit repetitive, I just \u2013 with regard to inflation, I guess maybe now disinflation, so we are starting to see \u2013 and I know you mentioned in your prepared comments the lumber price dynamic there where you have seen improved unit demand. But the question I have is as we are seeing or we are moving past maybe peak-ish inflation and getting more disinflation, how are you seeing the overall business flex here, both from a \u2013 I guess from what you are doing as well as how your consumers are reacting generally?\nTed Decker: I mean broadly on the inflation piece, well, we still expect that the overall year will have a net inflationary impact on our costs in retails. But as we go into the second half, it is moderating. And when you look at just the activity of cost increase requests, I mean they are negligible. I mean there are a couple. And we were in the billions of dollars at one point of cost in. And so net new requests for cost and certainly cost increases in the supply chain, that\u2019s all completely abated. As we go into the second half, when you think of product cost, transportation, overall transportation costs and then what would ultimately do in retails, inflation has certainly abated. Commodity is certainly down meaningfully from the peak as well as year-over-year as well as even shorter term. But beyond commodity and the fact that we don\u2019t have increased inflation, we are not expecting a deflationary environment. I think Richard used the term settling. We are kind of settling into these non-commodity price levels. And as the Pro and consumer customer has gotten used to those over the last few years, you are seeing the normalization in transactions, as Richard called out. So, we are encouraged that the cycle of inflation is essentially behind us. And Richard, I don\u2019t know if you \u2013 or Billy, if you have anything else to add to that.\nBilly Bastek: No. I would say we are encouraged by the improvement in transactions and as we see the normalized pieces that Richard spoke about earlier, but we don\u2019t see a deflationary environment as we go forward.\nBrian Nagel: That\u2019s very helpful. And then the second question I have and I know it\u2019s going to be a bit nuanced, but just to understand how your consumers really reacted here. So, as you look at the West Coast, you called out, I think is a point of strength in the quarter as weather maybe normalized a bit. But the question I have is as you are watching that consumer reengage with Home Depot amid more normal weather conditions, is there anything there surprising, or is the consumer coming back like you would normally expect with the weather shift like we have seen?\nBilly Bastek: Yes. I would say, Brian, that we commented out in Q1 because of the impact that we saw, and it played out precisely kind of how we thought in the West. As I mentioned, that was our best-performing division. Customers engaged heavily in our seasonal businesses that were so pressured into Q1. And so it really did play out precisely how we had thought.\nBrian Nagel: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nBilly Bastek: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thanks. Two, please, if I could. One, bigger picture. I think last quarter, maybe it was in the June Analyst Day, you said that you thought the housing market would be down mid to high-single digits in 2023. That was sort of the industry baseline. There has been some indicators of housing being a little bit better. Is that still the way you are thinking about the industry right now, it\u2019s down in that mid to high-single digit range?\nRichard McPhail: Well, we have said there are some economists who might call for that. We were uncertain, and that\u2019s really because when you look at supply and demand imbalances in the market, we have worked our way into a structural deficit of housing in North America. And what\u2019s interesting to us is you have actually seen sequential improvement month-over-month in home prices for the last four months. So, I think if you just look at observed data, home prices have for the most part, remained steady versus last year, and so better than many economists\u2019 predictions at the beginning of the year.\nMichael Baker: Okay. So \u2013 but has your view changed at all or too much uncertainty?\nRichard McPhail: We didn\u2019t ascribe any housing benefit to our guidance for 2023. And we think long-term, those supports for home improvement demand are there. And we do think that supply-demand imbalance is an important part of that, along with the aging of the housing stock. So again, we are bullish on the future of this market.\nTed Decker: Yes. I think the big story with housing now as it\u2019s playing out is values have held up. And Case-Shiller just came out with some data and Redfern just \u2013 Redfin just came out with some data that, that drop-off in values has been erased and that we are now back to record highs of home values in the United States and sequential improvement, as Richard just said. The near-term story in housing is that with so many people locked in to the incredibly low mortgage rates that there just isn\u2019t a lot of inventory available for sale. So, transactions are at certainly near-term lows in terms of nominal number of houses that are turning over in a percentage of the housing stock. So, many people are below 5%, even at 3% mortgage rates. So, values are holding if not now back increasing fundamental imbalance again of 2 million to 3 million to 4 million homes. And the issue is inventory. And people are getting used to it. We understand new buyers have sort of digested the increase in mortgage rates to the 7%-ish, but there is just not that much available to purchase.\nMichael Baker: Yes. Okay. It makes sense. Sorry, that was one question. The follow-up is this, if I could. You had said \u2013 I hate to be so short-term-focused, but August was better than the first half comps. But any comment on August versus the second quarter comps?\nRichard McPhail: Again, the first two weeks of the quarter were a little better than our first half comp. We have 24 weeks left. And so we just \u2013 we would point you back to our guidance.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much. So, two questions. The first is when you think about the dynamics on DIY versus the Pro in terms of the impact to your second half comp and then into \u201824, how are you thinking about DIY in terms of recovery? I think it\u2019s pretty clear where you stand on the backlog with the Pro. But I think DIY is a big question in terms of how that customer will feel and is going to feel in the second half.\nRichard McPhail: But it\u2019s \u2013 I think at the end of the day, it\u2019s all the same demand. And whether the Pro is fulfilling that demand or not, it\u2019s sort of all the same. So, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I actually would view it as saying we feel good about where our Pro business is. We feel good about the entirety of it, really. We don\u2019t know where those trends will go. But again, we know our Pros say their backlogs are healthy.\nKaren Short: And then the second question is \u2013 oh\u2026\nTed Decker: No, I was just going to say that the consumer \u2013 the nearest term view of consumer is the engagement in seasonal is led by the consumer, certainly, the garden business, but also things like exterior painting and stain. And when the weather improved, consumer responded. And it was really steady constructive demand. So, what we expect going forward, I think you look at all those macro comments we mentioned earlier that our consumer is a homeowner, 80%-odd of them on their homes, up tremendous equity value in that home, great jobs, great income, and it\u2019s a very healthy consumer segment in the overall economy. So, seeing their engagement in Q2 as weather improved, seeing their engagement in something like Halloween, I mean it\u2019s not an enormous business for us. But to say unbelievable engagement, Billy, in that product category, which is 100% discretionary, is a pretty decent telltale of engagement in the sector.\nKaren Short: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then my second question is, Richard, you always discussed your ability to flex SG&A with respect to labor, but then also inventory rapidly based on the comp in order to maintain stability with operating margins. So, I guess my question is, with the recent wage investments, do you still have the same flexibility within the same timeline in general to \u2013 with that rule of thumb in mind?\nRichard McPhail: Absolutely. I mean you would say that the jumping-off point would be post-wage investment. But post-wage investment, we have the same degree of flexibility we all \u2013 we have always had.\nKaren Short: Okay. Thanks very much.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning everyone. So, just two quick follow-ups. The first on ticket, curious if you could expand on DIY ticket versus Pro ticket trends as we think about sort of second half complexion. And then maybe if you could just speak to what the full year comp implies in terms of ticket, if it\u2019s still positive as you see it today?\nRichard McPhail: We have \u2013 I will answer the second part first, and then I will turn it to Billy. Again, we have got 24 weeks to go. We are not going to break out ticket and transaction within our guidance, other than just to repeat, we are encouraged by what we have seen with respect to settling of ticket and recovery in transactions. Billy?\nBilly Bastek: Yes. And as we called out just on the lumber piece alone, we will see that abate as we get to the back half of the year, and there will be much less of an impact than we saw in the first half overall.\nSteven Forbes: And then just lastly, as we think about the Dallas market, the 350 basis points you guys noted as of 2022 at the Analyst Day presentation, any update on how that market is trending year-to-date 2023 versus the company average?\nHector Padilla: Yes. No, Steve, this is Hector, again. We continue to be very encouraged by the results in Dallas, and we have scaled a lot of the capabilities that we first implemented in Dallas to all the markets. And we are seeing very similar and encouraging results as we see the customers engage, not just with the delivery sales, but also again, back in our stores and through our online digital platform. So, continue to be very encouraged about the performance. For us, Dallas has been a success so far. And we will continue to deploy capabilities to round out the ecosystem in Dallas and again in other markets as we test and learn and deploy capabilities at scale.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Janci for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and thank you for joining us today everyone. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call in November.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine and good morning everyone. Welcome to Home Depot\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President and CEO; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; Ann-Marie Campbell, Executive Vice President of U.S. Stores and International Operations; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thank you, Isabel and good morning everyone. Over the past 3 years, we grew our business $47 billion or 43%. After this period of unprecedented growth, we expect the demand would moderate in fiscal 2023, which our first quarter results reflect. Sales for the first quarter were $37.3 billion, down 4.2% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 4.5% from the same period last year and our U.S. stores had negative comps of 4.6%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.82 in the first quarter compared to $4.09 in the first quarter last year. Our sales for the quarter were below our expectations, primarily driven by lumber deflation and unfavorable weather. Particularly in our Western division as extreme weather events in California disproportionately impacted our results. As you will hear from Billy, where weather was favorable, we saw strength in key spring-related categories such as live goods and other garden-related categories. As we look beyond weather and lumber deflation, our underlying performance in the quarter was mixed. We saw more pressure across the business compared to what we observed when we reported fourth quarter results a few months ago. While there was relative strength in project-related categories like building materials, plumbing and hardware we had many departments with negative comps in the quarter and continue to see pressure in a number of big ticket discretionary categories. DIY customers outperformed the Pro in the quarter, but both were negative. While internal and external surveys suggest that Pro backlogs are still healthy and elevated relative to historical norms, they are lower than they were a year ago. Additionally, recent external data points suggest that the types of projects in these backlogs are changing from large scale models to smaller projects. Though we are only one quarter into the year, we believe the underperformance this quarter relative to our expectations, lumber deflation and continued uncertainty around underlying demand, warrants a more cautious sales outlook for the remainder of the year. Richard will take you through the details in a moment, but we are now guiding to a comp sales decline between 2% and 5%. Reflecting this updated comp guidance, we now expect our operating margin rate to be between 14.3% and 14% and earnings per share to decline between 7% and 13%. We continue to navigate the unique environment. We remain agile and respond to evolving customer dynamics while always being an advocate for value. In addition, we feel confident that the investments we have made in wage are driving the intended results. As Ann will discuss, in the short timeframe since our most recent wage enhancements took effect, we are attracting a greater number of qualified applicants and attrition is down. Lastly and as you would expect, we will continue to focus on driving productivity and efficiency across the business. While the near-term environment is uncertain, we remain bullish on the medium to long-term outlook for home improvement and our ability to grow share in this large and fragmented market. We look forward to sharing our perspective on the many opportunities ahead when we meet at our Investor and Analyst Conference coming up on June 13. Our team continues to focus on what is most important, our associates and customers. Our merchants, store met teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter. I\u2019d like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. I\u2019d also like to introduce Billy Bastek, who is recently named EVP of Merchandising. Billy is a 33-year veteran of the Home Depot and brings tremendous experience to the role, having spent his entire career with us in various roles of increasing responsibility throughout the merchandising organization. Not only is Billy a world class merchant leader, he is also a fantastic steward of our culture. And it\u2019s my pleasure to welcome him to the call today.\nBilly Bastek: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the first quarter, our sales were below our expectations, primarily driven by lumber deflation and unfavorable weather. We also saw a continuation of the trend we observed in the fourth quarter with consumers pulling back on big ticket and some discretionary type purchases. However, where weather was favorable, we saw strength in smaller ticket outdoor projects. Turning to our department comp performance for the first quarter, 4 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps, which are building materials, hardware, plumbing and millwork. During the first quarter, our comp average ticket increased 0.2% and comp transactions decreased 5%. Excluding core commodities comp average ticket was primarily impacted by inflation across several product categories as well as the demand for new and innovative products. Deflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 335 basis points during the first quarter driven primarily by deflation in lumber. During the first quarter, we saw a significant decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago. As an example, on average, framing lumber was approximately $420 per thousand board feet compared to approximately $1,170 in the first quarter of 2022, which is a decrease of 64%. Turning to total company online sales. Sales leveraging our digital platforms decreased approximately 2.9% compared to the first quarter of last year. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the first quarter, over 45% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores. DIY customers outperformed the Pro in the quarter, but both were negative. Pro results experienced a disproportionate impact as a result of lumber deflation and a wet start spring \u2013 wet start to spring negatively impacted both customer cohorts. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were down 6.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. We saw some big ticket strength across Pro-heavy categories like portable power, gypsum and pipe and fittings. After a couple of years of unprecedented demand in the home improvement market, we continue to see softness in big-ticket discretionary categories like patio, grills and appliances that likely reflects deferral of these single item purchases and pull forward. In addition, we\u2019ve seen demand soften across other parts of the business, including flooring, kitchen and bath. This softer demand may reflect consumers moving away from larger to smaller projects. And while there are factors impacting the home improvement market, our merchandising organization will continue to focus on being our customers\u2019 advocate for value. This means continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in stock and available for our customers when they need it. We will also continue to lean into products that simplify the project, saving our customers time and money. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about the innovation we\u2019re bringing to the market, whether it\u2019s Leviton\u2019s Decora Edge, Viega Copper press fittings or the launch of Behr Dynasty exterior paint, just to name a few. At our upcoming investor conference, I look forward to sharing more about these products and some of my favorite product innovations with you in person. It\u2019s the power of our vendor relationships, coupled with our best-in-class merchant organization that allows us to offer our customers the best brands with the most innovation to solve pain points, increase functionality or enhance performance at the best value in the market. Now let\u2019s turn our attention to spring. While we\u2019ve had a slower start to the season, we continue to be excited about the lineup of products we have for our customers and remain ready to help them with their outdoor projects or outdoor living needs. As you\u2019ve heard us say many times, we have a great lineup of outdoor power products and our assortment of RYOBI, Milwaukee, DEWALT and Makita offers something for everyone building on an ecosystem of innovative tools powered by the same battery platforms, and our live goods look incredible. We\u2019re ready for spring with everything from shrubs to a variety of flowers, herbs, vegetables for every type of gardener. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ann.\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Thanks, Billy, and good morning, everyone. We believe that in order to provide the best customer experience, we must focus on cultivating the best associate experience in retail. Last quarter, I spoke about the investments we have made to make it easier for associates to succeed at the Home Depot. We also announced that we would be investing approximately $1 billion in annualized compensation for frontline hourly associates. Today, I want to update you on key areas of improvement that we\u2019ve seen thus far. Our ability to attract qualified pools of candidates and hire from the top tier of these pools has improved even in our higher-volume stores. And in March, we saw the greatest year-over-year improvement in our attrition rates across all associate tenure cohorts that we have seen in some time. As a result, we are seeing improvements in key customer service metrics as well as benefits to our operations in the form of consistent staffing and less safety incidents across all our regions. These improvements are exactly what we set out to achieve with this wage investment. The consistency and talent of our workforce is an important foundation for driving both customer service and productivity. It also gives us the ability and confidence to accelerate other key initiatives that are yielding positive results with respect to customer service and productivity. We have implemented changes to our order fulfillment processes to drive speed and efficiency when picking and staging orders for customers. Historically, we have allocated fulfillment hours based on overall order volume. Now we have transitioned to allocating hours more accurately based on the types of products being picked. Just for example, it takes us less time to pick and stage [indiscernible] versus a patio set. We are also grouping fulfillment orders in batches so that associates can pick multiple orders at one time. We also continue to focus on simplification. We\u2019ve talked about leveraging the Sidekick application to help associates prioritize the highest value task more effectively. Powered by our machine learning logic, Sidekick direct associates to key bays where on-shelf availability is low or out exist. Since Sidekick was rolled out last year, we have seen improvement in our on-shelf availability for all SKUs, but we have seen the most improvement in our high-velocity SKUs or the products that are key drivers of our business. This has translated to an increase of approximately 300 basis points in our self availability customer service scores. While this app is helping us to be more efficient with our task in activity and improving our customer experience in the process, Sidekick is just getting started. These initiatives are just a few examples of the many different types of projects that can drive significant impacts for customers, our associates and our shareholders. I am so excited about all that our store teams are dealing to focus on both the customer and associate experience and look forward to sharing a lot more in a few weeks. None of this would be possible without our amazing associates, and I want to thank them all for what they do every day to take care of our customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, total sales were $37.3 billion a decrease of approximately $1.7 billion or 4.2% from last year. During the first quarter, our total company comps were negative 4.5% with comps of negative 2.5% in February, negative 7.5% in March and negative 3.7% in April. Comps in the U.S. were negative 4.6% for the quarter with comps of negative 2.8% in February, negative 7.5% in March and negative 3.7% in April. Our first quarter comp sales missed our own expectations, particularly in the months of March and April, driven primarily by 2 notable factors. First, lumber deflation drove a negative comp impact of approximately 220 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022. Second, unfavorable weather, particularly in our Western division further impacted our results. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 33.7% a decrease of 8 basis points from the first quarter last year, primarily driven by increased pressure from shrink. We continue to successfully offset supply chain and product cost pressures while maintaining our position as the customer\u2019s advocate for value. During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 25 basis points to 18.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our operating expense performance during the first quarter reflects the planned compensation increases announced during our fourth quarter 2022 call as well as a onetime benefit from a legal settlement. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 14.9% compared to 15.2% in the first quarter of 2022. Interest and other expense for the first quarter increased by $72 million to $441 million due primarily to interest on our floating rate debt as well as higher debt balances than a year ago. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.2%, up from 23.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter or $3.82, a decrease of 6.6% compared to the first quarter of 2022. During the first quarter, we opened 2 new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,324. Retail selling square footage was approximately 241 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $25.4 billion, essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2022 and inventory turns were 3.9x down from 4.4x last year. Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. During the first quarter, we invested approximately $900 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 43.6%, down from 45.3% and in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Now I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2023. As you may recall, last quarter, we provided flat sales and comp guidance for fiscal 2023. As we mentioned last quarter, our guidance did not include potential impacts from lumber deflation, which we noted could negatively impact our performance for the quarter and the year. As a result, lumber negatively impacted comps by approximately 220 basis points in the first quarter. Given the negative impact of the first quarter sales from lumber and weather, further softening of demand relative to our expectations and continued uncertainty regarding consumer demand patterns, we are updating our guidance to reflect a range of potential outcomes. We now expect fiscal 2023 sales and comp sales to decline between 2% and 5%. As a result of the change in our sales outlook, we are now targeting an operating margin between 14.3% and 14.0% for the year. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion, and we are anticipating between a 7% and 13% decline in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2022. As Ted mentioned, we expected 2023 to be a year of moderation in the home improvement market, driven by monetary policy actions to dampen overall consumer demand. In our view, we are in a transitional period in the consumer economy. Setting the short-term impacts of monetary policy aside, we know that the home improvement customer is healthy and we believe the medium to long-term underlying fundamentals of home improvement make it one of the most attractive markets in retail and the economy as a whole. We believe that we are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers with a broad assortment of products, strong in-stock levels and knowledgeable associates. The investments we\u2019ve made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model. As we look forward, we will continue to prudently invest to strengthen our competitive position, leverage our scale and low-cost position to outperform our market and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I have two questions on the ticket side. Average ticket was flat in the first quarter. I think last year, you had same-SKU inflation ex commodity of the high single digits all year. So how much of the ticket deceleration relative to 1Q last year was just simply a same SKU disinflation on a year-over-year basis versus things like project size and trade down?\nTed Decker: Hi, Chris, good morning. We are still seeing inflation in same SKU items. So putting commodity aside that we \u2013 we gave the example of lumber being down 64%. We\u2019re still experiencing inflation in our ticket and our average unit retail. So the non-index or the non-commodity prices are still lapping cost in price from last year. And then there is still moderate inflation live this year in 2023. So inflation is still present in the average ticket.\nChris Horvers: So as you look ahead, and how are you thinking about how much of a headwind that becomes over the year? And what should you incorporate in the guidance? And then related to that, transactions are sort of back to \u201819 levels, but in the first quarter, tickets still up 37% versus the first quarter of \u201819. I\u2019m guessing maybe a third of that is same SKU. So just trying to put into context the risk around ticket in terms of disinflation and then also project size and trade down?\nTed Decker: Right. Well, it\u2019s something we clearly look at carefully. There certainly has been a lot of cumulative inflation in price in our average unit retail in our ticket but that is not something that we are expecting to broadly deflate. Now commodity prices those price essentially weekly, and we will price those up or down on a weekly basis. But price levels in a number of our products have increased and been established over the past 3 years and embedded in that higher ticket is innovation. So when you think of ticket, a lot of that is not just cost and price, it\u2019s trading up to better product. When you think of battery-powered outdoor power equipment, what we\u2019ve done in the paint department with better and better paints there is innovation and with innovation, it\u2019s usually higher price points. So we don\u2019t see those deflating broadly as we work through this period of moderation.\nChris Horvers: I guess just in terms of \u2013 do you think \u2013 if you sort of look at the trend on project size, does that become \u2013 will that cause ticket to become negative over the years? Is that how you\u2019re thinking about it?\nTed Decker: I wouldn\u2019t say over the years, certainly, right now, we are seeing two of the biggest factors on each of ticket and transaction is, as we said. We have specific discretionary items, best examples are things like a grill, a patio set, an appliance, those tend to be one-off discretionary items, and we are seeing pressure on those. We\u2019ve been seeing pressure in those for some time. What was newer in our observations this quarter is that while projects are still strong and Pro project backlog is still elevated the size of the projects are getting a bit smaller. And it could be that the project is being deferred or it could be that the project is being broken up into chunks. So whether \u2013 rather than do an entire room or an entire basement, you start working the way at it in smaller chunks. And that clearly impacts items per basket in overall activity.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Zaccone: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could comment a bit on what you\u2019re seeing in the second quarter to date, just given the fact that weather has been so volatile across the U.S. And then just in the context of that, how should we think about second quarter maybe versus the back half of the year? What can kind of get you to the high end versus the low end of your full year guidance range?\nRichard McPhail: Sure. Well, thank you. Thanks, Steven. So the first 2 weeks of May are in-line with the guidance we\u2019ve provided. We don\u2019t break out quarterly guidance, but the 2 \u2013 the first 2 weeks are consistent with the guidance we provided. We\u2019re going to learn a lot over the next few weeks with respect to underlying demand as we still have some of our largest selling weeks ahead of us. If you think about what our guide implies from a shape of the year, first, let\u2019s perhaps talk about the building blocks of our range. So how we got to the negative 2, the negative 5, and then we will talk about the shape of the year. The negative 2 was really built on flowing through the Q1 performance, adding the Q1 lumber impacting the guidance, adding a little further lumber pressure that we will see in Q2. We think that there could be 120 basis points of comp pressure in Q2 based on current lumber price. And then that negative 2 scenario also reflects our share of PCE, which shifted at a more accelerated rate than expected in the first quarter sort of holding at that rate for the rest of the year. So those are the underlying assumptions in the negative 2 is. The negative 5 case simply takes that PCE share shift assumption, our share of PCE and assumes that we revert back to 2019 levels of PCE share by the end of the fiscal year. So that would imply the negative 5% case. When we talk about the shape of the year for the negative 2 high end of the range, we would expect that the second half would be better than the first half, really due to lumber normalization in the second half on a year-over-year basis. The vast majority of lumber pressure year-over-year exists in that first half. So as that normalizes in the negative 2 case, second half improves versus the first half. In the lower end of our range, we would expect the first half would outperform the second half, again, due to that assumption of continued acceleration in our share of PCE.\nSteven Zaccone: Great. Thanks for all the details on that. And then I wanted to follow-up on the comment about this being a transitional period for the consumer. In the context of the question is how do you think about this year as a potential trough in demand for home improvement versus it potentially being a multiyear trend and maybe 2024 is another step down. And I know you\u2019ll have a \u2013 there is a lot of moving pieces, and you\u2019ll have an Analyst Day in a month. But if you could comment on that at all would be helpful.\nTed Decker: Yes. Why don\u2019t I just take it up a bit on the consumer and their health and then their engagement in home improvement. If you look at the consumer overall, they are still relatively strong as evidenced by continued increases in personal consumption. And then when you look at our customer, I mean, we have one of the best customer sets in any market sector. Our customer is stronger than the overall consumer and you think they tend to have good jobs, increasing wages and own their homes and collectively, those home values have increased by about $15 trillion since 2019. So as we said, we grew disproportionately these past few years, $47 billion in growth, 43% cumulative comp. As consumers shifted their spending, as these healthier consumers shifted their spending into home improvement. And undoubtedly, after that period of growth, you\u2019re going to see moderation which is exactly what we saw in Q1. So when you think about what this reflects about the consumer and the future engagement in home improvement, we think about a few things, we\u2019ve seen an accelerated shift out of goods to service spending as the broader economy has gotten back to normal and that\u2019s, in particular, in home improvement, obviously, people aren\u2019t spending all their time at home as they did in the prior few years. And then there is an impact of pull forward or deferral of certain categories, like I spoke about earlier, appliances, patio grills that saw outsized growth in the early years of the pandemic. And then a newer dynamic now that we\u2019re really seeing, again, is just this past quarter is a more cautious consumer, given the broader macro concerns, including credit availability. And that aligns with what we\u2019re observing in our business and the comments I made about our Pros and consumers taking on smaller, less discretionary projects. And then lastly, with the buildup of inflation that we\u2019ve seen, there is certainly some price sensitivity, particularly with respect to those bigger ticket discretionary items. So in general, our homeowner consumer is \u2013 remains very healthy. It\u2019s a matter of digesting the outsized growth and shift those consumption spend out of services in the goods and particularly into home improvement. So we will get through this period. Richard\u2019s talked about the PCE normalization. We don\u2019t know where that ends or how quickly it goes. There is an argument that PCE and home improvement stays elevated. All the reasons we\u2019ve talked about before, the home values are so much higher. The age of the home is considerably older on average. People are spending more time at home. So all those dynamics could suggest normalization might be, in fact, a higher level of PCE spending in our sector. But regardless of all that, we will get through this transition period and we remain incredibly bullish on the health of this sector. It\u2019s one of the absolute best sectors in all of retail. It\u2019s a large and fragmented market, and we have tremendous growth opportunities going forward.\nSteven Zaccone: Thanks for all the detail. Best of luck for the remainder of spring.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. \nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. Can you help us bridge the gap from the 15.3% EBIT margin last year to the 14% to 14.3% today? And specifically, how should we think about the moving parts around gross margin versus SG&A? And then specifically for Q1, cost controls were a bit better than expected. Can you talk us through the impact of the legal settlement? And anything else you\u2019d highlight there?\nRichard McPhail: Yes, Zach. Thanks for the question. So let\u2019s first walk from 15.3%, which is our actual operating margin in 2022 to our original guide of 14.5% margin. At a flat comp, particularly in an inflationary environment, our business will see a degree of deleverage in expenses. And so there are really three factors. Natural deleverage in the business, a $1 billion investment in wage, which has proven to, as Ann said, provide real benefit from a customer experience point of view. And then productivity initiatives designed to offset some of that deleverage. And so when you net all those three against each other, that led to our guide of 14.5% at a flat comp. As we reflect on the revision to guidance, the range of operating margin that we have guided toward reflects the natural operating margin at these negative comp levels. In other words, there is \u2013 there are levers that help blunt de-leverage, but there is de-leverage still in our model. The greatest mitigator is that we have an activity-based payroll model. And so as activity in our stores decreases, so does our lever \u2013 sorry, our level of payroll. So you do have a natural buffer there. Began, the 14.3% to the 14.0% would be the natural operating margin at the negative 2 and the negative 5. When we think about the one-time legal settlement, so we did realize a large one-time benefit from a legal settlement our guidance assumes this benefit will be offset during the remainder of the year. And so that\u2019s just a simplified assumption. We will protect that 14% operating margin, we\u2019d agree with \u2013 operate with a degree of financial flexibility. And as the year progresses, we will be evaluating the levers available to us against the backdrop of the environment.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Appreciate the color. I\u2019ve got a big picture question. Could you talk about the macro and housing indicators that you believe are now most correlated to your business today? And then considering the golden handcuffs of sub-3% mortgages out there, do you think this takes longer now for housing turnover to materially recover.\nRichard McPhail: Well, I\u2019ll take the second one first. We\u2019ve already seen the impact to housing turnover. I think that we\u2019ve probably fully seen the impact of higher mortgage rates on potential sellers. In this environment, if you have a low fixed rate mortgage, and let\u2019s just remind ourselves, 40% of owner-occupied homes are owned outright. And of the households that hold the mortgage, close to 90% of those hold fixed rate mortgages under 5%. So with mortgage rates where they are today, there is a reluctance to sell your home, and there is a greater incentive to stay in place and improve in place. And as Ted said, you\u2019re spending more time at home and that home is getting older. And you do not have an incentive to sell and take on a higher rate mortgage. So I think we\u2019ve already seen that in housing turnover. With respect to macro indicators, I think as Ted said, I think what we\u2019re seeing in the business now is reflective of the broader impact of tighter monetary policy and tighter credit conditions. It\u2019s interesting as we saw the quarter unfold. If you look at how we did during February, our business was actually trending quite positively. In fact, February\u2019s dollar run rate adjusted for normal seasonal curves would have implied a positive comp for the year. You think about March, well, first of all, March was impacted by extreme weather most notably in California. And that was also the point where we saw accelerating share shift. There were some external factors there that maybe don\u2019t have direct influence, but as you know, in March, we saw the collapse of SVB. And you think about the tighter credit conditions that were a result of the external environment, we think all of those just build to a broader \u2013 a broader caution among consumers. As Ted said, our homeowner customer is extremely healthy, very healthy balance sheet, healthy income. This is a broader consumer economy dynamic we think we\u2019re seeing.\nZach Fadem: Thanks, Richard. I appreciate all the color.\nRichard McPhail: Thanks, Zach.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. As you look across your entire assortment and trying and assess current unit demand versus what would be a normalized rate. How many product categories are still well above what would be suggested by a normalized rate, perhaps if you look at appliances, grills and patio furniture and where units are today versus 2019 and extend that math to the rest of the business what would that suggest about a downside comp scenario even from here?\nTed Decker: Michael, great question, I wouldn\u2019t say we have gone into that level of detail by category. Certainly, a number of those categories were elevated. The ones you called out, patio grills, appliances were elevated on retails with innovation, as well as units with outsized demand. I think when you think of normal replacement cycles and pull forward on some of that product, that\u2019s just going to take a little bit of time to normalize. Other categories that we haven\u2019t talked so much about that are \u2013 that are really booming frankly, are categories like building materials where we are seeing unit volume still running quite strong. We see units in lumber picking up meaningfully and as prices come down and you get attachment with building materials. And then hardware, which attaches to both building materials in lumber, we are seeing our strongest hardware unit productivity and attach rate to those project starter categories, I think Billy, it\u2019s the highest attach rate we have ever recorded.\nBilly Bastek: Yes, that\u2019s right. If you think about our building materials performance, we called that out as outperform, along with lumber, still seeing great unit productivity across those businesses and seeing the attach smaller, certainly smaller projects taking place. And then Ted did mention some of the \u2013 we did see some pull forward in some of those businesses that we talked about initially as well.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is, if we consider 2023 to be the transition year and comps for The Home Depot do return to growth in 2024, would you start seeing leverage on your expenses on the first dollar of growth, or will there be some catch-up like Richard, you mentioned legal expense, you expect to give back of that over the course of this year? Presumably, there will be an incentive comp benefit as you lowered your guidance. So, will you see some of those items come back next year such that if we have in our models a positive comp, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect you to leverage your expenses on the first dollar growth next year?\nRichard McPhail: Well, we will get into a bit more detail on outlook in 2024 when we get together in June for the investor conference. We are not modeling 2024 at that level of specificity as we are only a few months into 2023. But broadly, Michael, our model is meant to leverage and will leverage with volume. And we have some costs to take out of the business. For sure, if you think on the product side, with transportation in particular, you will see significant costs come out as we work through our current inventory levels with the higher transportation rates experienced during COVID. And then on the operating model, the store and labor, that will always leverage with growth.\nTed Decker: And obviously, we manage cost and price independently, Michael, and transportation costs are a market dynamic. And so we will make sure that we are positioned as the customer\u2019s advocate for value with respect to price. But as Ted said, we will get more into this in 2023 \u2013 sorry, in June, June 13th.\nMichael Lasser: Richard, Can I just clarify what that comment is intended to stay, because one of the debates is costs have come down, whether transportation costs certain raw materials, so there is a question of whether that means there is going to be like-for-like product deflation in non-commodity related areas over the course of this year. And it sounds like Home Depot is going to continue to be an advocate for growth, but how would you clarify that, or advocate for value, sorry?\nRichard McPhail: Right. No, again, we manage cost and price independently. As Ted said, we don\u2019t expect broad-based deflation in this market.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning.\nTed Decker: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel: My first question, I know we have discussed a bit already, but the weather. I was just wondering if you can go in a little more detail what you saw kind of the spread between \u2013 in comps between markets where weather was an issue and markets where weather may have been more than normal? And then as \u2013 look, I am looking at our data, the spring has come, has arrived, and in a lot of markets. So, what are you seeing then as far as any type of pickup in seasonal categories as the spring light conditions are starting to take hold?\nTed Decker: Yes. Brian, thank you. So, weather as we have said, was most pronounced in the West in a very unique weather pattern. This wasn\u2019t a bad weekend. This was record rain and even things like snow in Southern California. So, where weather was sustained and bad when we look at the West versus our Northern and Southern divisions, the impact was a multiple of what we saw in the other parts of the country. And generally, we have talked in the past about the bathtub effect, and we wouldn\u2019t have updated guidance base on stronger relatively weaker sales in Q1 based on weather because we would look to get that back. So, when you think of a shorter spring season in the North where people are going to get that activity done in a limited number of weeks. If you don\u2019t get it done in the first quarter, people tend to make it up in the second quarter. The dynamic in the West, this went into our guidance of the minus 2 to minus 5, is the West, it\u2019s more level weather patterns. We have very large stores, very high Pro-concentration. And when you get bad weather, you are not really looking at a bathtub effect to make it up in a short season. You just sort of missed that selling week. So, the difference geographically was pronounced in the West, and we just look at that as sort of lost selling weeks. In the north, the behavior is more typical to the bathtub. I mean we didn\u2019t have many good weekends but when we did sales were incredibly strong. So, we are certainly hoping for better weather in Q2.\nBrian Nagel: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then \u2013 very helpful and my second question, again, recognized there is lots of moving parts here. And you are dealing with varied comparisons through the year. But as you look at \u2013 as you think about or as you \u2013 the updated guidance for \u201823 you gave us today, does that basically assume kind of a continuation of what we have seen so far in \u201823, or are you assuming some type of either improvement further deterioration, etcetera, through the year?\nRichard McPhail: That\u2019s right, Brian. That\u2019s why we gave the range. I mean you would say that particularly at the bottom end of the range would assume greater deceleration than we have observed to-date. And it\u2019s consistent with the hypothetical case we laid out at the beginning of the year which was to say, look, if our share of PCE reverts to 2019 levels by the end of the year, that is what you would see. And again, that would be an accelerated rate of reversion versus what we have seen. So, the negative 2, again, sort of has \u2013 it takes into account the fact that we saw a sharper reversion than expected in Q1 and that we would hold that share through the end of the year. It\u2019s not a perfect science, and that\u2019s why we gave you a range.\nBrian Nagel: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nTed Decker: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning guys. So, Richard, you talked about protecting a 14% operating margin even with the wage investments that you guys have made this year at this point. What other \u2013 I mean, how much flexibility do you think you have on the SG&A line, because I know labor is your biggest kind of plus bucket, but you are actually investing more in labor, not less. So, like how should we think about how you guys are managing that component?\nRichard McPhail: Well, the investment in wage, again, which has really proven to have driven a lot of benefit on the customer experience side, that\u2019s embedded in our guidance. We have made the investment and that will be roughly a $1 billion addition to our cost structure, but it\u2019s embedded in our margin structure. Again, as the year progresses, we will be evaluating levers available to us against the backdrop of the environment. We invest to win over the long-term. We are comfortable with our level of investment as it stands today. We will continue to assess our investments against the backdrop of the environment, and we have some flexibility there, too.\nScot Ciccarelli: And just a quick follow-up, with higher interest rates in the marketplace, does that change how you guys are thinking about capital allocation, not necessarily from a strategic basis, but how aggressive you want to be in terms of issuing debt to buy back stock? Thanks.\nRichard McPhail: We feel good about where we stand from a debt-to-EBITDA perspective. We had a maturity, a $1 billion maturity in April and we repaid that, didn\u2019t refinance it. We have no need necessarily to go to the debt capital markets in the short-term, and we will watch market conditions as they unfold.\nTed Decker: But we feel good about where we are from a leverage perspective.\nScot Ciccarelli: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Thomas: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about the trends that you are seeing in the Pro business. I think this is the first time in a few quarters that it had underperformed DIY. What are you seeing out of the Pro? Has it improved? Has the weather has gotten better? And how are you thinking about it going forward?\nTed Decker: Yes. I will let Hector talk a bit about the Pro and what we like that we are seeing. But from the broadest perspective, don\u2019t forget the Pro was disproportionately impacted by lumber and then, again a very strong Pro business out West. But we like what we are seeing with our customers as they engage with our capabilities.\nHector Padilla: Yes. Good morning Brad, this is Hector. On a 2-year basis, our performance was positive and as Ted just mentioned and Billy, we saw that disproportionate impact from lumber and weather. What we are most excited about is what we are seeing with our Pros. We are engaging with our new supply chain assets and expanded Pro capabilities that we have talked about in the past. We are gaining share wallet with them and as they are growing their spend with us, they have a willingness to consolidate their purchases with Home Depot. They love our brand, they love our assortment and our value proposition, and we are seeing that across many markets. I really look forward to speaking with you in more detail in June about how the Pro business is doing and around the capabilities that we are building.\nBrad Thomas: Great. And as a quick follow-up, obviously, some moving pieces here with weather and deflation. I believe your prior outlook for the home improvement market was a decline of low-single digits. What are you assuming in your new outlook?\nRichard McPhail: So, we began the year with a flat outlook for PCE. There are economists who have lifted that outlook slightly for PCE. But as we observe PCE share that our market holds and the shifts that we have seen, we expect our market to be down mid to high-single digits. And so implicit in our guide is the expectation that we will continue to take share.\nBrad Thomas: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I want to ask about home prices. There has been a case that\u2019s made that demands decoupled a bit from turnover and that prices could matter more. I want to ask specifically about how that could inform the cadence of the year, because if you are restrict adherent to prices, the lag effect could suggest that the back half core gets a little bit worse. I am just curious how you think about that?\nTed Decker: Well, if all the housing metrics, Simeon, we think home value has the tightest correlation to home improvement spend, certainly, turnover and household formation also are influence to spend. And there is generally a lag effect, as you say, to home price appreciation or depreciation. I think the difference here is how sensitive are people going to be that I was up 45% in home value from the end of 2019. And yes, now month-over-month, the values are off slightly, but I am still up 40% or 38% from where I was at the end of 2019. That psychology is tough to weed out with the general consumer apprehension given general inflation in macro and rising interest rates and all the talk, are we going to have a recession, are we not going to have a recession. So, I wouldn\u2019t think that, that would have that big of an impact. We are not thinking that\u2019s a big impact in 2H.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. That\u2019s fair. One more question around the updated guide for Richard. The midpoint of this negative 2% to negative 5%, just to clarify, that assumes that the core worsens from Q1 as well as the impact of lumber worsens from Q1?\nRichard McPhail: You can think of the impact of lumber being kind of an assumption that is equal across all cases. So, about 120 basis points of pressure to Q2 and then very, very slight, really non-meaningful pressure in the second half. And again, we have given a range, Simeon, to just provide sort of a balanced view here. It\u2019s tough to extrapolate this early in the year. And so we feel like the range approach is the most helpful guidance that we can give.\nSimeon Gutman: Right. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Sigman: Hey everybody. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on that assumption that home improvement wallet share will normalize back to 2019 levels. And obviously, that implies things get worse from here. But I guess there has also been some prior cycles where wallet share overshoots on the downside and goes lower than where it was before, and we talked a lot about pull forward already today. But how do you think about that scenario and why that scenario would be wrong this time?\nTed Decker: Well, as we have said, we have given the guide for our best view of 2023 in the downside of a minus 5% would be that you have4 reverted by the end of the year to 2019 levels. So, mathematically, you could say, well, there would be some hangover of that into 2024. And then your question does it overshoot, frankly we don\u2019t know. As I have said earlier, there is as strong in case, if not stronger, that where you settle is a higher share. If based nothing more than your asset class is so much higher. I mean we are not talking billions of dollars. We are literally talking trillions of dollars that this asset class has more value. So, if you are thinking about percent of investment in any asset class, you have got a much bigger base. We talk about the average age of the home is now over 40-years-old, and we have big chunks of homes that are reaching that 20-year and 40-year sort of witching hour of age. We all know we are spending more time at home, so wear and tear is higher. So, we have talked about all these dynamics in the past and I would say if you had to call it, you would say, the spend would ultimately settle out potentially higher.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Fair enough. Just one follow-up on the EBIT margin guidance for this year, I think what you laid out here at the low end, so 14% margin on negative mid-single digit comps very consistent with the scenarios you talked about last quarter, but it does include that Q1 SG&A benefit. Can you just help us better understand, does that imply the underlying is actually lower? I think you may have said there is an offset to that. Maybe you can just clarify that point. Thank you.\nTed Decker: Thanks for the question. To clarify, it\u2019s not assuming that the underlying would be lower. Our guide actually assumes that, that gain would be offset through the remainder of the year.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Thanks very much.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on lumber work trends. You made a comment about price deflation. Curious if you could talk about what specifically happened with unit volume during the quarter. And then what the guidance assumes in the back half as the price compares ease in terms of unit expectations, right, in the second half?\nBilly Bastek: Yes. Thanks Steven. This is Billy. As we talked about, Richard mentioned in his previous comments, we do anticipate the greatest pressure from lumber in the first half. For the total year, we think lumber deflation impact to the comp is about 100 basis points. Now with that, we are seeing strong unit movement across plywood, dimensional lumber, PT decking, it\u2019s 220 basis points, as we mentioned in Q1, another 120 basis points roughly in Q2, which is in the guide. And then we don\u2019t expect a material impact from lumber for the back half of the year, but still seeing really strong unit performance in that categories I called out.\nSteven Forbes: And so maybe just \u2013 so you do expect unit volume to improve in the back half, or what is sort of the trajectory of unit dynamics, right, with lumber specifically implied in the guide?\nBilly Bastek: Well, as the pricing normalizes year-over-year, you will see the units reflect in that as we get towards a more rational state that we had in the back half of last year.\nSteven Forbes: And then just a quick follow-up, any sort of preview of what we should expect at the upcoming Analyst Day? I think you made a comment before potentially about speaking to 2024, but I wasn\u2019t sure if you can maybe clarify any sort of previewed thoughts on what we should expect to hear at the Analyst Day?\nIsabel Janci: Thanks for that question, Steve. I think what you will hear us talk about is the updated TAM that we will lay out for you, our growth opportunities to go after that TAM and a little bit more about why we are so excited about the sector and the business.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nIsabel Janci: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thanks Christine and thanks everybody for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you at our Investor Conference on June 13th.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot\u2019s third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today\u2019s press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share. For a reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release and our website. Now, let me turn the call over to, Ted.\nTed Decker: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $40.2 billion an increase of 6.6% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 1.3% from the same period last year and our U.S. stores had negative comps of 1.2%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.78 in the third quarter compared to $3.85 in the third quarter last year. From a geographical perspective, storms and more favorable weather throughout the quarter drove a higher degree of variability in the performance across our divisions and four of our 19 U.S. regions delivered positive comps. In local currency, Mexico and Canada posted comps above the company average, with Mexico posting positive comps in the quarter. In the third quarter, our associates and communities were impacted by two hurricanes. As you\u2019ll hear from Ann, our associates and supplier partners worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances to serve our customers and communities. Our thoughts continue to be with those impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton. Excluding the impacts from the hurricanes, our third quarter performance exceeded our expectations. As weather normalized, we saw better engagement across seasonal goods in certain outdoor projects. But as Billy will detail, we continue to see pressure on larger remodeling projects driven by the higher interest rate environment and continued macroeconomic uncertainty. Today, we updated our guidance primarily as a result of the better performance in the third quarter as well as expected hurricane related demand in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2024, we now expect our sales to grow approximately 4%, comps to decline approximately 2.5% and adjusted diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 1%. Richard will take you through the details in a moment. Despite the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, our focus remains on creating the best interconnected experience, growing Pro wallet share through a differentiated set of capabilities in building new stores. Today, I would like to highlight where we are improving the interconnected experience. Recall that over the last several years, we built a network of downstream supply chain facilities, including 19 direct fulfillment centers, allowing us to reach 90% of the U.S. population with same or next day delivery. Recently, we expanded our assortment in these facilities to allow for faster delivery speeds across more products. We made significant website enhancements to better communicate faster delivery options. Many customers were not aware of our robust delivery options. In the third quarter, we launched a marketing campaign that builds awareness of our faster delivery speeds. While this is just launched, we are seeing the intended results, greater customer engagement, higher conversion and incremental sales. This is also the first quarter that reflects a full period of SRS in our financials. SRS gives us the right to win with the specialty trade Pro customer who need specialized capabilities to complete their project. The SRS team did an exceptional job in the quarter and is on track to deliver $6.4 billion in sales for the approximately seven months we\u2019ll owe them in fiscal 2024. As you would expect, the immediate focus with SRS is supporting their growth both organically and through acquisitions. However, we are also seeing incremental cross-sale opportunities from our distinct product catalogs and competitive advantages. As you can tell, we remain excited about the growth opportunities in front of us. We are committed to investing in our capabilities to continue growing share in any environment. Our merchants, store and MET teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job executing throughout the quarter. I\u2019d like to thank them for their dedication and hard work. Before I turn the call over to, Ann, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reflect on the legacy of our Co-Founder, Bernie Marcus. We owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to Bernie. He was a master merchant and a retail visionary. But even more importantly, he valued our associates, customers and communities above all. He\u2019s left us with an invaluable legacy in the backbone of our company, our values and culture. The entire Home Depot family is deeply saddened by his passing. He will be missed. With that, let me turn the call over to, Ann.\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to extend my deepest sympathy and support to all the residents and communities that have been impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton. One of the hallmarks of The Home Depot has always been to support our communities through natural disasters and we are incredibly proud of the tireless efforts of our teams, pre and post the storms to stage and deliver the needed products while ensuring the safety of our associates. In the aftermath of the storms, the efforts of both our field and Store Support Center teams have been extraordinary and demonstrate the culture and exceptionalism of our amazing associates who are committed to providing the necessary support and resources to help rebuild and restore their communities. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all of our effective associates and communities as they navigate this challenging time. Over the last year, I\u2019ve provided some key insights on the progress we\u2019re making with our Pro Ecosystem capabilities that serve Pro working on larger complex projects. We are pleased with the performance of this Pro Ecosystem which is now in 17 U.S. markets. Today, I would like to take a moment to highlight some of the investments we\u2019re making in our stores to deliver the best experience for every pro buying occasion. You\u2019ve heard us talk about our focus on improving on shelf availability through multiple initiatives, but we are also enhancing leadership oversight, processes and systems to drive the overall in-store pro customer experience. We recently introduced a Pro Customer Experience Manager to help drive a higher level of connectivity with our in-store pro and outside sales team in order to deliver a more seamless experience and exceptional service. This new leadership role with our existing teams enables us to focus more on the needs of the [passion] (ph) pro with a focus on building relationships with our most important pros, ensuring we have job lot quantities available for sale on critical SKUs and allocated more labor hours to the pro desk during peak shopping times. We also continue to improve my view with more robust insights to drive a deeper level of engagement and more actionable outcomes for pro customers. These tools combined with the process improvements, leadership engagement and increased emphasis on service are driving more customer engagement and improving the in-store shopping experience for pro customers. I would also like to take a minute to share with you a bit more around the progress we have seen over the last few quarters as it relates to shrink. For us, our focus on mitigating shrink has been a continual and evolving process, leveraging our cross functional teams and investing in technology to test and learn the most effective methods of reducing shrink. While the external environment continues to be challenging, we\u2019re incredibly pleased with the positive momentum we are seeing and improve results through our shrink mitigating initiatives. I could not be more excited about the progress we are making across the business to drive a best-in-class experience for customers. Our stores are ready and our associates stay engaged and I would like to thank them for all that they do. Lastly, as one of the 100 of 1000 of Home Depot associates inspired by Bernie\u2019s passion for giving back to our associates and communities, I want to extend my deepest condolences to the entire Marcus family. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\nBilly Bastek: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, our performance during the third quarter exceeded our expectations as we saw better engagement in some seasonal leasing categories as a result of more favorable weather throughout the quarter. In addition, we also saw incremental sales as a result of the hurricanes. However, the higher interest rate environment and greater macroeconomic uncertainty continues to pressure overall project demand. Turning to our merchandising department comp performance for the third quarter, our power, outdoor garden, building materials, indoor garden and paint departments posted positive comps, while lumber, plumbing and hardware were all above the company average. During the third quarter, our comp transactions decreased 0.6% and comp average ticket decreased 0.8%. However, we continue to see our customers trading up for new and innovative products. Big ticket comp transactions or those over a $1,000 were down 6.8% compared to the third quarter of last year. We continue to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund the project, such as kitchen and bath remodels. During the third quarter, pro sales were positive and outpaced the DIY customer. And, those pros engaging with elements of our Pro Ecosystem, who also have a dedicated salesperson, were our strongest performing pros in the quarter. Turning to total company online sales. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased 4% compared to the third quarter of last year. And, for those customers that chose to transact with us online during the third quarter, nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores. In addition, as you heard from Ted, we are focused on continuing to improve our interconnected retail experience, whether it is our faster delivery speeds, our more relevant and personalized search results or our enhanced product review summaries powered by AI, all of which are leading to greater purchasing confidence for our customers. During the third quarter, we hosted our Annual Supplier Partnership Meeting, where we focused on how we will continue to work together to bring the best products to market, deliver innovative solutions that simplify the project and offer great value with best-in-class features and benefits. At the event, we recognized a number of vendors across categories who continue to transform the industry with the innovation they bring to our customers on a daily basis, this included Starlink, Milwaukee, RYOBI, WAGO, Glacier Bay, Henry Roofing and many more. We are proud of the innovation and partnership that our suppliers bring to The Home Depot and the value that we\u2019re able to offer both our Pro and DIY customers. We also hosted our Annual Labor Day and Halloween events and we\u2019re pleased with the results. During our Labor Day event, we were encouraged with the customers\u2019 engagement across a number of categories, including grills, which had positive comps for the quarter led by Traeger. And, 2024 was another record sales year for our Halloween program, both in-store and online as our customers continue to add to their collection with our unique and exclusive product assortment. As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we plan to maintain our momentum with our annual holiday, Black Friday and Gift Center events. In our Gift Center event, we continue to lean into brands that matter most for our customers with our assortment of Milwaukee, RYOBI, Makita, DEWALT, RIDGID, Husky and more. We\u2019ll have something for everyone, whether it\u2019s our wide assortment of cordless RYOBI tools, Milwaukee M18 FUEL Toolkits and our new Husky BITE Tools. We are bringing more innovation in batteries with RYOBI Edge, DEWALT XR and the expansion of the Milwaukee Forge lineup with new 8 and 12 amp hour batteries, all designed to bring more power to our customers. And, the innovative Husky BITE tool technology offers increased grip on new and rounded fasteners, better access, more torque and more leverage, making them a great addition to any toolbox at a great value. And, they are exclusive to The Home Depot. Our merchandising organization remains focused on being our customers\u2019 advocate for value. This means continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in-stock and available for our customers when they need it. We will also continue to provide innovative product solutions that simplify the project, saving our customers time and money. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about the innovation we continue to bring to the market. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to, Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, total sales were $40.2 billion, an increase of approximately 6.6% from last year. During the third quarter, our total company comps were negative 1.3% with comps of negative 3.3% in August, negative 2.3% in September and positive 1% in October. Comps in the U.S. were negative 1.2% for the quarter, with comps of negative 3.5% in August, negative 2.2% in September, and positive 1.4% in October. The progression of our monthly comps reflects in large part hurricane related sales. Our results for the third quarter include a net contribution of approximately $200 million in hurricane related sales, which positively impacted total company comps by approximately 55 basis points for the quarter and approximately 120 basis points for October. In the third quarter, our gross margin was approximately 33.4%, a decrease of approximately 40 basis points from the third quarter last year, primarily driven by mix as a result of the SRS acquisition, partially offset by benefits from lower shrink. During the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 45 basis points to 19.9% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our operating expense performance was in-line with our expectations. Our operating margin for the third quarter was 13.5% compared to 14.3% in the third quarter of 2023. In the quarter, pre-tax intangible asset amortization was $138 million including $86 million related to SRS. Excluding the intangible asset amortization in the quarter, our adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was 13.8% compared to 14.5% in the third quarter of 2023. Interest and other expense for the third quarter increased by $157 million to $595 million due primarily to higher debt balances than a year ago. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4% compared to 23.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.67, a decrease of approximately 4% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Excluding intangible asset amortization, our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.78, a decrease of approximately 2% compared to the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter, we opened five new stores, bringing our total store count to 2, 345. Retail selling square footage was approximately 243 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $23.9 billion up approximately $1.1 billion compared to the third quarter of 2023, and inventory turns were 4.8 times, up from 4.3 times last year. Turning to capital allocation. During the third quarter, we invested approximately $820 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Compute on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12-months, return on invested capital was approximately 31.5%, down from 38.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Now, I will comment on our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. As you heard from Ted, while macro uncertainty remains and continues to pressure home improvement demand, our performance in the third quarter was better than expected. Our performance reflects hurricane related sales in the third quarter, and we expect some hurricane related sales in the fourth quarter. Given the better than expected performance in the third quarter and incremental hurricane related sales, we have updated our fiscal 2024 guidance. We now expect total sales growth of approximately 4%, including SRS in the 53rd week. The 53rd week is projected to add approximately $2.3 billion to total sales and SRS is expected to contribute approximately $6.4 billion in incremental sales. Comparable sales are expected to decline approximately 2.5% for the 52 week period. We expect to open approximately 12 new stores. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.5%. We expect operating margin to be approximately 13.5% and adjusted operating margin to be approximately 13.8%. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $2.1 billion. We expect our diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 2% compared to fiscal 2023 with the extra week contributing approximately $0.30 per share. And, we expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 1% compared to fiscal 2023 with the extra week contributing approximately $0.30 per share. We believe that we will grow market share in any environment. We are continuing to invest to strengthen our competitive position with our customers and leverage our scale and low cost position to drive growth faster than the market and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, everyone.\nIsabel Janci: Scott, you\u2019re breaking up. Can you repeat your question, please?\nScot Ciccarelli: Sorry about that. Sales were better than we would have expected. I know you guys outlined hurricane specific, but do you have any comment on the open market because obviously it was quite favorable --\nIsabel Janci: Scott, sorry to cut you off. We can\u2019t really hear you. So, we\u2019re going to go to the next question and we\u2019ll come back to you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. So, starting with the hurricane impact, Richard, you called out about 55 basis points in Q3. Any color on category impacts and if those sales skewed more DIY versus pro? And, then as you think about Q4, how would you characterize the implied down 2.5% comp guide between hurricane driven and the underlying business?\nTed Decker: I\u2019ll let Billy.\nBilly Bastek: Yes. Hey, Zach, it\u2019s Billy. And, then I\u2019ll turn it over to Richard to answer the back half of that question. Just in terms of the hurricane piece, obviously, pretty similar to all events. Think about generators, think about cleanup. You think about obviously lumber as it relates to what we do to help our communities get ready for those events. So, pretty similar from a product assortment standpoint. And obviously, all that\u2019s consumer-driven as customers ready themselves for that event. And I\u2019ll flip it to Richard to answer the back half of that.\nRichard McPhail: Yes. So, Zach just talking about the guide of 2.5% for the year, our guidance really principally reflects the outperformance that we saw in Q3 driven by hurricane related sales as well as reflecting the fact that we just saw exceptional weather across the entire country for most of the quarter. So, the full-year view is basically the flow through of that Q3 performance with some Q4 impact of hurricane related sales.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Appreciate the color. And, just taking a step back, how much of your business would you categorize as needs based versus discretionary today? And, is it still fair to say that the larger and bigger ticket projects are being deferred while needs based break fix type projects are getting done? And, also any color on how those two buckets have been trending through the year?\nTed Decker: Yes. Zach, that\u2019s always difficult to parse out needs based versus discretionary project. We would say your needs based projects are getting done. We\u2019ve talked about there being strong engagement in home improvement and certainly with our pros, but the larger more discretionary projects are the ones that are being deferred and that balance has been consistent throughout this year.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Thanks so much for the time.\nTed Decker: Thank you.\nZach Fadem: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. Can you discuss SRS and the progress you\u2019ve made in cross-selling products and services across the two businesses? And, then can you also touch on the volume contribution specifically in the third quarter?\nTed Decker: Sure. So, we\u2019re very pleased with our progress with SRS. As I said in my prepared remarks, job one is to support them executing their play of growing their business which they do with what we would call comp growth through their existing branches, opening up new branches and then doing tuck in M&A. They\u2019ve continued to do that through the third quarter. They opened a number of branches. They grew the business and they even made a couple small tuck-in acquisitions. So, the strategic game plan for SRS is proceeding as expected. On the cross-sell opportunity, the initial things we\u2019re working on is to make their catalog available to our customers largely through the Pro Desk and through our outside sales resources and we\u2019re seeing terrific take up on that. The comp sales of SRS product through The Home Depot ecosystem, while obviously a very small base is accelerating incredible sort of triple-digit comp growth with those specific sales. And then, we\u2019re also beginning to quote our product into their customer base. Now, remember they\u2019re specialty trade and they\u2019re focused on roofers, landscapers, folks putting down hardscapes in backyards and then working on repairing and maintaining pools and irrigation. However, those customers do engage in some broader home improvement activity and we\u2019ve already begun to actively quote our broader catalog into their customer base. Very, very early days, but the sales teams are working together incredibly well getting to know each other, going on some joint customer calls together. So, early days on that, but again the strategic thesis is playing out exactly how we had hoped.\nRichard McPhail: And Chuck, you asked for specifics. They contributed $2.9 billion in the third quarter. They\u2019re on track to deliver the expected $6.4 billion in sales contribution for the roughly seven months that we\u2019ll end them.\nChuck Grom: Okay, great. Thanks very much. And then one for you, Richard, on gross margins, down 40 basis points. It sounds like SRS was the lion share. Is there any way to double click on that and just unpack? I think it was about 35 basis points of pressure last quarter. And then just looking out, can we think about broader puts and takes for gross margins? I mean relative to where you were pre-COVID which was north of 34%. How do we think about the gross margin trajectory over the next few years? Thanks.\nRichard McPhail: Sure. Well, so specifically, look when you look year-over-year, the major impact in gross margin versus last year was simply the mix impact from SRS. And so, that was actually an 80 basis point impact for the quarter. So, let\u2019s talk about gross margin. It was in-line with our expectations. In fact, our guidance for gross margin for the full-year has not changed. So again, in Q3, the impact was around 80 basis points from SRS. So, you can do the math and see that the remainder of the business was up significantly and was in-line with our expectations, and that also reflected benefits from shrink that Ann had mentioned. And, just to remind you, SRS will be for the year 2024, it will have about a 45 basis point impact on the year because remember, we will have only owned them for about seven months. But, an annualized number for SRS impact to gross margin is about 70 basis points. So, if you just allow me a second to make sure everyone got that, that\u2019s 70 basis points of expected shift in our gross margin profile from adding them to our business. Our gross margin again was right where we expected it to be. Transportation expense or rather benefits from decreasing transportation expense were dynamic in the first half of the year, but that\u2019s largely sort of gone away as year-over-year comparisons flatten out. And so, we were very pleased with our margin performance. And as I said, we have not changed our guidance for the full-year gross margin. Look, as far as long-term goes, in June of 2023, at our Investor Conference, we laid out a base case that in essence said, look, we anticipate flat gross margin as part of our operating model. There\u2019s a ton of productivity that our amazing supply chain team drives every single year that we reinvest in that gross margin, but that\u2019s reflective of our position as the sharpest value in the market for our customers and that\u2019s our intention. But again, the acquisition of SRS does present a shift in our margin base for the business.\nChuck Grom: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Sigman: Hey, good morning, everyone. Nice progress in the quarter. My main question is around market share. Obviously, macro and housing matters a lot here, but you\u2019re also doing a lot to better serve your customer and all the different types of customers. I guess, in that context, it does seem like Home Depot\u2019s performance improved relative to the industry this quarter. Can you speak to that? And, any specific categories you would call out where you do think you\u2019re gaining more share? Thanks.\nTed Decker: I\u2019ll hit on the broader topic and pass over to Billy. We\u2019ve always said it is tough to parse out market share. But if you look at PC expenditures in home, in furnishings those were deeper negative as reported in government statistics in our results. So, if you look at that broader macro, we would the highest-level macro, we would say we took share and then we obviously look at reported results from competitors who are functioning in certain product categories that we operate in. And again in most of those, we see our businesses outperforming those of publicly traded companies results. And Billy, if you want to hit on some categories?\nBilly Bastek: Yes. As we said in our prepared remarks, certainly our seasonal performance, we saw increased great engagement across our seasonally related categories and that includes Halloween. Paint continues to be a great story for us. And, while we did see some exterior business just related on the weather that we called out, we\u2019re certainly making great progress with the pro that paints, our partnerships with BEHR, PPG, our in-store service model enhancements, our job site delivery expansion has really helped us grow share in that segment and really pleased with the performance of the team there. And then, you talk about building materials, continue to see really strong performance in our building materials. That\u2019s multiple quarters on top of multiple quarters. So, as Ted mentioned, pretty hard to kind of parse that out. We look at a lot of different data sets, but feel very confident that in any market we\u2019re going to continue to take share. But, that\u2019s a few of the areas that we\u2019ve seen great continued acceleration and as I mentioned in building materials specifically ongoing terrific improvement there.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess a follow-up question would be around big ticket more specifically. It does seem like it took a step down this quarter even in light of hurricane, certain categories you mentioned like generators. How do you categorize that? I mean you mentioned interest rates. Do you think there was some election noise? I mean I guess ultimately we\u2019re trying to think about what needs to change in your view to really get those categories inflecting?\nTed Decker: Well, if maybe I\u2019ll just step back on how we look at this overall environment and what we\u2019re seeing. I mean clearly our sales during the quarter as we said were more favorable than we expected a lot with weather and hurricane related demand. And, don\u2019t forget on weather, it\u2019s not just that you\u2019re doing garden because the weather is nice. Think of limited days loss from a pro because they can be out of the job site through virtually every day in October it was dry throughout the country. Now, the issue we continue to watch are the macroeconomic uncertainties in the higher rate environment that continues to pressure larger remodeling projects. So, we look at the reversion of personal consumption from goods to services that\u2019s largely worked its way out and we\u2019ve largely navigated our way through the pull-forward of demand that we saw during the pandemic. So, again today this higher rate environment is pressuring the larger normally debt financed remodeling projects as well as existing home sales. So, we all know that the Fed\u2019s cut interest rates two cycles here. But, from the cut in September, mortgage rates have actually increased about 60 basis points. So, two rate cuts combined 75 basis points, yet the 10 year and then therefore the mortgage rates are up about 60 basis points. That continues to impact housing turnover, which were just about 3% of homes turning over, which is a 40 year low at this point. And, you might say that the worst is behind us, how much lower are we going to go, usually we\u2019re at about 4.5%, 5% turnover. I think we actually touched on sort of 2.99%. So, one could argue we\u2019re near the low there. But, then the larger projects often require financing whether it\u2019s cash out financing or home equity lines of credit. Those are down. So, our HELOCs those track more directly the drop in short-term rates. So, those are down 75 basis points, but still historically high at over 8%. So with that, we\u2019re encouraged with certain green shoots if you will in the business with the pull-forward working its way through the categories that Billy just went through. But, what we\u2019re looking for is just one is the timing of homeowners starting those larger remodeling projects. So, we remain super bullish on the outlook for home improvement. We\u2019ll have to work our way through this current macro uncertainty and the interest rates pressuring home improvement demand, but this is a market after all and markets return to equilibrium and remodeling will as well. We just don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite there yet.\nSeth Sigman: I got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Zaccone: Great. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on gross margin briefly. So in the quarter, was there any mix pressure on gross margin from the higher hurricane related sales? And then, just to follow-up on the longer-term, there\u2019s a good amount of discussion around shrink. You\u2019ve made a lot of progress there. Can you help us understand how much of an opportunity that is over the medium-term? Is this something that\u2019s in the 10 basis points to 20 basis points, or could it be something more meaningful over time?\nRichard McPhail: Right. Yes. So, as far as gross margin goes for the quarter, there was a slight amount of mix pressure to margin. And, just think about how Billy characterizes at the beginning of hurricane prep and then through cleanup, you\u2019re just selling higher volumes of lower gross margin goods. And so, there was some slight pressure there. And, as far as shrink goes, look, we are frankly just head down and the teams are working so hard every single day. They have made major investments, not just financially, but also in the amazing number of initiatives they\u2019ve brought forward to combat, in essence, the results of organized retail theft and other crime. This is a problem for all of retail. It\u2019s hard to quantify. What we can tell you is that our investments are paying off. They\u2019ve led now to multiple quarters of benefits year-over-year, tangible results from investments we\u2019ve made. That does not mean that the operating environment is getting any easier. In fact, it\u2019s getting harder and harder. So, our hats are off to our teams, and it\u2019s an everyday initiative that our teams are fighting every single day.\nSteven Zaccone: Yes, understood. My follow-up question, I know there\u2019s no 2025 guidance today, but I think as we I\u2019m curious like as you look at the backdrop, right, the view for 2024 was like housing was going to be net neutral. As you sit here today, it\u2019s tough to kind of call rates. But as you think about \u201925 would you think the housing backdrop turns a little bit more favorable for you, or is it still like think about housing as net neutral as kind of the base case scenario?\nTed Decker: Well, Steven, I\u2019d repeat the comments I just made. One could argue that the rate environment is settling down in turnover certainly even under 3% last reported period would be at a low, but just don\u2019t know and not obviously ready to talk about \u201825 and they\u2019re not ready as we sit here today to call that this is a turn on larger remodeling projects.\nSteven Zaccone: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Thanks, guys. I apologize for the tech issues. Richard, I know you outlined the impact of hurricane related sales, but is there a broader estimate for the weather impact in the quarter? And then second, can you guys give us an idea of the magnitude of difference in performance in the 17 markets where you rolled out incremental pro capabilities versus the rest of the base just so we can better understand the impact that those capabilities are having? Thanks.\nTed Decker: So, the first part of your question, Scot, look, we had outstanding weather across the country. So, it becomes harder to parse out what the weather impact is when you literally don\u2019t have a control group. However, we know when the sun was shining, our customers were engaged and that\u2019s huge testament to our merchants and our operators for inspiring them to do outdoor projects and the like. So, it\u2019s hard to parse out weather, and therefore, we\u2019re cautious with respect to extrapolating Q3, just given how favorable the weather truly was across the country. And Ann, Chip, maybe you can talk about pro markets.\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Yes, I\u2019ll jump in and I\u2019ll turn it over a little to Chip and Hector. But as we\u2019ve mentioned, just tremendous opportunity as we think about greater share of wallet with the complex pro, and we invest in across the end-to-end, experience. We have talked about previously of what we\u2019re doing with capabilities on the complex side of the business. And today, I highlighted a lot of great work that Hector and his team is doing with the in-store pro. And, when we think about it across the entire ecosystem, we want to have a great experience outside the stores, and we want to have a great experience inside the store. So, we have to be working on these initiatives simultaneously. To your point, the more they engage with our capabilities, we are seeing tremendous upside. And, it\u2019s important for us as we think about these 17 markets to ensure that we\u2019re delivering an excellent experience where we build the level of confidence. So Chip, I know you continue to work on some key capabilities and if you\u2019re going to turn it over to Hector on some of the things he\u2019s doing in-store.\nChip Devine: Yes. Thanks Ann. And Scot, we\u2019re very encouraged in what\u2019s going on in the 17 investment markets where we\u2019ve been building out the ecosystem that Ann referenced. The investment in our foundational capabilities, breadth and depth of inventory, supply chain, delivery and importantly our sales force has led to share gains and outperformance in all those markets, low-single-digits in those markets. So very, very pleased. As Billy mentioned, these customers that are interacting with our ecosystem are some of our very best performing customers. Just as an example, we\u2019ve launched our trade credit offering where it\u2019s early days, but it is really resonating with our customers and we\u2019ve been able to take share in some of their projects that we normally cannot participate in. So, very pleased with what\u2019s happening. Hector?\nHector Padilla: Yes. And Scot, I would just add that we are super pleased with the engagement of our team in-store to drive just a great experience for that in-store pro. Had mentioned some of the strategic adjustments that we made going into the second half of the year to drive that engagement from our leaders. We\u2019re laser focused on driving speed and ease for checkout for our pros, making sure that we are driving in-stock on large quantities of the products that the customers need and integrating the tools and resources and features that Chip and team are developing for the outside pro that are also, adding value to the in-store pro experience. So, we just like how the ecosystem is coming together in those markets and beyond.\nOperator: Does that complete your question? Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Ted, are you looking at the multi-year home improvement outlook as the longer that rates remain elevated, the more that homeowners are deferring projects and as soon as rates come down, that will lead to a more robust recovery. So, there\u2019s a relationship between what\u2019s happening right now and the magnitude of the recovery. And I guess as part of that, if rates don\u2019t come down next year, can the home improvement industry grow in 2025?\nTed Decker: Yes. Michael, we think about that quite a bit as you can imagine. I mean certainly rates have been high. They pressured turnover most specifically, but even HELOC extraction. HELOC extraction is something like 25% right now of more recent period extraction. So, clearly rates are impacting. But, I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019ve talked about when rates came down towards the 6% we immediately saw activity in housing. And, we were seeing that just a matter of weeks, months ago before this latest change when rates actually went up. I think there\u2019s a little bit of so much discussion about where rates are going and that the certainty of that they were going down has caused people to wait for that lower rate. But, if you get stability at sort of any rate might be more important at this point. So, once rates settle and there\u2019s probably a gradual easing of rates, but I don\u2019t think we need a dramatic drop. We just need the talk of the big drops are coming and market equilibrium will set in. Either that or people simply get used to the higher rates, which historically are still pretty decent rates. And, life cycles will continue, new household formation, increasing size of home, decreasing size of homes, second homes that normal equilibrium of housing activity will be reestablished. We\u2019ve just had such a dramatic increase in value, increase in rates followed by this expectation of a meaningful short-term drop in rates over a very short period of time that has changed that stable turnover rate that we\u2019ve seen for years-and-years to be what now you would argue could be a low. So, I don\u2019t think again to answer your question that they have to drop quickly and meaningfully. They just need to stabilize and all the talk of what the Fed is going to do sort of gets out of the national conversation.\nMichael Lasser: Got you. It\u2019s very helpful. My follow-up question is, I want to get the team\u2019s perspective on tariffs. So as part of that, what percentage of sales for the Home Depot could be subject to tariffs in China, and, what about from other countries? And, is the bigger risk from tariffs related to the sheer increase in merchandise costs or the indirect impact of potentially reaccelerating inflation and that impact on consumer spending? Thank you.\nTed Decker: Sure. And I\u2019ll let Billy and John Deaton who runs our supply chain comment on tariffs. I would say, first and foremost, whatever happens in tariffs will be an industry-wide impact, it won\u2019t discriminate against different retailers and distributors who are importing goods. The type of product as an industry is generally sourced from the same countries. There has been some diversification of those sources, but clearly a bit of concentration in Southeast Asia and China in particular. We source well more than half of our goods domestically and in North America, but there certainly will be an impact. But again given our scale, our experience going through the previous tariffs on at 25% on I guess was a couple of $100 billion of industry import goods going back a number of years ago, I\u2019d bet on this team\u2019s ability to work with the type of suppliers we have to work through this in a differentiated manner than others in the industry. But Billy and John, why don\u2019t you give some input?\nBilly Bastek: Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Billy. Thanks. As Ted mentioned, I mean, our teams have been through this before. We anticipate we\u2019ll manage through any new tariffs similarly to how we\u2019ve done this in the past. As Ted mentioned, the majority of our goods are sourced in North America. And listen, we\u2019ve been focused on diversifying, sourcing for several years and we\u2019ll continue to assess that going forward. And I\u2019ll hand it to John. I mean, we\u2019re focused on that, but frankly there\u2019s some other things that John and the team are also focused on.\nJohn Deaton: Yes. More near-term, we\u2019re focused on the resolution of the East Coast port situation and any implications that might have on our ability to move product through our supply chain. As Billy and Ted said, we have a lot of experience in this area in terms of being able to manage through these types of disruptions and these types of changes in terms of trade policy and we feel very confident with our ability to manage through whatever is to come in the future.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much.\nTed Decker: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi, good morning everyone. First, a short-term question on Q3 to Q4. You mentioned Q3 exceeded expectations ex-the hurricanes. There was weather and you mentioned that weather helped as well. And, thinking about the movement to Q4, it looks like it\u2019s a decel on stacks and obviously the absolute number. So, is the assumption that weather is less helpful? Is there some conservatism or any other things that change into the fourth quarter?\nRichard McPhail: Thanks, Simeon. It\u2019s Richard. Look, bottom line, we don\u2019t expect the fundamentals of our business to decelerate. We\u2019re just being cautious about extrapolating Q3 results that saw significant benefit from weather. And also just as a reminder, the guide is for approximately negative 2.5% comp sales.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay, fair enough. Then second on the macro, this is trying to get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking and I know a lot of it this call was helpful in that regard. The weight that you\u2019re thinking about in terms of tappable equity, which we\u2019ve talked about recently versus something like housing turnover, both are impacted by rates. But could this tappable equity idea become like a lock-in effect at some point? When does that kick in? Can it kick in even with rates being higher?\nRichard McPhail: Yes. The question is often posed to us, hey with housing turnover there\u2019s obviously more spend and if you don\u2019t move then you remove the place. And, while we haven\u2019t, we\u2019ve seen the decrease in moving one does the repair or the remodel in place take effect. Clearly that has been delayed and we would point to the higher rates. But even more importantly, our surveys over the prior several months more than cost of project and higher rates, the number one issue that people were citing in our surveys were general macroeconomic and even political uncertainty. So as those dissipate, I think you\u2019ll see people again with the lower rates HELOCs are variable. So, those are down 75 basis points since the cuts and assuming, we\u2019re going to get another cut here in December, huge amount of tappable equity that\u2019s nearly doubled since the end of \u201819. It went from just under $6 trillion to $11.5 trillion I mean a T, trillion with a T. So, tremendous amount of tappable equity. Recall back in the housing boom, I think folks were taking out as much as $120 billion a quarter. That was more recently $60 billion, $80 billion a quarter and now we\u2019re down to $20 billion a quarter. So, don\u2019t think it goes much lower. When people get some confidence back in macro and political dynamic, it\u2019s a big project. And, for someone to make that decision to pull the trigger on $25,000, $50,000, $75,000 project, there\u2019s a certain amount of confidence that goes into that. And, one would hope that we\u2019re headed toward a change in overall confidence levels.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you.\nIsabel Janci: And Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. Ted, appreciate the color around cross-selling opportunities at SRS. But, I wanted to explore maybe some of the learnings you\u2019re gaining from monitoring the sales force over there. So, can you remind us on how large the sales force is today at SRS and what you\u2019re tracking to maybe inform your decision on how you\u2019re thinking about scaling the sales force at HD?\nTed Decker: Right. So, their outside sales force is about 2,500 people. They also have inside sales force capabilities and account managers. It\u2019s observing what they do and how they do it has given us confidence in what our approach is in terms of variable compensation, in terms of management structure, and how we go to market. So clearly, we\u2019re in the 100 of outside sales folks. There are multiples of that and the way they\u2019re compensated, managed, the tools they use to go to market, all that is reinforcing what we\u2019re doing. Chip mentioned the credit. Credit is a huge unlock for these larger projects and almost all their sales are on open account, house account. And, as we\u2019ve introduced and again it\u2019s just hundreds of customers at this time. We\u2019re seeing much, much larger purchases, the type of purchase that you just wouldn\u2019t get from putting it on a credit card at a Pro Desk at a Home Depot store. So, yes, great learnings. Chip and his team are in contact regularly with the SRS sales team and just going really, really well.\nSteven Forbes: And then, maybe just a quick follow-up on that. Can you maybe just update us on the current timeline or thinking behind the full rollout of bill upon delivery capabilities within the order management system?\nChip Devine: Yes. Hi, Steve, it\u2019s Chip. We plan to rollout order management by the end of 2025. There\u2019s elements of order management that are being turned on as we speak including inventory reservation, which is a key win for us as pros manage larger projects to be able to reserve that inventory for future delivery is a big win. So, we\u2019ll light that up through the course of 2025 with completion at the end of the year.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ms. Janci, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thanks, Christine. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "HD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-08-13 12:45:30", "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to The Home Depot Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

If we are unable to get your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures including, but not limited to adjusted income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share. For a reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP measures to our corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release and our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $43.2 billion, an increase of 0.6% from the same period last year. Our sales in the quarter include $1.3 billion from SRS. Recall that we closed on the SRS acquisition on June 18, and we've included approximately six weeks of their performance in our consolidated results. Comp sales declined 3.3% from the same period last year, and our U.S. stores had negative comps of 3.6%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.67 in the second quarter, compared to $4.68 in the second quarter of last year. The team continues to navigate this unique environment while executing at a high level. During the quarter, higher interest rates and greater macroeconomic uncertainty pressured consumer demand more broadly, resulting in weaker spend across home improvement projects. Additionally, we saw continued softness in spring projects, which were also impacted by the extreme weather changes throughout the quarter. When we look at the performance in the first six months of the year, as well as continued uncertainty around underlying consumer demand, we believe a more cautious sales outlook is warranted for the year. Richard will take you through the details in a moment, but we are now guiding to a comp sales decline of approximately 3% to 4% for fiscal 2024. Regardless of the current pressure in the environment, our team remains focused on serving our customers and ensuring we have the right products at the right values. And we remain focused on long-term share growth in the highly fragmented approximately $1 trillion home improvement market. Remember, we operate in one of the largest asset classes which is estimated at approximately $45 trillion, representing the installed base of homes in the United States. Today, we have roughly 17% market share with tremendous growth potential. That is why we have been investing and executing on our strategy to create the best interconnected experience for a Pro wallet share through a differentiated set of capabilities and build new stores. Now I'll take a few moments to comment on our acquisition of SRS Distribution. SRS has an exceptional team with a proven growth track record, and we are thrilled to welcome them into The Home Depot family. While our financials only reflect a portion of their first half performance for the first six-month period matching our first half, they generated high single-digit top line growth while growing operating income largely in line with sales compared to the previous year. We are incredibly excited about what we can achieve together by leveraging our combined assets, capabilities and competitive advantages. We plan to drive incremental growth through several sales and cross synergy opportunities. We'll make their more comprehensive product offering in roofing, pool and landscape available to all our customers through our Pro desk, and we will offer SRS customers a form of credit tied to their account, which will make purchases at Home Depot stores much more convenient. The fundamentals of the home improvement market remain strong, and we have significant growth opportunities in front of us. We are gaining share of wallet with our customers whether they are shopping in our stores, on our digital assets or through our Pro ecosystem. Our merchants, store and MET teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams are always ready to serve in any environment. They did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter, and I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. With that, let me turn the call over to Ann.\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. As you heard from Ted, despite the environment, our associates continue to be engaged and ready to serve our customers. We know that delivering the best shopping experience for any purchase occasion is critical to our success. That is why we continue to invest in our associates, our in-store capabilities, our fulfillment channels and the customer experience. Over the past year, we have talked about the tool that help us create this differentiated experience. Specifically, our focus on in-stock and on-shelf availability or OSA with our Sidekick and Computer Vision applications. Today, our in-stock and OSA are at best-in-class levels and provides the foundation for a fast in-and-out convenient experience that many of our customers' desires, especially our Pro customers. We have also enhanced the tools our associates use for our in-store Pros and specialty selling. Within the MyView tool, which has many in-store applications, we have given our associates better visibility to our customers' activity with The Home Depot. For example, for our in-store Pros, we can see sales trends, specific buying patterns and expiring perks, equipping our associates with insights to better partner with share wallet and deliver value for our customers. To drive conversion for specialty customers, we launched a new platform known as Pipeline Management that enables interconnected product selling for kitchen designs. With this tool, associates and store leaders, will now be able to have a consolidated digital view of their pipeline and all activities related to our customer's journey. This allows associates to more easily manage multiple complex projects, while more effectively communicating with our customers throughout their journey. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our organic efforts around our different assets and capabilities to grow share of wallet with a complex project purchase occasion. We are pleased to announce that we now have key full capabilities in 17 markets, including a broader product assortment, digital assets, a sales force and broader fulfillment options. Our trade credit pilot program is also underway, and while it's still early days, we have seen the program resonate with our customers and the benefits of extending credit for larger scale products that are stayed for a longer period of time. We are also making progress on our order management system as we continue to roll out enhancements to the end-to-end selling system. We are very excited about our continued success serving the complex product certification and are focused on delivering the best customer service to all our customers. Our store readiness and execution is strong and our associates are engaged. I look forward to the many opportunities ahead of us, and I want to thank all our associates for all they do to take care of our customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\nBilly Bastek: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the second quarter, the higher interest rate environment and greater macroeconomic uncertainty pressured overall project demand. In addition, our sales reflect a softer spring selling season, which was also impacted by extreme changes in the weather throughout the quarter. Turning to our merchandising department comp performance for the second quarter. Our plumbing department posted a positive comp, while power, building materials, appliances and paint were all above the Company average. During the second quarter, our comp transactions decreased 2.2% and comp average ticket decreased to 1.3%. However, during the quarter, we continued to see our customers trading up for new and innovative products. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were down 5.8%, compared to the second quarter of last year. We continue to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund the project such as kitchen and bath remodels. Pro's outperformed the DIY customer, but both were negative for the quarter. We saw positive growth with Pro's who engage in Pro Extra program, deliveries to the job site and our B2B website. Turning to total company online sales. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 4%, compared to the second quarter of last year. And for those customers that chose to transact with us online during the second quarter, nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores. In addition, during the second quarter, we expanded our partnership with Instacart to improve the interconnected shopping experience nationwide. While we are still in the early days of our expanded partnership, we are encouraged with the results we are seeing. During the second quarter, we leaned into products and projects that are resonating with our customers. We updated some line structures focused on innovation and continue to deliver a compelling value proposition while focusing on the customer experience. For example, we upgraded the durability of all Lifeproof Vinyl Plank, while also introducing on-trend colors, patterns and length. This helped drive positive comps in the category for the quarter. In water heaters, we recently modified our line structure to better serve the Pro customer needs. We simplified our value proposition, adding new and better features, which drove increased engagement in the category. And in paint, we continue to see the benefits of the investments we are making around our products and our fulfillment options, including our in-store service and job site delivery capabilities with the Pro who paints driving continued share gains in the quarter. And finally, we continue to see tremendous success in our outdoor power equipment categories, driving both positive unit and dollar comps in the quarter. As we've mentioned before, we have built a strong competitive advantage with our extensive lineup of battery-powered platforms that allows us to continue to grow share in these categories. As we look ahead to the third quarter, our merchandising organization remains focused on being our customers' advocate for value. This means continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in-stock and available for our customers when they need it. We will also continue to lean into products that simplify the project, saving our customers time and money. That's why I'm so excited about the innovation we continue to bring to the market. This quarter, we are launching the first-to-market smart glass door with Feather River. Feather River is a leader in the fiberglass door market and continues to bring innovation to our customers. This new door technology allows customers to easily change the glass from privacy or frosted to clear with a push of a button and is compatible with our hub space ecosystem. This will be exclusive to The Home Depot in the big box retail channel. Additionally, we continue to lean in with our exclusive partner in Milwaukee across the business and have seen great adoption of electrical hand tools. Our partnership is expanding with a broader assortment of Made in the USA tools. These tools provide a high degree of precision with lasting results for our Pro customers and will continue to strengthen our position as the number one destination for the electrical trade in the big box retail channel. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, Total sales were $43.2 billion, an increase of approximately 0.6% from last year. Total sales include $1.3 billion from the recent acquisition of SRS, which represents approximately six weeks of sales in the quarter. During the second quarter, our total company comps were negative 3.3%, with comps of negative 3.7% in May, negative 0.9% in June and negative 4.9% in July. Comps in the U.S. were negative 3.6% for the quarter, with comps of negative 4.1% in May, negative 1.4% in June and negative 5% in July. In the second quarter, our gross margin was approximately 33.4%, an increase of 40 basis points from the second quarter last year, primarily driven by benefits from lower transportation costs and shrink, partially offset by mix as a result of the SRS acquisition. During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 65 basis points to 18.3% compared to the second quarter of 2023. Our operating expense performance was in line with our expectations. Beginning this quarter, in addition to our GAAP measures, we are providing the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes noncash amortization of acquired intangible assets. We believe these supplemental measures will help investors better understand and analyze our performance. Our operating margin for the second quarter was 15.1% compared to 15.4% in the second quarter of 2023. In the quarter, pretax intangible asset amortization was $90 million, including $39 million related to SRS. Excluding the intangible asset amortization in the quarter, our adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 15.3% and compared to 15.5% in the second quarter of 2023. Interest and other expense for the second quarter increased by $61 million to $489 million due primarily to higher debt balances than a year ago. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.5%, compared to 24.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.60, a decrease of approximately 1% compared to the second quarter of 2023. Excluding intangible asset amortization, our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.67, essentially flat compared to the second quarter of 2023. During the second quarter, we opened three new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,340. Retail selling square footage was approximately 243 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories or $23.1 billion, down approximately $200 million compared to the second quarter of 2023, and inventory turns were 4.9x, up from 4.4x last year. Turning to capital allocation. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $720 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. First and foremost, we will invest in the business and expect capital expenditures of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. After investing in the business, we plan to pay the dividend and it is our intent to return any excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 31.9%, down from 41.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Now, I will comment on our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. As you heard from Ted, given the softer-than-expected performance in the first half of the year, and reflecting continued uncertainty around underlying consumer demand, we believe a more cautious outlook for the year is warranted. With the recent closing of the SRS acquisition, we are now including their results in our consolidated outlook for the year. For the period matching our first half, which includes periods prior to the acquisition and not fully reflected in our financial statements, SRS generated high single-digit percentage sales growth with operating income growing largely in line with sales. We believe that over the next several years, SRS on its own, and through our combined Pro efforts, will help accelerate sales and earnings growth for our company. Updating our fiscal 2024 guidance for the factors we just discussed. We now expect total sales growth between 2.5% and 3.5%, including the SRS acquisition and the 53rd week. The 53rd week is projected to add approximately $2.3 billion to total sales. SRS is expected to contribute approximately $6.4 billion in incremental sales. Comparable sales are expected to decline between negative 3% and negative 4% for the 52-week period. The high end of our range implies a consumer demand environment consistent with the first half of fiscal 2024. While comparable sales for the Company are not currently on the trajectory for the low end of the range, a negative 4% comp implies incremental pressure on consumer demand beyond what we are seeing today. We expect to open approximately 12 new stores. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.5%. We expect operating margin to be between 13.5% and 13.6%, and adjusted operating margin to be between 13.8% and 13.9%. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $2.2 billion. Our diluted earnings per share percent will decline between negative 2% and negative 4% compared to fiscal 2023, with the extra week contributing approximately $0.30. We expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share percent to decline between negative 1% and negative 3%, compared to fiscal 2023, with the extra week contributing approximately $0.30. We believe that we have positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment. The investments we've made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model. As we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen our position with our customers, leverage our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: So, it sounds like you guys are seeing a bit more of a shift towards, let's call it, broader consumer weakness from what previously seemed to be hesitancy around finance projects. Can you provide a couple of examples just so we can better understand kind of the incremental hesitancy on consumer spending patterns?\nTed Decker: Well, I think it's just in broader projects, Scott. As we said in the prior couple of few quarters, the consumer remains engaged. Our consumer, in particular, remains quite healthy. Again, these are consumers who have seen their home values go up 50% in the last four years, their home equity has increased almost 70% since the -- right before the pandemic. So that translates to over $13 trillion. Equity values have been strong, jobs are strong, earnings are strong. But we saw engagement the last several quarters in smaller projects. What we saw this most recent quarter is further pressure in larger projects. And we see that in building materials in lumber categories that are very specifically tied to construction in a larger project. And that was really the change that we saw as the quarter progressed.\nScot Ciccarelli: So, in other words, like it's not necessarily broadening out, but it's increased pressure on, let's call it, project-oriented purchases?\nTed Decker: Yes. And you said it. I mean the change that we believe happened over the course of the quarter. And so, if you go back a bit to the environment that we've been working through this period of moderation, the first thing we saw was a shift in spending -- PCE spending from goods back into services. And we're effectively through that transition, the relative share spend is more or less equal to where it was before the pandemic. And then we had, some certainly some pull forward in our segment. I'd say we're not completely through the pull forward, but largely. I mean we're now going on four years from the first spring of the pandemic when people were buying lots of grills and patio furniture et cetera. We're largely working our way through that. And then, the higher interest rate started to impact the housing market in housing turnover in particular, which is down some 40%. And I think last quarter, last month, we saw numbers that on an annualized basis, we're approaching 40-year lows. That's also impacting customers' interest in financing larger projects. Everyone's expecting rates are going to fall. So, we're deferring those projects. But again, what more recently has happened is a broader concern with the macro economy. There's just a lot of noise with political and geopolitical environment, unemployment ticked up, inflation keeps eating away at disposable income. And I think people just took a pause as we progress through the quarter or more of a pause because of these macro uncertainties.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Sigman: I wanted to ask about just performance across different channels. So, core Home Depot retail, I think that's pretty clear. But Home Depot or HD Supply, it seems like it's outperformed, but kind of hard to tell from our side. And then on SRS, if you can maybe just elaborate more on the trends you're seeing there. As you step back and think about, hopefully, an eventual recovery, you've built up this very diverse business over the last few years. I mean how do you think about the timing of these different segments and how they come out of this?\nRichard McPhail: Sure, Seth. Well, we're -- I'll tell you, we're very proud of all components of our business. We are executing at an exceptionally high level across the core and across the businesses that you call out. While we don't split out HD Supply is part of our core, we are proud to say that we have had -- and HD Supply has had an exceptional track record as of late even penetrating through to generate positive sales growth in the second quarter. And so that's a real bright spot for The Home Depot. Now SRS, as we told you when we acquired SRS, this is a growth company acquiring a growth company. SRS has a track record of growing faster than their competition in all of their verticals and has done so for the last 15 years. If you look at what SRS accomplished in the first six months of the year, again, we only own them for six weeks, so we only book six weeks of results. But they grew in the high single-digit percentages in the first half. They had healthy growth in the second quarter and we expect them to, again, book single-digit growth in the entirety of the year 2024, even though we'll only own them for seven months. So, these two business models, HD Supply and SRS are great examples of market leaders who are accustomed to growing share and delivering the bottom line as well.\nTed Decker: Yes. And I'd add to that, Seth, we're not going to break out operating segments. But in HD Supplies case, there's some appropriate comparatives in SRS, there's very much publicly traded comparatives. And we feel really good about the MRO business, the roofing, the pool and the landscape business against those comparables.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. That's super helpful. And then if we just zoom back in on core Home Depot, maybe just speak about your relative performance. If there are categories that you may be seeing some widening gap. You called out a number of categories that seem to be under a lot of cyclical pressure, but were cited as bright spots, outdoor power equipment, you mentioned appliances above average. Obviously, that's been a tough category. I think you even mentioned vinyl plank having positive comps. So maybe just speak to some of those categories and where you may be seeing that widening gap?\nBilly Bastek: Thanks, Seth. So, it's Billy. Listen, as I did mention in our prepared remarks that we continue to talk about the finance projects, we continue to see ongoing pressure. I don't think that's new news. Having said that, we called out a number of businesses that you just mentioned it, vinyl plank, we saw great performance in both sales and unit comps. Water heaters, as I mentioned, certainly, paint. We're thrilled with the efforts we've had in paint with the Pro that paints and our paint business in total. And again, power across our platforms as well. So non-finance projects, while we did see some softness in some of the seasonal pieces that we alluded to in our prepared remarks, the continued ongoing pressure of just the uncertainty as it relates to interest rates, it's going to continue to put some pressure on those finance projects. But we're pleased with some of the other pieces I mentioned, larger ticket, onetime purchase categories like riders as an example, we continue to see good engagement in businesses like that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: What do you think the key level for the 30-year fixed rate mortgage needs to fall to in order to drive Home Depot business higher? And does that rate change, or that level change, is the decrease in rates is due to an erosion in the labor market rather than just a moderation in inflation?\nTed Decker: Michael, full question there. Hard to pinpoint what that magical rate number is historically and then as you say, with some added pressure. All I can do is reference towards the end of last year when rates came off, the high is over 7%, and moderated down, I think even hit below 6.5% there for a bit. You saw an immediate increase in housing activity, mortgage applications, mortgage refi applications. And then unfortunately, the rates spike back up think almost to 7% again. So, we're trending down again. I think you're approaching 6.5% for qualified mortgage. And based on what we saw towards the end of last year, we would think you're approaching a level that people are going to engage. Caveat to that would be, again, this broader economic, geopolitical even concerns that people still might pause a little bit until some of this gets sorted out, which would be understandable, but as rates head down towards 6%, we would expect to see activity. The other thought or piece of this whole puzzle is the amount of folks, as you know, who are in mortgages as low as 3%. And plenty of mortgages under 5%. There's definitely a little bit of a golden handcuff dynamic going on with those rates. But again, as time goes on, family dynamic changes. And for one or two years, you might stay in those golden handcuffs and enjoy the low rate, but family size increases, household formation, moves for employment, retirement, et cetera. So, we would see a gradual unlocking of that even if that adds to a little bit of a delay response to housing for -- from a traditional rate cut environment.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is the longer that this downturn persists, does Home Depot have an inclination to invest more in price or value as a way to grab market share that it could sustain on an eventual upturn? And maybe as a part of this, could you pull apart your updated gross margin guidance to reflect the underlying dynamics within core Home Depot versus the influence of SRS on this line item?\nBilly Bastek: Yes, Michael, thanks. I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll hand it to Richard on a second piece of that question. As it relates to just the promotional activity, I mean, listen, we're going to continue to drive innovation and create value for our consumers. We are in a very rational environment as it relates to the home improvement sector, while there's been some pressure in the category like appliances. We don't see the need nor are in the environment where we need to be more promotional. We're focused on driving innovation and value, creating opportunities for our customers to come into our stores every day. We don't want to be in the promotional business. We feel very good about our position and creating these opportunities and excitement in our stores around just those things, and we've seen great adoption. We've been able to bring value into the marketplace. Areas like our proprietary brands continue to perform very well and we're very pleased with that and don't see a change in really the promotional cadence going forward. Now, I'll toss it to Richard for more on the gross margin piece.\nRichard McPhail: Yes. Great. So let me actually broaden the question because I think it's important to give the broader context, if you're asking about gross margin, let's just talk about SRS for a moment. So, in last June's Investor conference, we laid out a base case and we said that there could be contributors to that base case that would push us to grow sales and earnings faster than that base case, right? So base case was 3% to 4% top line and high single digit -- mid- to high single-digit EPS growth. The acquisition of SRS is one of those accelerants that we pointed to in our investor conference, pushing us towards the accelerated case. The objective of SRS is to grow our share with the Pro, to accelerate sales growth, to accelerate operating profit growth and to accelerate EPS growth. So, from a sales and operating profit perspective, as you can see, it's already contributing to our company immediately. From an EPS perspective, the acquisition of SRS will be cash EPS accretive in the first 12 months of ownership as we said in March. It will be cash EPS accretive in the first 12 months of ownership adjusting for the associated noncash intangible amortization. So, let's talk about how SRS is reflected in our in our financials. Again, just as a reminder, we include six weeks of results in Q2 from SRS, and we will include about seven months of SRS in our full year. So just thinking about SRS, look, they have a different product mix than Home Depot, right? About 2/3 of their product is roofing and then the remaining 1/3 is in pool and landscape. SRS carries similar margins on similar products as The Home Depot. Those products carry a lower gross margin rate than The Home Depot company's average. But their margin simply reflects a different mix than The Home Depot. And so, when we think about gross margin, SRS impacted the second quarter gross margin by about 35 basis points. And if you think about what that means for kind of an annualized figure, you're talking a kind of a reset of our margin profile of about 45 basis points in gross margin. So again, that will be about 35 basis points for 2024. And then if you look at sort of an annualized figure, it's somewhere around 45 basis points. That's kind of a reset to reflect what is, in effect, a new mix of products at The Home Depot. So now let's talk about operating margin and SRS' impact because it's important to look at gross margin in that context. So, if you -- when you add SRS to our mix, it adjusts our base operating margin profile, lowering it by about 30 basis points in Q2 and it lowers our base operating margin profile by just about 40 basis points for the full year of 2024. So that's 40 for the full year of 2024. Again, if you annualize that number, then the adjustment to our base margin from SRS is about 60 basis points for an annual period. And those are GAAP numbers, and we can get into adjusted numbers, if you'd like. When we think about gross margin again for the quarter, we want to point out several exceptional performances across our operators. First of all, significant transportation benefit brought to us by our supply chain partners and our merchant partners and significant benefit from a decrease in shrink year-over-year. We have now put several quarters of shrink benefit versus last year together in a row. And we can point directly at what drives that performance. It's a fantastic team that we continue to invest in. And the returns on those investments are exceptional. That's a long way of saying, if you look at our gross margin performance year-over-year and you back out the SRS mix shift of 35 basis points, we were actually 75 basis points versus last year, an exceptional performance in gross margin across the board by our entire team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: I have a question related to reversion. One way to look at it in 2019, if we look at transactions, they look like they're flat to down a little bit. So to Ted's point earlier, most of that looks like it's given back on transactions. Ticket though, is still up about 30-ish percent, 34%. So -- and I think that's a function of the number of items, consumers reporting in the basket and because there was inflation. My question is, if we look at just the inflation piece, are there any signs of product prices, either deflating, disinflating, the non-commodity stuff, non-lumber. Any signs of pricing changing in the channel?\nTed Decker: No, Simeon, thanks for the question. Your math is sort of spot on there. The good news is no. We're not seeing any broad step down in cost or retails. If you look at what we've laid out for AUR this year, we said that we'd have pressure of about 150 basis points of AUR in the first half, that would moderate to 50 basis points in the second half. That is all a function of lapping the cost and associated retail moves from last year. There really isn't a lot of net new activity on the cost or the retail front. In fact, sort of cost out and cost in activity. We have a very robust team that works with our merchants on this. It's all pretty neutral right now, we're not a ton of activity. So, as Billy said, we're not going to be promotional. We're an EDLP retailer that has to give value to our -- particularly our Pros every day. The cost environment is neutral. The price environment is neutral. We're not seeing a lot of trade down in particular. We're not seeing an increase in OPP penetration. Things are pretty neutral to several last periods of activity. And what we're seeing on the AUR is a matter of lapping. So, we're not seeing that, and we would expect the cost levels from where we are today to largely hold as well as the retail levels. Remember, there's -- in the cost levels from our supplier base, it's not just a matter of input costs in terms of materials, which you understand with our cost finance team, we have a very, very good view into that. But everyone over the last four years has seen significant increase in labor costs, and we're still working through transportation costs. So that 30, you can say, wow, that's highly inflationary, and that has to come back. Well, in fact, the cost structure, labor being a big component has increased similarly. And that's why we don't see the marketplace irrationally eroding those price levels.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Follow-up, trying to think about what the core business is doing in terms of decremental margins in the second half? I think some of Richard's comments before gave us some more clues. But it looks like the EBIT dollar guidance of the whole business, dollars are roughly the same. We have a midpoint now. We had a one single point before. So. whatever we're losing from the core, it seems like we're picking back up in SRS. And it looks like the decrementals are somewhere around 20% to 25%. Is that right? Is that the right run rate if this sort of negative comp or low negative comp environment persists?\nRichard McPhail: So, what I would do is -- let's -- why don't we talk about performance to date and how our guidance reflects the performance to date because we actually have, as I said, outperformed certain expectations in cost of goods sold. And the team has managed expenses in an exceptional manner. And so let me walk through what that means for the guide. So, you can recall, we began the year with a guide of a negative 1% comp with a 14.1% operating margin. In isolation, if we were to take -- well, as we take comp from a negative 1% to a negative 3%, that is, call it, 25 to 30 basis points of natural deleverage that we would see in that reduction in top line expectation. However, we've had favorability year-to-date. We know where it comes from, and that favorability enhances our earnings. And so instead of taking our 14.1% operating margin, and by the way I'm excluding SRS in this discussion, so for simplification, if we were to set SRS to the side for a moment. Naturally, our 14.1% operating margin would drop to something like a 13.9% to a 13.8% at a negative 3%. Instead, at a negative 3%, again, with SRS to the side, we are now guiding operating margin of 14%. So, we have held in essence, that core 14% operating margin at a negative 3% comp. That's because we are flowing through benefits that we have created through investments that we've made. Now, if we include SRS in this, obviously, as I said, there's about a 40-basis point mix shift in our operating margin base. So that 14% becomes the 13.6% that we've guided alongside the negative 3% top end of the range today.\nSimeon Gutman: Got it.\nRichard McPhail: And just to tie it all up together, that 13.6% corresponds with our adjusted operating margin of 13.9%. So, for the year, when we eliminate non-cash amortization expense on intangible assets, we expect to report operating margin of 13.9% on a comp of negative 3%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Grom: You guys talked about SRS revenue growth in the high single-digit range year-to-date, which is really strong in this environment. I'm curious what's driving that success? Were there some acquisitions made by SRS? Has it been all organic? And I guess, how do we think about that growth rate as we move into '25?\nTed Decker: Thanks, Chuck. Yes, they remain a robust share-taking grower, and that high single digit is split between -- roughly equally split between organic growth and lapping of acquisitions.\nCharles Grom: Okay. Great. And any thoughts on how the pace of that will go into '25?\nTed Decker: Yes. We wouldn't give any guidance in the '25. But remember, their mode of growth, which they have demonstrated this since inception in the mid-2000s, is there a balanced grower between comping their existing branches, their open base of branches, opening greenfield branches and then some roll up M&A, geographical customer list add-on. So, that's the profile that they've grown for years, and that is exactly the profile that we will support going forward.\nRichard McPhail: And just for clarity's sake, SRS is not in our comp base. And so, they are not reflected in our comp sales guidance. They will become comp once we've owned them for 12 months.\nCharles Grom: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Richard, you've talked about the consumer deferring projects over the past few quarters. But as the prospects for lower rates begin to materialize, I mean we can start to see the line of sight for maybe a 6% mortgage rate. Is it possible that the pace of deferrals begins to ramp higher over the next couple of quarters? And if that's the case, what parts of your business do you think could be most exposed?\nRichard McPhail: Well, intuitively, it's probably the converse of what we've seen. You think about the categories and Billy, please chime in, but those things that are components of the large project, kitchen, bath, flooring, lighting are all under pressure. And our customers tell us it's because that large project is being deferred. We're certainly not going to try to call timing. But just to echo what Ted said, there is certainly a direct relationship between decreases in mortgage rates and the amount of activity that you at least see picking up in turnover. And so, I think the important point here is, as we've said for years, the long-term fundamentals of home improvement demand are strong. We have continued to invest through this period of moderation. We -- 2024 marks the highest amount of CapEx that we've invested back in the business really in the last 15 years because we are bullish on the future. And timing is uncertain, but we're going to be ready for it.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nagel: So, my first question, just with respect to the pace of comps, so the numbers you gave at your prepared remarks, there was a mark slowdown from June to July. Is there anything that's notable there? Or was it just that growing delays we talked about?\nBilly Bastek: Yes, Brian, thanks for the question. And to reiterate in our comps, we were minus 3.7%, minus 0.9% and then a minus 4.9%. While we did see some softness in July, as we alluded to in Ted's comments, there's no question that the extreme heat took some sales in weather-related categories, think ACs and fans, think air circulation, think watering, those typically come for us in the July timeframe, and we saw, as I think everyone on the call is where we saw, a pull forward of that significantly back into June. So, it was really just a shift as we saw some of those categories move into the back half of June, and I'll let Richard expand a little bit further.\nRichard McPhail: Yes. And Brian, Billy's comments were spot on. There were signs of maybe a little more general weakness. The major driver were those heat-related categories. There were some signs of more general weakness. That had an influence on our guidance range. But let's just -- let's talk about that range and kind of how we've started off the quarter. August has started off at a level consistent with what we would expect in a negative 3% comp result for the year. And August comps are better than July, right? And so, we -- there are a lot of factors that went into our guidance. But again, August has started off at a level consistent with what we'd expect in the negative 3% comp case.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And the second question I have, I guess, the bigger picture. But when we're talking a lot about SRS, the acquisition now is closed. You're working on the integration. Because we're watching Home Depot, this continued push into the professional market, I mean should we be expecting you to be exploring other acquisition opportunities there?\nTed Decker: Well, Brian, as I said, SRS will continue their activity to fill in geographies and segments, et cetera. Look, we just made a very large acquisition that we feel great about in early, early days of joint business planning and value creation. We've always talked about utilizing M&A for growth opportunities, whether it's segments or geographies or customer bases. And expect us to continue to do that, but do not expect us to do anything large having just done this very significant transaction with SRS.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: It sounds like the Pro spread widened versus DIY relative to Q1. Curious, if there's any call out there? And then you mentioned positive comps for Pro's engaging in your new ecosystem. I'm curious what percent of Pro's this now represents and how you'd expect this trajectory to trend now that SRS is under your belt?\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Yes, Zach it's Ann-Marie. Pro certainly outperformed due to selfers in the quarter. And as we have mentioned, we continue to invest in the Pro ecosystem to accelerate growth and really drive and grow the share of wallet. I'll go it over to Chip and just speak a little bit about the investments and what we're seeing there.\nChip Devine: Yes. Thanks, Zach. As we've mentioned in the past, we're investing in markets. In last year, we had 14 markets we invested in. We'll be fully invested in 17 markets this year. And when we talk about investing in markets, it's a distribution supply chain capability play, foundational capabilities that help us better serve the Pro and then most importantly, our expansion of our outside sales team. We've seen positive growth in all of those markets since we've been investing. And we see that quarter after quarter. So, we're very, very pleased with our progress over the last 1.5 years as we've marched and we continue to march in '25 with the same progress and expectation of expansion.\nZach Fadem: Got you. And then, Richard, two quick ones. First on buybacks and how we should think about the time line around the return? And then second, on the long-term structural margins. You gave some good detail around the impact of SRS. Curious how we should think about the new high watermark in recovery over time?\nRichard McPhail: Well, let's talk about share repurchases. So, as we announced, as part of the SRS acquisition, we financed the acquisition with $10 billion in bond issuances and then some short-term commercial paper raising. We are currently at a 2.6x debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We like to see that ratio around 2.0x. It's our intent to delever over time before we restart repurchases. That's going to take us likely into the year 2026, and we will obviously update our investors on how that looks over time. But that would be the kind of the current calculation, sometime in 2026, we have returned. And then from a long-term structural perspective, when we laid out our basin in an accelerated case, we said to the base case. Look, we anticipate, in the base case, that we will always generate some degree of operating leverage. And that will always remain true. We're not going to talk about a high watermark. And we will continue to update you on our views. But for now, we're executing with exceptional expense management, exceptional measurement and cost of goods sold. And we are delivering -- over delivering really on the profitability we would have expected at this top line rate. So, we are happy that we're running the business as it should be run. And we believe that in those base case and accelerated cases that we laid out in June.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Maybe just a quick follow-up on SRS. Ted, you mentioned the growth right and broke it down 50-50 between comp. And I think you said lapping acquisitions. So maybe just give us an update on where the branch count is today? And then, how would you sort of summarize the capital spending needs of that business to fund both greenfield and acquisition-related expansion as it included in the CapEx guidance?\nTed Decker: Sure. The good news is on their greenfield operations, it's reasonably capital light, at least a more modest-sized facility than a Home Depot DC would be, think of this as a branch operation. And high turning inventory and variable pay for the sales force. So, they tend to be breakeven in year one of operation. Similarly, when they make infill acquisitions, they have a great process to get that acquisition up on their ERP system. They literally do it over the weekend. They acquire a company on a Friday, and when that company opens up on a Monday, they are on the core ERP system of SRS. And that lets them get the operating process and technology synergies very quickly. And they have a track record of doubling EBITDA of acquired companies in the first three years of ownership. So, it's reasonably asset-light. It's quickly profitable on a greenfield basis, and it's multiples of earnings expansion on an acquired company. Since owned them, they've made -- in fact, I think last Friday, they closed on a small pool deal. They have a couple more under LOIs. So, these are modest infill acquisitions that they do in the normal course of business. So, we're really excited to watch them grow. And again, it's reasonably asset light on greenfield in the multiples, they're paying, as you can imagine, on smaller regional companies that are generally in single-digit EBITDA multiple. So nice earnings profile on their acquisition case.\nSteven Forbes: And Richard, maybe just a very quick follow-up as we think about sort of restating last year's numbers for intangible amortization. The full year amount for last year, we're looking at 15 basis points as a percentage of sales? Or maybe correct me if I'm off there.\nRichard McPhail: Yes. The total amortization expense last year was $186 million for Home Depot for the full year of 2023.\nTed Decker: And Steve, on branches, they're about 775. So, when we announced in March, it was 760, you can see their growth profile. They've opened 20-plus branches just in the last few months. So, these folks are super growth oriented.\nOperator: Thank you. Ms. Janci, I will now turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call in November.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's first quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors and as a reminder please limit yourself to one question with one follow up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Decker: Thank you, Isabel, and good morning everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $36.4 billion, down 2.3% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 2.8% from the same period last year and our U.S. stores had negative comps of 3.2%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.63 in the first quarter compared to $3.82 in the first quarter last year. The team executed a high level in the quarter, continued to grow market share. While the quarter was impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects, we feel great about our store readiness, product assortment and associate engagement. Our associates are energized and ready to serve our customers as spring breaks across the country. As you will hear from Billy, where weather was favorable, we saw good customer engagement and strength in outdoor projects. In addition, our focus remains on creating the best interconnected experience growing Pro wallet share with a differentiated set of capabilities in building new stores, driving sales growth with our Pro customers remains one of our top focus areas. Remember, we operate in a $45 trillion asset class, which represents the installed base of homes in the United States and we serve a highly fragmented addressable market of approximately $1 trillion. Within that TAM, the greatest opportunity is with the residential Pro contractor, who shops across many categories of home improvement products while working on complex projects. We've defined that specific opportunity as an approximately $250 billion TAM, of which we have relatively little share today. We also know that to effectively serve this TAM, we need an expanded set of capabilities and services that we refer to as our Pro ecosystem. And while the store remains the center of that ecosystem, we are developing more fulfillment options, a dedicated sales force, specific digital assets, trade credit and order management capabilities geared at the residential Pro who shops across categories. As we've shared with you before, our more mature markets with this Pro ecosystem have seen great success, so we're expanding to other markets. As you heard last quarter, we'll have the foundational elements of our ecosystem in 17 markets by the end of the fiscal year. And while these 17 markets are currently at different maturity levels, they are outperforming our other large Pro markets in aggregate. Earlier this quarter, we announced our intent to acquire SRS, a residential, specialty trade distributor with a leading position in three large, highly fragmented specialty trade verticals serving the roofer, the pool contractor and the landscape professional. SRS is complementary to the ecosystem we've been building, giving us another avenue to more effectively serve the complex project occasion. They also give us the right to win with a specialty trade Pro customer. SRS does an exceptional job serving the specialty trade Pro who typically only shops one category and needs specialized capabilities to complete their project. In addition, SRS is an exceptionally well run business with a world-class management team. As we build out our own ecosystem, we can leverage their expertise in deep product catalog in the verticals in which they operate. We have significant growth opportunities in front of us and we are very happy with the operational execution in our core business. And despite pressure in the market, we continue to invest in our business. We are gaining share of wallet with our customers whether they are shopping in our stores, on our digital assets, or through our Pro ecosystem. Our merchants, store and MET teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams are always ready to serve in any environment. They did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter and I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. With that, let me turn the call over to Ann.\nAnn-Marie Campbell: Thanks, Ted, and good morning everyone. As we head into a bigger selling season, our associates continue to be engaged, excited and ready to serve our customers. As Ted mentioned, growing share of wallet with the Pro and winning the Pros working on complex projects continues to be our largest growth opportunity. We know that delivering the best shopping experience for any purchase occasion is critical to our success. That is why we continue to invest in our Pro sales teams and capabilities. We have developed new capabilities within our Pro Intelligence tool which feeds our CRM platform and leverages data science to bring better insight to our sales teams. These tools are helping us to both assist in identifying the optimal Pro targets in a market as well as the highest value cross-selling opportunities to drive action and sales. Another critical component of the shopping experience is being in stock with the right products and ensuring those products are on shelf and available for sale. We've talked to you before about SideKick and Computer Vision and are thrilled with the results we've seen so far. This year, we will continue to lean in to improve our OSA and drive productivity by creating consistent, actionable and directed task for our associates. What's really exciting is how we are also now leveraging Computer Vision for other applications across the store. For example, Computer Vision helps us maintain the integrity of our base by ensuring that the products on the shelf meets all quality standards. Maintaining high-quality damage-free product is a key component of delivery on the customer experience. Additionally, we have also deployed this technology in our self-checkout corral [indiscernible] to help us mitigate shrink. Computer Vision can identify complex carts or high-value carts and signal the cashier to help the customer with their basket to ensure all products are scanned and accounted for. While we will continue to improve upon all of these technology-enabled applications, we are thrilled with the early results we are seeing. Last quarter, we talked with you about one of our areas of opportunity within our post-sale experience, specifically within our returns process. I am excited to update you that over 70% of online orders are now able to be self-service returned from their MyAccount profile on our website. Now our customers can create their own return of an online order and drop it off at UPS with a scan of a barcode. Later this year, we will enable job site pickup or returns back to our FDC, which will be a game changer for Pro shopping experience. This enhancement will allow our customers primarily the residential pro to initiate a return from their job site versus having to return big and bulky items to the store. This is a massive win, not only for pros, but also for associates and/or stores and will drive better customer satisfaction and greater store productivity. These initiatives are just a few examples of the different ways we are improving the shopping experience for customers and/or associates. I am so excited about all we are doing to drive sales in our stores, and I look forward to the opportunity that's ahead of us. None of this would be possible without our amazing associates and I want to thank them for all they do to take care of our customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\nBilly Bastek: Thank you, Ann. And good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the first quarter, our sales were impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger, discretionary projects. However, where weather was favorable, we saw good customer engagement and strength in outdoor projects. Before providing commentary on our comp performance, it's important to note that we made some merchandising department changes to more closely reflect how our customers shop our categories and better align with our merchandising growth efforts. We now have 16 departments, up from 14 previously and have separated electrical and lighting; and kitchen and bath. Additionally, we have renamed our tools department to power and included outdoor power equipment to capture synergies and maximize the strength of our battery-powered platforms. Turning to our department comp performance for the first quarter, our building materials and power departments posted positive comps, while outdoor garden, paint, lumber, plumbing and hardware were all above the company average. During the first quarter, our comp transactions decreased 1.5% and comp average ticket decreased 1.3%. However, we continue to see our customers trading up for new and innovative products. Big ticket count transactions or those over $1,000 were down 6.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. We continue to see softer engagement in larger discretionary \u2013 projects where customers typically use financing to fund the projects such as kitchen and bath remodels. Turning to total company online sales, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased 3.3% compared to the first quarter of last year. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the first quarter nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores. We are incredibly focused on removing friction for our customers to create an excellent, interconnected shopping experience. We continue to work on improving our online search functionality and serving the most relevant product offerings to our customers. To do this, we rolled out an intent-based search engine that combines keywords, behaviors and intent to deliver more targeted results. And we enhanced our filtering capabilities, improving the customers\u2019 ability to find exactly what they are looking for. All of these initiatives work together to drive strong results in our online business. Pro and DIY customers\u2019 performance was relatively in line with one another, but both were negative for the quarter. While Pro backlogs remain relatively stable, we hear from our Pros that homeowners continue to take on smaller projects. The investments we are making are resonating with our Pros as we see increased engagement. For example, we have made significant progress with the Pro Paint [ph] and continue to see share gains with this customer. Our partnerships with Bayer and PPG as well as enhanced capabilities around their in-store service and job site delivery capabilities are helping to remove friction from their experience. During the end of the first quarter, we hosted our annual Spring Black Friday and Spring Gift Center events and saw strong performance across both events. Our merchants did a fantastic job curating the best products and we saw strong engagement with our customers throughout the events. We are pleased with the results we saw, particularly in categories like riding lawnmowers and outdoor power equipment, where we had experienced some discretionary pull forward over the last couple of years. The trend away from gas to battery-powered products is continuing, and we are well positioned with our assortment. We have the brands our customers are looking for, whether it's RYOBI, Milwaukee, DEWALT, Makita or RIDGID. We estimate that there are nearly 500 million batteries in the market today, and our assortment covers the vast majority of these batteries. In fact, more than 70% of batteries with brands that are exclusive to The Home Depot in the big box channel with hundreds of products across each of these platforms, this is one of the best loyalty programs that keeps customers coming back to The Home Depot. And our live goods category looks incredible. We are ready for spring with everything from shrubs to a variety of flowers, herbs and vegetables for every type of gardener. We're excited about spring breaking across the country, and we remain ready to help our customers with all of their outdoor projects and outdoor living needs. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, total sales were $36.4 billion, a decrease of approximately 2.3% from last year. During the first quarter, our total company comps were negative 2.8% with comps of negative 4% in February, negative 0.8% in March, and negative 3.3% in April. Comps in the U.S. were negative 3.2% for the quarter with comps of negative 4.8% in February, negative 1.3% in March, and negative 3.6% in April. For the quarter, Mexico posted positive comps, whereas Canada was slightly below the company average. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.1%, an increase of approximately 45 basis points from the first quarter last year, primarily driven by benefits from lower transportation cost and shrink. During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 140 basis points to 20.2% compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a benefit from a legal settlement that we are overlapping from the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as deleverage from our top line results. Our operating expense performance was in line with our expectations. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 13.9% compared to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2023. Interest and other expense for the first quarter decreased by $13 million to $428 million. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 22.6% compared to 24.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $3.63, a decrease of 5% compared to the first quarter of 2023. During the first quarter, we opened two new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,337. Retail selling square footage was approximately 242 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $22.4 billion, down approximately $3 billion, or 12% compared to the first quarter of 2023, and inventory turns were 4.5x, up from 3.9x last year. Turning to capital allocation. During the first quarter, we invested approximately $850 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders and we returned approximately $600 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As a reminder, in March we announced our intent to acquire SRS Distribution and as a result, we paused share repurchases. As you've heard us say many times, we maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation and that is not changing. First and foremost, we will invest in the business and expect capital expenditures of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. After investing in the business, we plan to pay the dividend and it is our intent to return any excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. From time to time, we will also invest in the business through acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and to accelerate our strategic objectives. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 37.1%, down from 43.6% \u2013 excuse me, down from 43.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Now, I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2024. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, our guidance does not currently reflect any impact from the announced acquisition of SRS. The acquisition is currently under regulatory review and we expect it to close by the end of fiscal 2024. We expect total sales growth to outpace sales comp with sales growth of approximately positive 1% and comp sales of approximately negative 1%. Total sales growth will benefit from a 53rd week and we expect the 53rd week will contribute approximately $2.3 billion in sales. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.9%, an increase of approximately 50 basis points, compared to fiscal 2023. We expect operating margin of approximately 14.1%. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion, and our diluted earnings per share percent growth is targeted to be approximately 1% compared to fiscal 2023. It\u2019s our intent to update guidance as appropriate once the SRS transaction closes. We believe that we have positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment. The investments we\u2019ve made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model. As we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen our position with our customers, leverage our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Can you talk about how the \u2013 how you think the bathtub effect could play out? Do you have a sense of how much maybe the weather was a net headwind year-over-year, understanding that last spring was also wonky? And related to that, Billy mentioned being pleased with spring where the weather was good and some positive commentary and some early COVID-winning categories. So where there was normal weather? Did you see comps maybe get flat or even \u2013 or maybe up around the spring business? Thanks.\nTed Decker: Hey, good morning, Chris, wonky is a great word to describe this spring. We can\u2019t really point to one geography that has had consistently good weather. But yes, certain markets, particularly in some of the Northern most markets where we\u2019ve had some good weekends, business was just incredible. And that\u2019s really what powered the positive comp in our power business. A lot of that is driven by outdoor power equipment. We talk a lot about the battery platforms and the brands we have and customers are really responding to that category. But we just haven\u2019t had the consistent weather across the country. We were looking for much improved Western division this year given how bad weather was last year in the West, but that really didn\u2019t happen. So the bathtub is in effect but we still have a long way to go. Our biggest selling weeks are ahead of us and certainly hope for some drier weather in sunnier days. But Billy, maybe you can add some commentary.\nBilly Bastek: Yes. No, thanks for the question, Chris. And as Ted mentioned, I mean, if you go back and we knew that there was pull forward in a lot of discretionary categories, single item purchases, if you will. And we\u2019re really pleased to see some of those businesses more normalize to the cyclical cycle of what you would typically see. And there\u2019s no question that that, that was \u2013 had been an impact certainly last year and so really pleased with seeing some of that. Yes, where the weather has been great, which hasn\u2019t been or consistent, I should say, we\u2019ve seen great customer engagement. I mentioned our Spring Black Friday event, our spring gift center events. We\u2019ve seen great consumer customer engagement there. And there\u2019s still the continued pressure that we see in finance big projects as they called out in kitchen and bath, specifically in the kind of remodeling finance projects, but really pleased with some of the customer engagement, some of those pull-forward categories so far.\nChris Horvers: And just to dig in on that a little bit on the big ticket sort of two sides of the coin, is the big ticket finance project business did it get worse because rates spiked in on the other side, categories like garden equipment and grills and patio, are you seeing any emergence of replacement cycle where you could see maybe those categories start to get back to flat, if not up?\nRichard McPhail: Chris, this is Richard. So just from a year-over-year perspective, we saw big ticket pressure last Q1, which was more of the item purchase as customers deferred those sort of item purchases. We saw big ticket pressure this Q1 as well and yet the dynamic has changed and the dynamic really that we began to see towards the back half of last year was this deferral of large projects like Billy called out. So the pressure in those categories has actually increased. It's a different story of Q1 2023 versus 2024. And maybe, Bill, you talked about particular categories.\nBilly Bastek: Yes. Again, the kitchen and bath remodel project cabinets and so forth. I mean, anything that's financed, we continue to see even a little bit more pressure. Conversely, and you just mentioned, Chris, some of the categories more item buying. I mean, the category like riding mower is well over $1,000 purchase, and we're seeing just in a few categories like that, terrific customer engagement. Again, we had pulled forward, but we're really pleased with some of those specific item purchases even the ones that are over $1,000, as I mentioned, riding mowers and some other categories where we've seen really back to that cyclical customer engagement. We're really pleased with some of those pieces that we're seeing in the business.\nChris Horvers: Thanks very much. Have a great rest of spring.\nTed Decker: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi, good morning, everyone. My first is a macro, and I'm going to follow-up with a micro. I want to ask your opinion on lock-in effect versus turnover. If it's clear that we need turnover now for stronger demand? And if you can talk about demand in regions of the country where pricing is more noticeably going up than others seeing if there is a real lock-in effect that can happen. And the contingency is if we don't get rate decreases, what sort of normal could look like?\nRichard McPhail: So Simeon, I think you have to think about this short-term and longer term. So if we think about lock-in effect and the impact of housing turnover. Clearly, we've seen two years of significant decrease in housing turnover to the point where we're at really sort of at historical lows. And most folks think that, that can't get much lower. When you're thinking about current performance, obviously, that puts pressure on our business. When a customer buys or sells a home, they spend more in that year than in a year when they don't. And so there's no doubt that we're missing some of that project demand, and that's what's going on our sales as we had anticipated. Then you have to ask yourself though, the lock-in effect, the interest rate environment, at this point, a lot of subject to the macro. I think the question is at what point current interest rates become sort of the new normal. This is not something that we're making a prediction on. It's just thinking about behavior. At some point, spend on housing shifts from discretionary to something that you simply must do. We know that there's pent-up demand for household formation. And so again, I'd say short-term, it is having an impact on our customers' mindset. And it's not just housing turnover related spend. It's really all large projects. As Billy said, sort of debt finance spend where we are seeing interest rates sort of weigh on the mind of customers. And look, we're not immune to this. If you look at the national figures on what's really driving the consumer right now, its services. Goods are underperforming services and durable goods are seeing the most pressure and in particular, home-related categories. So this is not a surprise and this is baked into our expectations for the year. The question will be how it evolves over time.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. That's helpful, Richard. My follow-up, transaction is still negative, but on a stack, it looks like they're getting a little better if we're not overreading it, and that's despite the spring weather, not breaking yet. So if you look at your transactions on an improving trend line, is that industry bottoming, getting better? Or is that Home Depot taking share?\nTed Decker: Well, those are challenging to tease out. I would say our sense is we are taking share. That's from third-party reporting on 4441, but transactions, I think you have two dynamics going on, and they relate to your prior question, Simeon. We've talked about the COVID and the lap of the COVID it is sort of like the giant storm and the hurricane. And for a couple of years, after you pulled so much demand forward, you suffer from lower sales in those categories. And that's what we were talking about last year and when Billy was just reviewing this item buying, there was no doubt, grills and riders and patio sets, these big-ticket items were pulled forward. We're seeing now that sort of naturally lap sort of like that hurricane effect lapping. What is newer, and we chatted about this before, is the housing turnover, which while historically not a huge driver of demand, it's steady state demand as housing turnover is fairly steady. But in the last 18-odd months is that has dropped from over 6 million units a year, I think at some run rates in certain months, it was even under 4 million, that dramatic decrease in housing activity is sort of the newer hurricane, if you will. And we don\u2019t see that going much lower. It\u2019s hard to predict, but as Richard said, tough to call the macro. But at some point, people will start to lap the interest rates and the lock-in effect. We\u2019ve already seen percentages of houses with mortgages and all the various interest rate strata the percentage that we\u2019re in that under 3.5% is past peak. So you\u2019re already starting to see a bit of an unlock there. But all of that then leads to your transaction question. So we are starting to see some increase in transaction as we\u2019re lapping more of the COVID pull forward, some newer pressure with the housing turnover dynamic. But net-net, we like the trend of transactions in units per basket were also up and we like seeing that trend as well. So not unexpected, as Richard said, and all baked into our guidance for 2024.\nRichard McPhail: And just to add to that, you think about how we\u2019re performing in spite of large projects, having seen the pressure, if you just look at debt financing and you look at some of the statistics around where we\u2019re sitting, HELOC withdrawals or HELOC borrowings down 23% year-over-year that\u2019s a Q4 statistic, but I think we\u2019re in the same territory in Q1. In dollars, that\u2019s dropping somewhere from $70 billion-ish a quarter to $50 billion-ish a quarter. And you look at cash out refinancing down 14% year-over-year, in dollars this peaked around $80 billion and they were $17 billion last quarter. And so you\u2019ve got a significant drop, more than 75% from peak to where we are today. And so that\u2019s to us interesting context for the fact that transactions have actually begun to recover on a sequential basis. So we\u2019re punching through the environment. But in some respects, as Ted said, the macro has been against us for a little while now. And you could almost say those statistics are stabilizing at least on the bottom.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Fadem: Hey good morning and thank you. I want to start with a clarification on the outlook. You\u2019ve got 1% EPS growth. I just want to confirm that this incorporates the buyback pause post Q1. And then second, transaction growth stepping in the right direction. Curious if this was more Pro or DIY driven or both? And any color on the health of small and midsized Pros versus larger Pros?\nRichard McPhail: Great. So Zach, I\u2019ll take the first part. It\u2019s Richard. So look, as we have reiterated guidance and see no reason to do anything about that. And when you think about the pause in share repurchases, think about the fact that we\u2019re also accumulating cash. As we accumulate cash, we earn interest on that cash. You\u2019ll see on our balance sheet, we have over $4 billion in cash right now, which is around $3 billion higher than last year. So given where short-term interest rates are, that interest income is a really strong offset to the impact from pause share repurchases and therefore, the net of it wouldn\u2019t change our guidance.\nTed Decker: And on the Pro/DIY, each were negative for the quarter, more or less the same rate. And within Pro, the larger Pro continues to outperform particularly those engaging in the ecosystem. I\u2019ll let Chip comment more about our performance there.\nChip Devine: Yes. Thanks, Zach, where we\u2019ve expanded our capabilities around our supply chain capabilities and the expansion of our outside sales teams, we\u2019ve seen noticeable outperformance in those markets and positive comps, so very pleased with that march of expansion. And as we move into this next nine months, we\u2019ll expand in another three FTC markets that we\u2019ve mentioned, one in LA, one in Detroit and one in San Antonio. So we\u2019re very pleased with our progress.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Appreciate the color. And then, Richard, quickly, it looks like your SG&A on a per store basis was about flat year-over-year when you exclude the legal impact. And I\u2019m curious if this is the right way to think about productivity this year or if you have any other levers at your disposal through the year.\nRichard McPhail: Well, look, again, I would encourage you to look at our full year guidance because operating expense management can vary quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we wanted to make sure that we were fully staffed in our stores. And as we said, we had a little bit later start to spring than we would have liked. And so \u2013 but we wanted to make sure that we were right there in front of our customer. We had other favorability. I mean, hats off to all our teams driving productivity throughout the portfolio, but in that particular point, operating expense is controlled by our operations team, just did a fantastic job landing [ph] quarter. And that's all baked into the reaffirmation of guidance.\nZach Fadem: Thanks so much for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning guys. The scope of the answer here might be a little beyond this conversation. But in general, can you talk about how you plan to utilize SRS and their discrete set of Pro relationships to potentially leverage your broader complex Pro initiatives?\nTed Decker: Sure, Scott. First and foremost, SRS is just a great company operating in three large, highly fragmented markets. So we talked about our TAM being $950 billion at the investor conference. With SRS in their market of roofing, specialty trade, pool and landscape that opens up $50 billion increased TAM were they are a strong number two in each of those segments. So just a well-run company in three great growth markets where they have strong share positions. So first and foremost, you get capability that lets you engage and win in a completely new TAM. How it's complementary to what we're doing, all the things that we are building, they have as a distributor. We've been a retailer for 45 years and we're building wholesale capability, things like trade credit, things like much more robust on time and complete delivery to job sites, things like order management, things like incentivized field sales forces. So these are all things that they've done for years, and we look forward to being able to engage with them and learn from them. But then they can also serve our customers. I mean our customers will benefit from their deep broad catalogs in those verticals, and we can cross-sell their product into our residential focused pro customer. So we look at this as just a great opportunity to expand market, to expand capabilities and to better service our customers.\nScot Ciccarelli: Very helpful. And then just, hopefully, a quickie. You talked about being in 17 markets by end of the year for the complex Pro capabilities. How many markets do you ultimately see that capability rolled out to its 17 going to x.\nTed Decker: I mean, we would expect to over time to be in we often talk about the top 40, kind of 80-20 rule of demand in our space, and that would be the expectation.\nScot Ciccarelli: Awesome. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. In light of the start to the year, have you \u2013 did you give any internal discussions to moderating your expectation around the way the rest of the year could unfold especially in light of what's likely to be now fewer rate cuts than was expected 90 days ago, which may mean that the overall rate of home improvement, the market may see less of an acceleration from here?\nTed Decker: Yes, Michael, we're not fed watchers here necessarily. And we said at the beginning of this year that we had a neutral stance on housing. We weren't going to take a bet on cuts or how many cuts. And that hasn't changed. What we are focused on and what our internal discussions do evolve around is our level of execution in the core business. And as I said, we couldn't be happier with how engaged this team is and how well we executed during the quarter. And if I can just take a minute to rattle off a few of these telltales, when you think what Hector has done in the stores, in terms of shrink, in leveraging our wage investments to getting attrition way down, which is helping with safety instances, what we're doing with technology and process in the store that Ann mentioned in her remarks about not just the better in-stock, but the supply chain is delivering, but the actual on-shelf availability that all our tools are delivering, our supply chain and merchant teams. What an incredible job in the face of negative comps, they took out $3 billion of inventory at cost, increased our turnover 60 basis points to 4.5 times and increased in-stock and on-shelf availability levels. I mean that is just incredible performance. And then add our price position. We talked about prices having settled in the marketplace. We're not any more promotional this year, but our overall price position with that roller coaster that we experienced during the COVID years, we're as well positioned on price and value and innovative products as we've been in some time. And then productivity in general remains a flywheel to Home Depot. And a lot of that SG&A leverage that you noticed, and we delivered was the efficiency in the model in having executed that $500 million in cost out that we signaled at the end of last year. So Michael, that\u2019s what we focus on internally is controlling what we can control, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m just so pleased with this team and their high level of execution in the quarter.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you for that, Ted. My follow-up is, there is a school of thought out there that the SRS acquisition could be assigned to Home Depot\u2019s efforts to address the complex Pro segment of the market has just proved to be a little bit more difficult than what was originally expected. How would you respond to that?\nTed Decker: Well, I\u2019d respond to say what we are doing to capture pro share of wallet with wholesale distribution capabilities is challenging, which is why no one's done it before. But we are doing it, and we are succeeding in it and we like what we see, and that\u2019s why we continue to roll out to additional markets. We also know it\u2019s a journey. This isn\u2019t open up a DC, building a physical DC is about the simplest thing for us to do in our whole ecosystem that we\u2019re building. But it is putting together all the pieces of the ecosystem and introducing our customers to those capabilities. And as we\u2019ve said before, as we introduce customers to the capabilities, it is a linear relationship between increased comp and increased engagement with those capabilities. So we\u2019re still optimistic in green and progressing on our organic efforts. SRS really is a completely different discussion in that a terrific asset and management team was brought to our attention that opened up a specialty distribution TAM that they have just a terrific position in. So at the end of the day, we keep reminding ourselves that we service a $45 trillion asset class with a $1 trillion TAM with the Home Depot at only about $150 billion in sales. We have so much share to gain with our consumers, in-store, online shopping with our existing Pros who largely shop our stores with this complex purchase occasion with larger Pros that we\u2019re building out the ecosystem. And now SRS gives us a whole new white space to go play in three other verticals to take even more share. So very, very different propositions.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much and good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Hey, good morning. Thanks a lot. Curious on the DIY side. Have you seen any changes in spending between income cohorts? And as a follow-up, you spoke to the delayed start to spring. Curious, a few weeks here into the month of May. Maybe you could frame out how business is tracking relative to the first quarter or April?\nRichard McPhail: So on the income cohorts, it\u2019s actually really more about project size than it is about income cohort right now. And as I said, the \u2013 as we said, the majority of the demand pressure is in those larger projects. And that really sort of spreads itself across cohorts, you could even say that, that almost tends to show as pressure in higher income cohorts. As we said before, though, this seems to be is it\u2019s not the inability to fund projects, it\u2019s a deferral mindset. You have this odd irony of every sound bite you read. Well, interest rates are going \u2013 they\u2019re coming down soon. Our customers tell us, hey, with that in mind, with that on the horizon, we\u2019re just going to wait and so that\u2019s really the most important dynamic from an income perspective.\nBilly Bastek: Yes. And then, Chuck, just on the first couple of weeks of May. I mean, it really has been the same story where weather has been favorable. We\u2019ve seen great customer engagement strengthen outdoor projects, really pleased with what we\u2019ve seen for the weather has been favorable, which is my prepared remarks, the same kind of dynamic we saw through, especially later in the quarter as the weather got a little bit better in certain parts of the country.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Thanks very much. And then, Richard, one for you. Just you spoke to confirming the 33.9% gross margin rate for the year. Is there anything today that makes you feel better or maybe worse about the underlying assumptions that got you there 90 days ago in terms of shrink, transportation mix?\nRichard McPhail: I think, we\u2019re \u2013 so we\u2019re executing on all cylinders. And from a transportation perspective, from the merchants managing retail and costs through one of the most volatile periods last year in our history, fantastic results. And then just to add to it, look, with respect to shrink, shrink is a problem for retail, organized retail crime is not going away it\u2019s a problem for all of us. The external environment is only getting tougher. As a result, we've done a tremendous amount of work. It is amazing, the effort put forth by our teams in making investments that pay off with significant return on investment and so when we look at our shrink performance, I hate to say this, but the external environment is not helping. Our teams are succeeding in blunting the impact. It's still a problem, it's still a pressure in our P&L. We want to keep attacking it, but we know that we've got the best in the business facing it. And it's not only a return on investment in terms of financial performance, it's a return on investment from a customer and associate safety perspective and so we're really happy about that. I think that there's one dynamic, you asked about margin. There's a dynamic here that I think it's worth calling out when you think about the shape of the year, and so I'll just go there. It is not insignificant when you think about the price dynamic last year, and how we saw retail settle in the market during the first half of 2023 and then essentially become what we would call settled during the second half of 2023, which has continued into Q1 and Q2 of this year. So when you think about the AUR pressure within ticket, we reported ticket in spite of AUR pressure that is in essence about 2 percentage points this quarter year-over-year. And what I want to remind you of is that's a year-over-year comparison. So we had kind of the height of well, let's put it in a different way. We had a lot of retail and cost settling during the first half of the year. So that 2% pressure is an artifact of a year-over-year measurement. It is not an observation on where \u2013 what prices are doing today, and they're relatively steady. As we move through the year, that pressure have from Q1 to Q2, so you'll have about 1 percentage point of pressure in Q2, it'll have again in Q3 and then in essence, be going in Q4. So you asked the question about margin. I think that is a point with respect to shape of the year that is important to put out there.\nChuck Grom: Great. Thanks very much Richard.\nRichard McPhail: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Zaccone: Hey. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I want to follow-up on Michael Lasser's question. Can you just help us understand what drives the second half improvement in same-store sales, just given the fact that the first half has been a little bit softer here with this delayed start to spring?\nRichard McPhail: Well, the primary factor is actually AUR, which we just outlined. So if you think about pressure going from the beginning of the year in Q1 of 2 percentage points to sort of falling to zero by the end of the year. That's really the majority of the arithmetic with respect to the year.\nSteven Zaccone: Okay. And then to follow-up on gross margin, maybe it's a question for Billy. Spring Black Friday did well. We did notice there was a new spring sale from an online-only competitor. Do you think the promotional environment is changing at all, I guess, especially on the DIY side of the business as you try to compete for that customer?\nBilly Bastek: Yes. So I'll speak to the promotional piece and thanks for the question. Listen, it's \u2013 we're in a very rational market and it's important to note that when we do events, we do events to drive excitement, to drive foot traffic in certain times of the year, no different than most folks do a Black Friday event, but we're doing that to drive excitement, bring value to the marketplace. We're not putting stuff, pulsing stuff on sale. The promotional business as it stands today in 2024 looks exactly like it did pre-COVID and before. It's no different. In fact, we've talked about appliances a little bit, but the environment really is normalized to what it was pre-COVID and I think it's, again important to note that we do that to drive excitement footsteps and absolutely try to bring value to our customers at these key times of the selling year.\nSteven Zaccone: Okay. Thanks Billy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my first question, and I apologize. I know this is going to be a bit repetitive to at least a couple of the prior questions. But so I maybe ask it a little bit different way. As you look at \u2013 today, you reiterated guidance for 2024. As you think about what we see would transpire, so to say in Q1. We talked a lot through the call about the macro pressures. The macro disruption is still impacting Home Depot. So the question I have is to get to that guidance, the guidance you've reiterated today, do you need some type of change, some type of solidification in the macro environment from what you're seeing today?\nRichard McPhail: This no, Brian. Really, the only impact here was a delayed spring and we manage this business in halves and no matter when spring comes it always comes and it never impacts our annual results or guidance. So that's why we reaffirm today.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. That's helpful. Then my second question, look, this with some of the macro data and there's more chatter out there about a potential reemergence, if you will, of inflationary pressures. So, I guess the question for you is, I mean, within your business, particularly maybe more the commodity side of this, are you starting to see this, a? And then, b, as you think about to the extent that we are seeing some type \u2013 potentially some type of reemergence of inflation. How do you view at this juncture, the ability of Home Depot to pass those type of costs along to consumers as it has in the past.\nRichard McPhail: If you look at the national statistics, and you actually parse inflation, inflation is being driven in the good space \u2013 sorry, the services space, not in the good space and particularly not in home-related categories, Billy, maybe just talk about observations.\nBilly Bastek: Yes. And from a commodity standpoint, Brian, we've seen no impact. Obviously, we talked a lot in the last year about not only lumber, but copper, and we're pleased with the fact that there's no impact on commodities at this point and see a very stable environment.\nBrian Nagel: Good. Very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nIsabel Janci: Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning everyone. I was hoping maybe to just expand on the weakness in certain discretionary projects such as kitchen and bath, any way to help us better understand if there's line of sight to stabilization in the project size headwind this year and/or pressure rolling off, meaning is it cycling compares still? Or are you still seeing project size moderate, right, relative to some baseline, whether it's a year ago or sort of from peak levels?\nTed Decker: Yes. It's \u2013 I mean, for sure, the single biggest pressure outside of the AUR that Richard went through was from discretionary larger decor-oriented projects. And as we've said last year, it was more of an item story. This year, it's more of a discretionary generally finance story. If you take something like kitchen cabinets in countertops, I mean those are probably the only categories where we've seen not just some falloff in projects and size of projects, but actually a little bit of trading down. So it's focused on those categories. That's the only place we've seen it and are seeing it. That too will pass. I mean I think that is now going through. There's \u2013 we've always had the idea that if turnover would drop, people would improve in place. I think we're still seeing the fallout from the turnover being down so dramatically. I mean it was just six months ago that interest rates hit their peak in October of 2023 mortgage rates. So those are the type of projects when you move into a new house, you update your kitchen; you update a master bathroom, et cetera. And then if you are going to stay in place, and take on those type of projects outside of a move, you're generally going to finance. And as we've seen the rates tick up and the impact of rates ticking up, that's impacting that demand. So right now, you would see a lap of that dynamic. We don't see housing turnover going lower. And then the question is interest rates, what does happen to interest rates in higher for longer, what does that mean you guys know as much as we do on that score?\nSteven Forbes: And then maybe just a quick follow-up. I think it was Chip's comments earlier about the Pro comp, right, being positive. I believe you said within those markets that are servicing the Complex Pro, so maybe just clarifying if that's what he said. And does that imply that you've seen a widening in the performance gap between those markets where you're servicing the complex Pro versus the company average? Maybe relative to what you guys stated at the Analyst Day last year?\nBilly Bastek: Yes. Just reaffirming what I said, we have seen positive comps in those markets where we've invested in sales professionals and our FTC markets.\nSteven Forbes: Great. Thank you.\nBilly Bastek: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Ms. Janci, I would now like to hand the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nIsabel Janci: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in August.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."}]}
