The Home Depot's earnings transcript revealed a company that outperformed market expectations in Q4, with comp sales growing 3.9%. Management attributed success to effective merchandising strategies, customer service initiatives, and stabilization in the housing market. However, challenges remain, including a tough Q1 2011 comparison due to early spring sales in 2010. The impact of expired tax credits and the housing market's volatility also cloud short-term prospects. Share price should consolidate in the near term.
