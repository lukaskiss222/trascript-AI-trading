Home Depot's Q4 results reflected the impact of a challenging housing market. The company's decision to explore strategic alternatives for its HD Supply division, alongside continued investments in its retail business, signals management's attempt to unlock value. The stock is likely to face pressure in the short term due to the uncertain housing market and the HD Supply evaluation. The company's focus on improving retail operations and its commitment to returning value to shareholders offers some positive outlook.
