Strong Q3 results beats expectations, with positive comps driven by maintenance and repair and decor categories. The upcoming holiday season and continued housing market improvement are positive indicators. However, the impact of Hurricane Sandy creates uncertainty for Q4, making short-term sales predictions difficult. The management remains optimistic, but the storm's aftermath could affect the immediate stock performance. Overall, the company's efficient capital allocation, successful merchandising strategies, and interconnecting retail initiatives are positive indicators for the medium term.
