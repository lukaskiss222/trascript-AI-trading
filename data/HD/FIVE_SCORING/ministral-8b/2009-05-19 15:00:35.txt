Based on the earnings transcript, the short-term impact on The Home Depot's stock price is likely to be negative. The company reported a 9.7% decrease in sales and negative comps of 10.2% for the first quarter. Despite improvements in customer service and gross margin, the ongoing challenges in the home improvement market and the potential for further declines in comps due to accelerating foreclosures in certain regions are likely to weigh on the stock. Additionally, the company's guidance for the year and the second quarter is cautious, which may further dampen investor sentiment. Therefore, the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
