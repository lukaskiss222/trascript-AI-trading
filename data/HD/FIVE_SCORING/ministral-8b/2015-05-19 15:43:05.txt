**Analysis:**
The Home Depot's Q1 2015 earnings call highlighted strong performance across various categories, with a focus on outdoor and garden products, and a positive outlook for the year. The company reported a 6.1% increase in sales, with a 7.1% comp in U.S. stores. The management team attributed this growth to a more normal spring, strong events like Spring Black Friday, and growth in the Pro categories. They also mentioned the importance of their interconnected capabilities and the growth of their digital properties. The company's guidance for the year was raised due to the strong performance in the first quarter. The management team also addressed the impact of the West Coast port situation, which had some impact on in-stock rates but was mitigated by the supply-chain team's efforts.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term (1-2 weeks) due to the strong performance and positive outlook for the year. The company's focus on interconnected retail, continuous product innovation, and strong sales across various categories should continue to drive growth. The management team's optimistic outlook and the company's ability to manage challenges like the West Coast port situation should also be seen as positive for the stock.
