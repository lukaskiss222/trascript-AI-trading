2. **Operational Changes**: The company implemented various measures to ensure the safety of associates and customers, such as reduced store hours, customer traffic limitations, and the cancellation of events like Spring Black Friday.

3. **Cost Management**: The company incurred additional costs related to associate benefits and paid time off, totaling $850 million, but still managed to under-spend its expense plan by $120 million.

4. **Future Outlook**: The company suspended its fiscal 2020 guidance due to the high level of uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and customer demand.
