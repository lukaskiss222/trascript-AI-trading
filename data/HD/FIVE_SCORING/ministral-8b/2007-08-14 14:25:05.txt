### Analysis

The Home Depot's Q2 earnings call revealed a challenging market environment due to declining housing starts, existing home sales, and subprime mortgage issues. Despite these challenges, the company reported sales of $22.2 billion, a 1.8% decrease from last year, with negative same-store sales of 5.2%. However, there were some positive signs, such as improved comp transactions, market share gains in certain product categories, and a focus on cost-saving measures. The company also highlighted its plans to expand in international markets and invest in its stores and supply chain.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around the sale of HD Supply. However, the company's focus on cost-cutting, market share gains, and long-term investments suggests potential for long-term growth. The stock may experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term.
