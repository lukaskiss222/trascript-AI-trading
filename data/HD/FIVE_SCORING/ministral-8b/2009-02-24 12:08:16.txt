The Home Depot's Q4 and full-year results call revealed a challenging environment with sales declining and comp sales showing negative growth. The company's guidance for 2009 projects a further decline in sales and EPS, which is likely to put downward pressure on the stock in the short term. The company's focus on cost-cutting measures, strategic expansions, and diversification efforts is positive, but the uncertainty around the housing market and the credit markets will likely continue to weigh on the stock. Additionally, the company's strategic actions, such as the store rationalization and the expo businesses closure, will result in charges that will impact the stock price. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the challenging environment and the company's strategic actions.
