The Home Depot's earnings call revealed a mixed picture of performance and expectations. The company reported a positive 1.2% comp sales growth, with U.S. stores posting a negative 1.1% comp and international stores contributing a positive 2.3%. The diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.18, adjusted for unusual items to $0.24. Management highlighted improvements in several key markets, including Canada and Mexico, and mentioned ongoing efforts to improve customer service and market share. The company expects 2.5% sales growth and a 15% increase in earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010, with more momentum in the second half of the year. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
