### Analysis

The Home Depot's Q2 2011 earnings report shows a mixed picture. While the company reported strong sales and comps growth, particularly in outdoor and home improvement categories, there are several concerns that could impact the stock price in the short term. The company's guidance for the back half of the year was slightly reduced, and there are uncertainties around the housing market and GDP growth. Additionally, the company's cost-saving measures and ongoing diversification efforts are positive, but the stock may face pressure due to tempered guidance and defense market uncertainties.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
