**Analysis:**

The Home Depot's Q4 and full-year earnings call highlighted several key points that will likely impact the stock price in the short term. The company reported a 15% decline in earnings per share and a 6.7% decrease in comp sales, primarily driven by a challenging housing market and increased competition. Management acknowledged the difficulties but emphasized their focus on long-term initiatives such as improving product availability, enhancing customer service, and investing in new store standards. Additionally, the company provided a cautious outlook for 2008, expecting continued negative comps and a decline in EPS. The stock may face downward pressure due to these factors, but the long-term strategic focus could provide support in the future.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the company's challenging financial results and cautious outlook for 2008. The stock may rally if the housing market improves or if the company's strategic initiatives show significant progress in the coming quarters.
