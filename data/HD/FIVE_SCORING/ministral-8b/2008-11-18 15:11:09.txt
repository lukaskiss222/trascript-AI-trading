The company's average ticket was also down, with a significant decline in big-ticket sales. However, the company's gross margin improved, and it launched a new lower-priced campaign. The company's international businesses, particularly Canada, also faced economic pressures. The company's guidance for 2008 projects sales to be down as much as 8%, and earnings per share from continuing operations to be down approximately 24% from last year.
