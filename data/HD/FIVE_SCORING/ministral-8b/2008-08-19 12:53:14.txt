### Analysis

The Home Depot's Q2 earnings call revealed several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Sales and Comps**: The company reported a 5.4% decrease in sales and a 7.9% decrease in comps, which are disappointing figures. However, the management attributed some of this to the 53-week fiscal year and the economic stimulus package.

2. **Gross Margin and Operating Expenses**: The gross margin improved by nine basis points, and operating expenses increased by 188 basis points. The company expects modest improvement in comps for the remainder of the year, which could put pressure on the stock.

3. **Credit Agreement**: The company finalized a new credit agreement with Citi, which will reduce the volatility in their cost of credit. This is a positive development for the company's financial health.

4. **International Performance**: The company saw positive comp growth in Mexico, China, and Canada, which is encouraging.

5. **Seasonal Factors**: The company attributed some of the comp decline to seasonal factors, such as the 53-week fiscal year and the economic stimulus package. However, the management expects continued pressure in the markets due to the housing market and rising costs of goods.

### Conclusion

The overall tone of the call was cautious, with the company expecting continued pressure in the markets and modest improvement in comps for the remainder of the year. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the disappointing sales figures and the expectation of continued market pressure.
