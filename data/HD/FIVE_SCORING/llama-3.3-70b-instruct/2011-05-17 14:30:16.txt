The Home Depot's Q1 earnings report revealed mixed signals, with sales decreasing by 0.2% and comps declining by 0.6%, primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions. However, the company saw strength in non-seasonal categories, and its merchandising efforts drove positive growth in areas like kitchens, tools, and flooring. Management's guidance for 2.5% sales growth in 2011 remains unchanged, and they expect expenses to grow at approximately 60% of sales growth rate. Despite short-term headwinds, the company's long-term initiatives, such as improving customer service and driving value, are showing promise.
