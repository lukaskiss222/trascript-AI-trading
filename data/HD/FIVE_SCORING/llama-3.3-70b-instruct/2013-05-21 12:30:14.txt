The Home Depot's Q1 2013 earnings call revealed a strong performance, with sales increasing 7.4% year-over-year and diluted earnings per share rising 22.1%. The company's pro business segment showed significant growth, outpacing the consumer segment for the first time in several years. Management attributed this to the housing market recovery and their own efforts to improve service and product offerings for professional customers. Despite weather-related challenges in the first quarter, the company raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing a strong start to the second quarter and expectations of continued housing market improvement.
