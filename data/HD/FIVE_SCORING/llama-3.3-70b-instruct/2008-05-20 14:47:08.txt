The Home Depot's first-quarter earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with sales declining 3.4% and same-store sales declining 6.5%. However, the company's efforts to improve merchandising, customer service, and operational efficiency are showing promise. The closure of 15 underperforming stores and removal of 50 stores from the growth pipeline are expected to free up $1 billion in cash over the next three years, which will be invested in existing stores. Despite the challenging market conditions, the company's international businesses, particularly in Mexico and China, are performing well. The company's guidance for the year remains unchanged, with expected earnings per share down 24% from fiscal 2007.

Given the mixed results and the company's efforts to adapt to the challenging market conditions, I predict that the stock price will likely remain neutral in the short term, as the market digests the earnings report and the company's plans to improve its operations.
