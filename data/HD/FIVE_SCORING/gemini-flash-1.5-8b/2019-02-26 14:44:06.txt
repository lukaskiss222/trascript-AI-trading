The Home Depot's earnings call highlights strong fiscal 2018 performance, though Q4 comps were slightly below expectations due to unfavorable weather.  Management emphasizes the positive impact of investments in digital services and the Pro customer segment, while acknowledging some deflationary pressures on lumber prices.  The outlook for 2019 suggests continued growth, with a 5% comp sales forecast, and management expresses confidence in achieving their long-term targets.  This positive tone and reaffirmation of targets is likely to positively influence investor sentiment (albeit tempered by the Q4 weather-related issues) in the short term.
