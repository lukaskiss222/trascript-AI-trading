Home Depot's Q1 2024 earnings call indicates a continuation of soft demand, primarily due to delayed spring and the ongoing impact of higher interest rates on larger, discretionary projects.  Management focuses on positive trends in outdoor products, Pro customer engagement, and investments in the Pro ecosystem as potential drivers of future growth.  The company anticipates a more positive sales trajectory later in the year, as the spring selling season progresses.
