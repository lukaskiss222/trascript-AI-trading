The Home Depot's Q1 2021 earnings call shows strong performance exceeding expectations, driven by robust demand, particularly in lumber and related products.  Management attributes this to a combination of robust homeowner demand, healthy balance sheets, and the company's effective supply chain management.  While acknowledging inflation and supply chain disruptions, the company appears well-positioned to maintain high growth rates and potentially strong profitability throughout the year.
