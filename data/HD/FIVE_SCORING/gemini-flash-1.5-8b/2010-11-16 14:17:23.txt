Home Depot's Q3 2010 earnings call indicates a stabilizing business, with positive comps across most regions, particularly in central and mid-Atlantic areas, and Florida and California.  Management highlighted improved operational efficiency, the successful rollout of new technology (First Phone), and positive trends in smaller ticket items like maintenance and repair.  While the macro housing market remains pressured, the company is focusing on driving value and innovation across all customer segments to offset this.
