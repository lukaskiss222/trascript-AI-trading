Home Depot's Q3 2012 earnings call showed continued strength in the core business, with positive comps across most regions.  The significant impact of Hurricane Sandy is uncertain, but management anticipates a recovery similar to Hurricane Irene, although with potentially fewer stores affected.  The company is raising guidance for the year due to this strength and is projecting 18% EPS growth for 2012.
