Home Depot's Q1 2011 earnings showed a negative comp sales result primarily due to unseasonably cold and wet weather, particularly affecting the northern division.

While guidance for the year remained consistent, the weather-related impact will likely continue to drive discussion about the short-term outlook impacting investor sentiment.
