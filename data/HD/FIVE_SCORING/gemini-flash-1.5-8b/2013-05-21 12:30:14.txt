Home Depot's Q1 2013 earnings call highlighted strong performance, driven by increased sales, positive comps (particularly in the pro segment), and rising average ticket prices.  Management's optimistic tone and guidance upward for the year suggest a positive outlook.  The impact on the stock in the next 1-2 weeks should be positive due to the sustained growth and positive outlook, despite weather and seasonal factors.
