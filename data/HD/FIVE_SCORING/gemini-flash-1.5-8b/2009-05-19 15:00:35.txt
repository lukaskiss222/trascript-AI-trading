Home Depot's Q1 earnings reveal a challenging market, with sales down 9.7% and comps negative 10.2%.  While management notes some positive trends in individual markets and categories, and strong execution in reducing inventory, the overall picture points to a continued struggle, particularly in big-ticket items and the western US.  The company is holding to its guidance for further declines through the year.
