Home Depot's Q3 earnings call highlighted continued challenges, but also some signs of stabilization.  While sales declined, the company reported a positive sequential comp improvement in several key markets and a positive comp in paint.  Management's emphasis on operational efficiencies, supply chain improvements, and enhanced customer service, along with a possible bottoming of private fixed residential investment (PFRI), suggest possible positive near-term trends, although the pro business continues to struggle.  The stock's short-term outlook is likely neutral to slightly positive.
