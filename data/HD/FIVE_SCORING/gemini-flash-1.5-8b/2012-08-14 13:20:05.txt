The Home Depot's Q2 2012 earnings call indicates continued positive momentum, with comp sales exceeding expectations.  Management's commentary emphasizes stabilization in key markets and growth in core areas like kitchen installations. However, cautious guidance related to GDP forecasts and tough year-over-year comparisons suggest a more moderate pace of growth for the remainder of the year, despite impressive share buybacks.  This suggests the stock may see a short-term positive bump from the good news but without major catalyst, short-term movement may be subdued.
