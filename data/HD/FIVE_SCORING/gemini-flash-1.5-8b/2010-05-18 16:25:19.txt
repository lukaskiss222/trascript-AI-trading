The Home Depot's Q1 2010 earnings call showed strong positive comps, exceeding expectations.  Improved inventory management, better assortment, and strong performance in seasonal categories are key factors.  However, the call also highlighted persistent pressure on "big-ticket" items, impacting average ticket size, although the pro business showed some signs of improvement.  The company raised its guidance for the year, indicating confidence in future performance.
