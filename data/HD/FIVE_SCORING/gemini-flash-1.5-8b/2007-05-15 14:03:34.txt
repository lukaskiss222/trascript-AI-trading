Home Depot's Q1 earnings call paints a picture of short-term challenges with a surprisingly negative same-store sales performance (-7.6%).  While management emphasizes investments for long-term growth and improved associate engagement, the weak housing market and adverse weather significantly impacted sales, notably in key regions.  This suggests possible pressure on the stock price for the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the poor results and commentary on the continuing soft market.
