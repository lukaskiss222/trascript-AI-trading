Home Depot's earnings call highlights strong Q4 performance, exceeding expectations on key metrics like comp sales and EPS.  Management emphasizes continued strength in the pro customer segment and positive online sales growth.  While guidance for 2014 projects lower sales growth than 2013, the call suggests underlying strength, noting the potential for a continued housing recovery as a tailwind.  The company is optimistic about the upcoming spring selling season and strategic investments in interconnected retail.
