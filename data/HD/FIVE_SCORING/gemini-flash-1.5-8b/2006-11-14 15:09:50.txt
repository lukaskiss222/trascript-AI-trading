Home Depot's earnings call highlights a significantly slower-than-expected Q3, driven by a steeper-than-anticipated decline in the housing market.  Management anticipates continued pressure in Q4, though they see some improvement from the October slump.  The company is strategically focused on investments in stores, merchandising, and supply chain to better serve both retail and professional customers in the long run, even amidst short-term headwinds.
