Home Depot's earnings call highlights continued positive performance despite a challenging housing market.  Strong fourth-quarter sales, driven by  positive comps across most states and a significant uptick in big-ticket items, suggest a stabilizing business. Management's focus on customer service, supply chain improvements, and value-based promotions suggests continued positive trends.  The outlook for 2011 projects sustained growth, though with an anticipated headwind in the first quarter due to weather and difficult comparisons reflecting the timing of last year's spring.
