Home Depot's Q3 2014 earnings call highlighted strong performance across various metrics, including positive same-store sales growth, increased transactions, and higher average tickets.  Management reaffirmed guidance for the year, but noted that the recent data breach and unpredictable weather patterns in specific areas had influenced the results. The call was mostly positive, with analysts praising the company's interconnected retail strategy and growth in the Pro segment.  The company's strong results and positive outlook suggest a sustained positive stock price movement over the next couple of weeks.
