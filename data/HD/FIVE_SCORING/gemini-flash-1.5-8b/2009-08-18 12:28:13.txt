Home Depot's earnings call shows a resilience in the face of a challenging market.  While sales were down, positive comp transactions in the US (a first in over 5 years) and improvements in key markets like California and Florida highlight some positive operating momentum.  The companyâ€™s guidance upgrade and the focus on value and customer service suggest a strategic plan to weather the downturn, although uncertainties remain about the broader housing market recovery.
