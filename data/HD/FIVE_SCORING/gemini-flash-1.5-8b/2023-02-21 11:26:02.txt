Home Depot's earnings call highlights a shift from robust growth to moderation in 2023.  While record sales and earnings were achieved in 2022, management anticipates flat comp sales and a mid-single-digit decline in EPS for 2023.  This moderation is due to factors like easing, inflation, shifts in consumer spending, and potentially reduced demand for discretionary home improvements, making the near term outlook  slightly less positive than previously.
