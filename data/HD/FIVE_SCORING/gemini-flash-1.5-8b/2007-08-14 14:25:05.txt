Home Depot's earnings call highlights a challenging market for the home improvement sector, with housing starts and sales significantly down.  While the company's results were largely in line with expectations, with sales down 2% and comp sales down 5.2%, there were positive signs, such as improved transaction growth and market share gains in some categories (garden, flooring, paint).  The company is focused on long-term investments and expects continued difficulties in the second half of the year, which are likely to put short-term pressure on the stock price.
