Home Depot's Q1 2012 earnings exceeded expectations, driven by strong comp sales growth (6.1% for US stores) and favorable weather.  Management cited a pull-forward of demand due to warmer than expected weather, but expressed optimism about the underlying strength of the business.  The company is projecting further growth adjusted for these factors and raised guidance for 2012.
