Home Depot's earnings call paints a picture of continued pressure in the housing market.  While some positive trends exist in certain regions and departments, overall sales remain weak, driven by significant declines in big-ticket items and lower average spending per basket.  Management anticipates continued challenges into Q4 2008 and 2009, though they highlight operational improvements including inventory management and better execution.
