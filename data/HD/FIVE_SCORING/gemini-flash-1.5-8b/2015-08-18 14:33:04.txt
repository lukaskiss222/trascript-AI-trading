The Home Depot's Q2 2015 earnings transcript indicates strong performance exceeding expectations, driven by robust comp sales growth, particularly in the pro segment and big ticket items.  Management highlights successful strategies like expanding pro offerings and implementing new delivery systems (e.g., BOPUS and BOSS), along with a focus on innovation with new products (home automation), leading to increased customer satisfaction and higher average ticket sales.  The raised guidance for 2015 sales and EPS underscores the positive outlook and suggests a likely positive short-term impact on the stock price.
