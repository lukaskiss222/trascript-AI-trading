Home Depot's Q3 2013 earnings exceeded expectations, driven by strong comp sales (8.2% for U.S. stores), robust online sales (up over 50%), and consistent growth in both transactions and average ticket.  Management cited favorable housing market conditions and the ongoing strength of the professional segment as key drivers.  Positive guidance updates for 2013 sales and EPS suggest a continued upward trajectory for the stock over the next few weeks.
