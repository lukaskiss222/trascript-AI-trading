The Home Depot's Q3 2015 earnings call showed robust performance, with comp sales exceeding expectations and strong growth across both DIY and Pro segments.  Management highlighted continued strength in the Pro customer base, particularly in higher-ticket items, and positive trends in online sales.  The call also focused on the integration of the Interline Brands acquisition, and future strategies related to omnichannel fulfillment.  This suggests a positive outlook for the company in the short-term, with likely continued positive stock price movement.
