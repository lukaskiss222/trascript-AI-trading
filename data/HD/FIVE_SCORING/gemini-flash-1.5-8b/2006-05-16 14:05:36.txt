Home Depot's Q1 2006 earnings call highlighted strong growth in the Home Depot Supply segment, driven by the Hughes Supply acquisition.  The company also reported record sales and EPS growth, although retail sales were below expectations due to soft seasonal and flooring sales, partially attributed to weather. Management reaffirmed its guidance and emphasized future investments, particularly in e-commerce and store resets.  The short-term impact is likely to be positive, as the supply acquisition strengthens the company's overall performance, but potential concerns regarding anniversary effects on retail sales merit watching.
