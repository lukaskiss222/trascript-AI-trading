The Home Depot's Q2 2019 earnings call indicates continued strong performance, driven by positive U.S. comp sales growth despite lumber price deflation and a slowdown in the May/June period. Management highlighted successful investments in digital and physical store improvements, including streamlined checkouts, enhanced online experiences, and expanded tool rental services.  Lower lumber prices and recent tariff announcements lead to reduced sales guidance, but management believes the current consumer demand and investments remain strong to offset this and that the remaining comp sales growth is achievable.
