The Home Depot's earnings call highlights a cautious yet optimistic outlook for 2010.  While sales were flattish in Q4, management emphasizes improving trends in many U.S. markets, particularly in California and Florida, as well as strong gains in Canada.  Guidance calls for modest sales growth (2.5%) and EPS growth (15%), pointing to a likely gradual recovery, with improvement anticipated in the second half.  The company's focus on operational efficiency and customer service, along with investments in merchandising tools, suggests a positive impact on future earnings.
