Home Depot's Q1 2019 earnings call highlighted below-expectation sales due to February's adverse weather and significant lumber price deflation.  Management reaffirmed full-year guidance, citing the potential for stronger sales in the second half of the year, particularly with improved seasonal comparisons and strategic investments.  The company's focus on digital platforms, Pro customer relationships, and delivery capabilities suggests a bullish long-term outlook for profitability despite short-term uncertainties.
