The Home Depot reported a decline in both total and comparable sales, along with a decrease in earnings per share compared to the previous year. While the company highlighted improvements in gross margin and strategic initiatives like the Pro ecosystem and acquisition of SRS Distribution, the short-term outlook remains pressured by lower comparable sales and reduced guidance. These factors are likely to exert downward pressure on the stock in the near term.
