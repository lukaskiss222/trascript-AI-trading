The Home Depot reported strong Q4 results with a 13.9% sales increase and 7% comparable sales growth, exceeding expectations partly due to Hurricane Sandy-related sales. Managementâ€™s positive tone, increased dividends, and a significant share repurchase plan indicate confidence in continued growth, likely boosting investor sentiment in the short term.
