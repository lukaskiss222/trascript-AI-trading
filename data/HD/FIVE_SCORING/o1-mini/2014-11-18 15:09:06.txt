Home Depot reported strong third-quarter results with a 5.4% increase in sales and robust same-store growth of 5.2%, supported by significant online sales growth of nearly 40%. The reaffirmed guidance for fiscal year 2014, coupled with effective cost management and strategic expansions, reflects confidence from management and positive market sentiment. These factors are likely to drive a short-term rally in the stock.
