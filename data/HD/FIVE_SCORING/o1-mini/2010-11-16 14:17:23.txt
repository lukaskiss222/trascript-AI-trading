Home Depot reported solid Q3 results with a 1.4% sales increase and a 24.4% rise in earnings per share. Positive same-store sales for the fourth consecutive quarter, combined with strong guidance for the full year, indicate continued operational strength despite some challenges in the Canadian market. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock in the short term.
