The Home Depot reported a decline in sales and comparable sales for fiscal 2023, with EPS decreasing from $16.69 to $15.11. Despite these challenges, the company provided a stable outlook for 2024, highlighted strategic acquisitions, and announced a dividend increase, which may offer some investor reassurance. However, the immediate reaction is likely to be negative due to the recent sales and earnings declines.
