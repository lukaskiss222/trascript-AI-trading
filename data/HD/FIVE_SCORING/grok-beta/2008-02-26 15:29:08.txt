Despite Home Depot facing a challenging market with negative comp sales and anticipated EPS decline for 2008, several positive developments could potentially mitigate stock price drops in the short term. Strategic cost-saving measures, such as focusing more on key operational priorities and pausing the recapitalization plan, indicate prudent financial management to navigate the downturn. Improvements in merchandising, supply chain enhancements, and initiatives like "owning the pro" might signal to investors a long-term resilience strategy, possibly cushioning the stock from a more severe reaction. While the immediate future holds negative sales comparisons, these efforts could lead investors to look past current challenges, impacting the stock modestly.
