The Home Depot's Q1 earnings call showcased solid sales and earnings growth, largely attributed to unusually warm weather boosting demand. However, concerns arise from the pull-forward of sales into Q1 and the expectation of a lower comp in Q2, suggesting a potential slowdown in momentum. Additionally, while there are signs of recovery in the pro segment, growth is unevenly distributed, which could introduce volatility. Given the guidance for lower comps in the coming quarters, a short-term dip in stock price due to these tempered expectations seems likely.
