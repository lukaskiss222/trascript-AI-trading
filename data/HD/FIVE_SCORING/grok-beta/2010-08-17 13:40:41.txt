The Home Depot's Q2 2010 earnings call indicated several factors that will likely influence its stock price in the short-term:

1. **Mixed Performance**: While the company achieved positive sales growth, the guidance for a revised, lower sales outlook and tempered expectations for ticket growth imply potential pressure on the stock price. 
   
2. **Cost and Inventory Management**: Home Depot demonstrated strong inventory turnover and proactive cost-cutting measures, which are positive signals for profitability. 

3. **Ongoing Challenges**: Delays in pro segment recovery and cautious outlook due to broader economic factors (unemployment, housing market) might raise concerns among investors.

4. **Share Repurchasing**: The commitment to share repurchases using excess cash could bolster investor confidence and somewhat offset concerns about growth.

5. **Merchandising and Store Operations**: Focus on initiatives like customer service improvements, new product introductions, and merchandising efficiency could drive positive comps in specific categories, which is a positive sign.

Given these points, although the company has navigated challenges well, the cautious outlook and lower expectations for the housing market hint at potential short-term downward pressure on the stock.
