The Home Depot's Q4 earnings call disclosed several challenges impacting short-term stock performance. The company reported negative comp sales of 13%, revised down expectations for 2009 with a projected 9% decrease in sales and a 7% decline in EPS, and faced a difficult economic situation with weakened consumer demand, high unemployment, and deteriorating housing markets in key regions. Management's focus on cost control, inventory management, and customer service improvements might mitigate some of the negative effects but the overall guidance suggests considerable short-term downside risk for the stock.
