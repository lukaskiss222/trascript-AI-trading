The Home Depot reported a strong Q4 and full-year 2005 performance, with record sales, margin expansion, and robust share repurchases, indicating good management of costs and shareholder returns. However, there was a slight dip in gross margin for the quarter due to the mix of sales. The multi-dimensional growth strategy, including acquisitions and the addition of new and innovative products, along with positive guidance for 2006, should provide a slight boost to the stock in the short-term.
