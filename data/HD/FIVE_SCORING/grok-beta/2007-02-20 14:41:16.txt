Home Depot's Q4 performance revealed challenges in the housing market impacting both retail sales with a negative comp of 6.6% and difficulties in appliance sales price deflation. While the company is investing in enhancing customer experience, managing inventory effectively, and exploring strategic alternatives for Supply, these efforts might take time to yield positive results. Given the current market dynamics and the lack of immediate positive guidance, the stock may see short-term pressure from investors concerned about comp trends and decelerating growth in a challenging economic environment.
