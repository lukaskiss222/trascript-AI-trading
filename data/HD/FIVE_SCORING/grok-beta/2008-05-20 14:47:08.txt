While Home Depot made strategic decisions aimed at improving customer service and managing expenses, the earnings call revealed notable challenges such as a 6.5% comp sales decline, significant housing market weakness, and anticipated further declines in the second quarter due to calendar shifts. However, efforts to rationalize store growth, invest in international markets, and enhance customer engagement could position the company better in the future. Despite operational improvements, the short-term outlook suggests pressures continue to mount, which is likely to impact the stock negatively over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
