The Home Depot reported a third-quarter sales decline of 8% with negative comps, yet there are signs of stabilization in customer transactions, slight improvement in big ticket transactions, and gains in DIY repair categories. However, the forecast for Q4 projects continued sales decline, and although gross margins show improvement, operating expenses are expected to deleverage heavily due to tougher comparisons and increased costs. The sustainability of cost-cutting measures beyond 2009 remains uncertain, and while inventory reduction is positive, broader economic pressures on both DIY and pro customers could limit short-term stock price growth. The company's guidance for EPS growth in a challenging revenue environment suggests cautious optimism but points towards flat to slightly negative short-term stock movement due to mixed signals from performance metrics and guidance.
