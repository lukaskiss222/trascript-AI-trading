Based on the earnings call transcript, Home Depot showed several positive signs despite the challenging environment:

Key Positives:
- First positive comp transactions in 5 years
- Largest market share gains in 5 years 
- Improved performance in hard-hit markets like California and Florida
- Strong expense control and inventory management
- Raised full-year earnings guidance

Key Concerns:
- Pro business remains weak (down to 27% from 32% of sales)
