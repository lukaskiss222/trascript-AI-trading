Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative impact on Home Depot's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for several key reasons:

1. The company provided weak guidance for 2008, forecasting sales declines of 4-5% and earnings per share declines of 19-24%, which was worse than expected.

2. Management indicated that housing market conditions deteriorated further in Q4, with January being particularly weak (comps down 10.8%). While recent trends showed some improvement, they expect continued weakness.

3. The company faces rising costs from its private label credit card program, which will create 50 basis points of operating margin pressure in 2008.

4. They are pausing their stock buyback/recapitalization program due to business uncertainty and credit market conditions.

5. While they are making progress on strategic initiatives like supply chain optimization, these will be earnings dilutive in the near-term before benefits materialize in 2010.

The overall tone was cautious and defensive, with management emphasizing the challenging environment ahead. The negative guidance and rising cost pressures will likely lead to downward earnings revisions and stock price pressure in the short-term.
