Based on the earnings call transcript, Home Depot faced significant challenges in Q1 with same-store sales declining 7.6%, worse than expected. Key concerns include:

1. Weaker than anticipated performance due to poor weather and continued housing market softness
2. Margin pressure from accelerated clearance activity and mix shift to lower-margin categories
3. Higher operating expenses from strategic investments in stores/employees
4. Lowered guidance to the low-end of previous range

However, there are some positive signs:
- Improved employee morale and customer service metrics
- Strategic investments continuing as planned
- International operations performing well
- Management maintaining long-term strategy despite short-term pressures

The near-term outlook appears challenging with housing market headwinds persisting. While management is making appropriate long-term investments, the next 1-2 weeks will likely see stock pressure due to the earnings miss and lowered guidance.
