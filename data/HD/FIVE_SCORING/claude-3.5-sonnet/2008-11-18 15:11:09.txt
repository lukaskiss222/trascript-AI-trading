Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Home Depot's likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Points:
1. Same-store sales declined 8.3% in Q3, with November trends matching October's weak -10.5% 
2. Management lowered full-year sales guidance from -5% to -8%
3. Big ticket sales (>$500) deteriorated significantly in October
4. Seeing weakness spread from troubled housing markets to previously strong regions
5. Credit availability tightening for customers

Positive Factors:
- Maintained full-year EPS guidance despite sales weakness
- Strong inventory management with per-store inventory down 7.5%
- Gross margins improved 27 basis points
- Making progress on strategic initiatives (supply chain, portfolio strategy)

However, the significantly deteriorating sales trends, spreading geographic weakness, and cautious outlook for Q4 and 2009 will likely overshadow the operational improvements in the near-term.

Given the clear deterioration in business conditions and lowered guidance, I expect negative pressure on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
