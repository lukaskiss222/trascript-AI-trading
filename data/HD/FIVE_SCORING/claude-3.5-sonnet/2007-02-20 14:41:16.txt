Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Home Depot's short-term stock outlook:

Keys points impacting the 1-2 week outlook:

Positives:
- Strong international performance (positive comps in Canada, double-digit comps in Mexico)
- Maintained solid inventory control
- Continued investment in store improvements

Negatives:
- Significant deceleration in same-store sales (negative 6.6% in Q4)
- Sharp decline in January comps (negative 11.4%)
- Ongoing housing market headwinds expected
- Uncertainty around potential sale of HD Supply business
- Operating margin declined 260 basis points to 7.9%

The company faces clear near-term challenges with the housing slowdown and declining comps. Management's cautious outlook and acknowledgment of "continuing headwinds" in 2007 will likely pressure the stock. The strategic review of HD Supply adds uncertainty. While there are some bright spots internationally, the core U.S. business faces significant pressure that will likely dominate sentiment in the immediate term.
