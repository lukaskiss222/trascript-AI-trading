Based on my analysis of the earnings call transcript, I would predict a slightly positive short-term impact on Home Depot's stock price for the following reasons:

1. While Q1 comps were slightly negative (-0.6%), management attributed this primarily to weather impacts rather than fundamental business weakness. May sales have already shown improvement.

2. The company maintained its full-year sales growth guidance of 2.5% and actually raised EPS guidance slightly, showing confidence in the underlying business.

3. Management highlighted strength in core non-weather categories (electrical, kitchens, tools, etc.) and good execution on margins despite commodity pressures.

However, the upside appears modest given:
- Uncertain macro environment (gas prices, housing market)
- Some risk around seasonal inventory sell-through
- Mixed signals on big ticket spending
