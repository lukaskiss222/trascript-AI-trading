Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Home Depot's stock price. Key positives include: record quarterly transactions, strong comp sales growth of 5.8%, better-than-expected Q1 performance leading to raised full-year guidance, and improving pro customer segment (especially large pros growing 11%). While there are some concerns about sales pull-forward due to weather and expected Q2 deceleration, the overall tone was confident with solid execution across merchandising, supply chain, and operations. Management's measured optimism about housing recovery potential suggests upside.
