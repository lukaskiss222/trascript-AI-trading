Based on this earnings call transcript, I project a positive short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Home Depot's stock price. Key positives include: strong Q3 results with comps up 4.2%, raised full-year guidance, positive housing market commentary, continued margin expansion through operational improvements, and potential upside from Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts. While management was cautious on quantifying Sandy's impact, the overall tone was confident regarding the company's positioning and execution. The primary focus on core business strength rather than one-time events suggests sustainable momentum.
