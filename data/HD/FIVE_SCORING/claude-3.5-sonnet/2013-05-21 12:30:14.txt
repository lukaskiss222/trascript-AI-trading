Based on my analysis of the earnings call transcript, I predict a positive short-term impact on Home Depot's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

- Strong Q1 results with sales up 7.4% and comps up 4.3%, beating expectations
- Management raised full year guidance for both sales and earnings, showing confidence
- Pro customer segment outpaced consumer segment for first time in recovery, indicating housing market strength
- Seasonal sales weakness was weather-related and expected to shift into Q2, with May sales described as "great"
- California and Florida markets showing robust double-digit growth, suggesting housing recovery momentum

The overall tone was quite positive, with management highlighting multiple growth drivers and expressing confidence in the housing recovery while maintaining cost discipline. The raised guidance and strong early Q2 trends suggest near-term upside.
