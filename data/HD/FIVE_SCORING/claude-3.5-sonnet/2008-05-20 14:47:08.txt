Based on the earnings call transcript, I see several key points that will likely impact Home Depot's stock price in the next 1-2 weeks:

Positives:
- Gross margins expanded due to better inventory management and reduced promotions
- International business showing strength with double-digit comps in Mexico and China
- Making progress on strategic initiatives like supply chain transformation and store service improvements
- Maintained low end of full year guidance

Negatives:
- Comps declined 6.5% (9.2% adjusted for calendar shift)
- Seeing continued weakness in key markets like California and Florida
- Rising cost pressures from fuel/commodities
- Credit costs higher than expected at 96 basis points impact
- Q2 expected to be worst comping quarter of year due to calendar shift

Overall, while management is executing well on strategic initiatives, the near-term sales environment remains very challenging with housing market headwinds and rising costs. The calendar shift will create additional pressure in Q2. The maintained guidance provides some stability but the negative trends suggest limited upside catalysts in the next few weeks.
