Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly negative short-term impact on Home Depot's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key factors:

- Weak comparable store sales (-7.9%) indicating continued pressure from housing market
- Management remains cautious on near-term outlook through 2H 2008 and into 2009
- Some operational challenges (RDC rollout delays, expense pressures)

However, there are some mitigating factors:
- Beat internal forecasts on sales and earnings
- Good inventory management and cost control
- New credit agreement with Citi will reduce volatility
- Some stabilization in worst markets

Overall, while long-term fundamentals appear intact, near-term headwinds and cautious guidance suggest modest downward pressure on the stock in the very short term.
