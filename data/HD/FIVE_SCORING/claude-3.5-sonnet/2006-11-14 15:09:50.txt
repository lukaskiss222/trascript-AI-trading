Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on Home Depot's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for several key reasons:

1. Significant guidance reduction for Q4 and full year 2006, with management projecting Q4 earnings to decline 12-16% year-over-year.

2. Management's bearish outlook on housing market conditions, with CEO indicating they "haven't seen bottom yet" and expect pressure throughout 2007.

3. Concerning deceleration in same-store sales throughout Q3 (Aug: -1%, Sept: -4.3%, Oct: -8.7%).

4. Margin pressure from both retail and supply segments, with gross margins declining and operating expenses growing faster than sales.

While there are some positives (continued investment in stores, market share gains in select categories), the significant near-term headwinds and deteriorating fundamentals are likely to pressure the stock in the immediate term as investors digest the weaker outlook.
