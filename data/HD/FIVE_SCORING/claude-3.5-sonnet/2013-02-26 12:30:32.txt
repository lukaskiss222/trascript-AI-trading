Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Home Depot's short-term stock outlook:

Positive Factors:
- Strong Q4 performance with 7% comp sales growth
- Healthy housing market recovery indicators
- Improving pro customer segment performance
- Conservative guidance leaving room for upside
- Strong balance sheet with plans for increased dividends and share buybacks

Potential Concerns:
- Conservative 2013 guidance of only 3% comp sales growth
- Some benefit from one-time hurricane sales
- Management notes GDP growth expected to be modest
- Credit availability remains constrained for customers

Overall Analysis:
The earnings call reveals a company executing well with multiple growth drivers intact, while maintaining conservative guidance. Management's confidence is evident in the 34% dividend increase and $17B share repurchase authorization. While guidance appears conservative, the underlying business fundamentals and housing recovery suggest continued momentum.

Conclusion:
Given the strong execution, housing market tailwinds, and conservative guidance leaving room for upside, I expect a positive short-term stock reaction.
