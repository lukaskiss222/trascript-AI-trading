Based on my analysis of Home Depot's Q3 2011 earnings call, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following reasons:

1. The company demonstrated solid operational execution with positive comps (+4.2%), margin expansion, and expense control despite a challenging environment. Management expressed confidence in achieving their operating margin targets.

2. The announcement of a 16% dividend increase and continued share repurchases signals financial strength and commitment to shareholder returns, while maintaining a conservative balance sheet approach.

The positive fundamentals combined with shareholder-friendly capital allocation moves are likely to be well-received by investors in the near term, though tempered somewhat by cautious commentary around Q4 comparisons and housing market headwinds.
