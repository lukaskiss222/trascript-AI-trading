Based on this earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely 1-2 week impact on Home Depot's stock:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q1 results with comps +4.8% and first positive US comps since 2005
- Raised full year guidance on sales and earnings
- Improved gross margins through better inventory management
- Strong seasonal business performance 
- Supply chain initiatives progressing well

Key Concerns:
- Pro business still negative (though improving)
- Pulled forward some seasonal sales from Q2
- Q2 comps expected to be lower than Q1
- Big ticket/discretionary purchases remain weak
- Housing market uncertainty with tax credit expiration

The overall tone was positive but measured. Management delivered strong results while being appropriately cautious about the recovery pace. The raised guidance and operational improvements should provide near-term support, though some profit-taking is possible given the stock's recent run-up and Q2 expectations being tempered.

Rating: [1]

Rationale: The strong Q1 results and raised guidance should drive modest positive sentiment over the next 1-2 weeks, though upside may be limited by the cautious Q2 outlook and housing market uncertainties. The operational improvements and management execution provide support.
