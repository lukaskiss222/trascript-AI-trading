Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly negative short-term impact on Home Depot's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

While management demonstrated strong execution on inventory management, cost control, and supply chain improvements, several concerning factors emerged:

1. Guidance for 2009 was quite weak, projecting a 9% sales decline and 26% adjusted EPS decline
2. Management noted significant uncertainty in the market and housing continues to deteriorate
3. Previously resilient markets are now showing weakness while troubled markets (FL, CA) are still declining, just at a slower rate
4. Promotional environment remains challenging with pressure from competitors

However, some positives help moderate the negative outlook:
- Strong inventory control and margin management
- Progress on strategic initiatives like RDCs
- Solid execution on cost reduction
- Maintaining market share in key categories

The overall tone suggests continued near-term pressure but good operational execution in a difficult environment. Given the weak guidance and macro uncertainty emphasized, I expect modest stock price decline in the short term.
