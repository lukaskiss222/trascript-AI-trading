Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Home Depot's stock price. Here's my reasoning:

1. Challenging Market Environment:
- Housing market remains weak with housing starts down 22%, existing home sales down 12%
- Company expects continued difficult conditions through 2007 and into 2008
- Comparable store sales declined 5.2%

2. Financial Performance:
- Sales decreased 1.8% year-over-year
- Operating margin declined 137 basis points to 11.5%
- Company lowered full-year guidance, expecting 12-15% earnings decline

3. Uncertainty Around HD Supply Sale:
- Management unable to provide clarity on HD Supply sale status
- This creates uncertainty around their planned recapitalization and share buyback

While there were some positive signs (improved transaction counts, success in certain departments), the overall negative guidance, market headwinds, and uncertainty around strategic initiatives will likely pressure the stock in the near term.
