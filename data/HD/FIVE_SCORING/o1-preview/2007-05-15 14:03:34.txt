The Home Depot reported weaker-than-anticipated results, with same-store sales declining more than expected and earnings guidance lowered to the low end of prior estimates. Management cited challenges including a soft housing market, unseasonably cold weather, and increased expenses due to strategic investments, which are expected to continue pressuring earnings in the short term. These factors are likely to negatively impact the stock price in the near term.
