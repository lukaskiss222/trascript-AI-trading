Home Depot reported declining sales and negative same-store sales worse than planned, with significant weakness in key markets like California and Florida. The company expressed concerns about the challenging housing market and economic pressures, leading them to be more comfortable with the low end of their EPS guidance. Given the negative trends and cautious outlook, the stock is likely to face short-term downward pressure.
