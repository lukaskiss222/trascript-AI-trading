The Home Depot reported a 3.5% decline in third-quarter sales, with same-store sales down 6.2% and earnings per share decreasing by 9%. Management expressed caution about ongoing challenges in the housing and home improvement markets, delayed their recapitalization plan, and anticipated continued difficult conditions into 2008. This cautious outlook and negative performance are likely to exert short-term pressure on the stock price.
