Home Depot reported strong first-quarter results, with sales and comparable store sales exceeding expectations, aided by unusually warm weather that accelerated seasonal demand. The company raised its full-year EPS guidance, demonstrating confidence despite acknowledging some pull-forward of sales from the second quarter. Management's optimistic tone and continued investment in growth initiatives suggest a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
