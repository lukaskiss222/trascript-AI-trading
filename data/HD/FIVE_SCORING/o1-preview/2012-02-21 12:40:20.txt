Home Depot reported strong Q4 results with a 5.7% increase in comparable sales and a 6.1% rise in U.S. stores, exceeding expectations. The company saw broad-based growth across all markets and departments, fueled by solid execution, increased customer traffic due to warm weather, and strength in both transactions and average ticket. Despite acknowledging macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential pull-forward effect of sales, the management's optimistic outlook, commitment to shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, and ongoing strategic initiatives suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
