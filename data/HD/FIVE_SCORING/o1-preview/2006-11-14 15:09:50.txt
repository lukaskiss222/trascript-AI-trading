Home Depot reported weak Q3 results with negative same-store sales and declining profit margins due to the significant slowdown in the US housing market. Management provided cautious guidance, expecting Q4 earnings per share to decline by up to 16% and indicating challenges may persist into 2007. This negative outlook and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds suggest the stock price may fall in the short term.
