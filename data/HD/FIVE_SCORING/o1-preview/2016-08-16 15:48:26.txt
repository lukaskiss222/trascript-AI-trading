Home Depot reported record-breaking quarterly sales and earnings, with a 6.6% increase in sales and 13.9% growth in diluted EPS. The company raised its EPS guidance for the year and remains optimistic about housing market tailwinds, while strong Pro sales and double-digit growth in key categories like appliances indicate robust demand. These positive results and an upbeat outlook are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
