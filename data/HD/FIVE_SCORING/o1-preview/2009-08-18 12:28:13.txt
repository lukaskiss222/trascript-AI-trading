The Home Depot reported better-than-expected earnings, raised its EPS guidance, and noted positive trends like increased U.S. comp transactions for the first time in over five years and significant market share gains. Despite a decline in sales, strong expense control and operational improvements led to stronger profitability. These factors suggest the stock will have a positive impact in the short term.
