Home Depotâ€™s Q2 results were slightly better than internal forecasts but still showed declining sales and earnings due to a weak housing market. Management maintained their guidance for the year and expressed caution about the near-term outlook. While there are positive signs like improved customer satisfaction and inventory management, ongoing market pressures suggest the stock will remain stable in the short term.
