The Home Depot delivered strong Q2 results, exceeding expectations with record net earnings and a 22.6% increase in EPS. Management raised EPS guidance for the year and reaffirmed sales guidance, signaling confidence despite mixed housing data. The increased share repurchase plan and broad-based growth across all departments suggest a great positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
