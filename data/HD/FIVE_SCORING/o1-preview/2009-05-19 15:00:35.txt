Home Depot reported declining sales and comps due to a challenging market but demonstrated effective cost control and margin improvement. Positive trends in customer transactions, market share gains, and improving metrics in May indicate potential short-term upside. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
