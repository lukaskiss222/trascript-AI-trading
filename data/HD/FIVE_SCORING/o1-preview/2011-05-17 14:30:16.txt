The Home Depot's Q1 earnings call highlighted a slight decrease in sales and negative comps, primarily due to weather-related factors impacting their largest division. However, management maintained their full-year sales growth projection of 2.5% and increased EPS guidance, indicating confidence in operational initiatives and a strong start to May. The anticipated rebound in sales with improved weather suggests a neutral short-term impact on the stock price.
