- **Broad-Based Strength**: All top 40 markets posted double-digit comparable sales growth, and both Pro and DIY customer segments showed strong growth. The company saw significant strength in various categories, including lumber, kitchen and bath, and outdoor living[1].
- **Effective Supply Chain Management**: Despite global supply chain disruptions and port congestion, Home Depot managed to maintain in-stock positions and prioritize key SKUs, which helped in meeting the high demand[1].
- **Investments in Interconnected Retail**: The company continues to enhance its digital capabilities, with sales through digital platforms increasing by 27%. New features like mixed cart selling and rent online, pickup in store capabilities are expected to improve customer experience and drive further growth[1].
