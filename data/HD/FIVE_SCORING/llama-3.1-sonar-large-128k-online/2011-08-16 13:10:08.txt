Based on the transcript of The Home Depot's second quarter 2011 earnings call, here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Positive Sales and Comps**: The company reported a 4.2% increase in sales and a 4.3% increase in comparable sales, driven by strong performance in core departments and seasonal categories. This positive sales trend is likely to be viewed favorably by investors.

2. **Operational Efficiency**: Home Depot highlighted significant improvements in supply chain efficiency, reduced manual scheduling activities, and the successful rollout of Buy Online Pickup In-Store (BOPIS), which are expected to continue driving benefits.

3. **Expense Control**: The company demonstrated strong expense control, with operating expenses as a percent of sales decreasing by 70 basis points. This, combined with a modest gross margin expansion, suggests effective management of costs.

4. **Guidance**: Home Depot maintained its sales guidance for the year and increased its earnings guidance, indicating confidence in their performance despite economic uncertainties.

5. **Customer Engagement and Market Share**: The company reported improvements in customer service metrics, such as Net Promoter Score, and continued to gain market share in various categories, which are positive indicators for long-term growth.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong operational performance, efficient cost management, and maintained guidance.
