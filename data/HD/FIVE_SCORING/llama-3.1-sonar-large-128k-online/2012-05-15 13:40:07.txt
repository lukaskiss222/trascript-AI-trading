The Home Depot's Q1 2012 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

## Strong Quarterly Performance
- The company reported a 5.9% increase in sales and a 5.8% increase in same-store sales, driven by unusually warm weather and strong performance in core business areas.

## Guidance and Outlook
- Despite the strong quarter, the company noted that the fundamental assumptions behind their 2012 financial plan haven't changed, and they adjusted their guidance to reflect the sales pulled forward due to weather. This suggests a balanced view on future performance.

## Supply Chain and Operational Efficiency
- The new supply chain system performed well under the stress of unusual demand, which is a positive indicator for future operational efficiency.

## Pro Business Recovery
- The recovery in the pro business is sequential, with larger pro customers recovering faster than smaller ones. This trend is closely monitored and could indicate future growth potential.

## Competitive Environment
- There was no significant impact noted from AmazonSupply, and the company remains confident in its market position and ability to gain share in various business categories.

Given these points, here are the key takeaways for short-term stock impact:

- The strong quarterly performance and efficient supply chain management are positive indicators.
- The adjusted guidance reflects a realistic outlook rather than over-optimism.
- The recovery trends in the pro business and competitive stability are additional positives.

However, the second quarter is expected to have lower comps due to the pull-forward of sales, which might temper short-term enthusiasm.

### Conclusion
The overall positive performance, efficient operations, and stable guidance suggest a positive but not overly enthusiastic short-term impact on the stock price.
