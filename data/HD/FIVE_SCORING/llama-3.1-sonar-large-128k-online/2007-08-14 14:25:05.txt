The Home Depot's second-quarter earnings call highlighted several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Challenging Market Conditions**: The company faced a difficult housing market, with housing starts down 22%, existing home sales down 12%, and a high inventory of homes for sale. Despite these challenges, the company's performance was generally in line with expectations.

2. **Sales and Comps**: Total sales decreased by 1.8%, and comparable sales were down 5.2%. However, the company saw positive comps in international markets and some regional strength in the U.S..

3. **Cost Control and Efficiency**: The company managed to reduce expenses by $140 million, largely through controlled advertising and operations costs. This efficiency could be viewed positively by investors.

4. **Investments and Long-Term Focus**: Home Depot is investing heavily in store improvements, associate compensation, and supply chain enhancements, which are expected to benefit the business in the long term but may pressure short-term earnings.

5. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company expects continued difficult conditions in the second half of the year, with earnings per share from continuing operations projected to decline by 12% to 15% for fiscal 2007. This guidance might be seen as cautious by investors.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the challenging market conditions, reduced sales, and the anticipation of continued earnings decline. However, the company's focus on long-term investments and cost control measures could provide some stability.
