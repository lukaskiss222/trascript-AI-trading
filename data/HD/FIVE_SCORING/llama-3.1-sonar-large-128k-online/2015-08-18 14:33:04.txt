- **Acquisition and Integration**: The acquisition of Interline Brands is expected to add $750 million in sales and about $0.01 in EPS accretion, which is seen as a strategic move to enhance the company's ability to serve the pro customer more comprehensively[5].
- **Operational Efficiency**: The company saw improvements in gross margin and operating expenses, driven by supply chain productivity, lower fuel costs, and operational enhancements[5].
- **Guidance Update**: The company raised its sales and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2015, reflecting the outperformance and the anticipated benefits from the Interline acquisition[5].

### Stable Indicators:
- **Consistent Regional Performance**: The company noted stable regional performance with minimal variability, indicating a balanced housing recovery[5].
- **Macro Support**: Home price appreciation, housing turnover, and household formation data suggest continued support for the home improvement market[5].
