The Home Depot's first-quarter earnings call revealed several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Sales and Comps**: The company reported a 9.7% decline in sales and a 10.2% decline in comparable sales, which is a continuation of the challenging environment in the home improvement sector. However, there were some positive trends, such as improved performance in certain product categories like seasonal items, repair and maintenance, and simple remodels.

2. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company maintained its fiscal 2009 guidance, expecting sales to be down 9% and adjusted earnings per share to decline by 26%. The first half of the year is anticipated to be softer than the second half, but there is an expectation of sequential improvement.

3. **Operational Improvements**: Despite the sales decline, Home Depot achieved inventory reduction, maintained high in-stock levels, and expanded its merchandising tools, which helped in gaining market share and improving gross margins in the U.S..

4. **Customer Service and Net Promoter Score**: The company saw a significant improvement in its net promoter score, indicating better customer service, which could positively impact future sales and customer loyalty.

5. **Foreclosure Impact**: The accelerating rate of foreclosures, particularly in regions like California, continues to pressure comp performance, adding a cautious note to the outlook.

Given these points:

- The ongoing weakness in the home improvement market and the impact of foreclosures are likely to keep short-term pressure on the stock.
- However, the company's operational improvements, share gains, and improved customer service metrics suggest some resilience and potential for long-term stability.
- The maintained guidance and expectations of sequential improvement in the second half of the year provide a mixed but slightly positive outlook.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility but may stabilize or see slight gains as the company's operational efficiencies and customer service improvements become more evident.
