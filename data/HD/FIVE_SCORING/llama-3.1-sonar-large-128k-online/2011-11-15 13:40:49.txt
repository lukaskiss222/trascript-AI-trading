The Home Depot's third-quarter 2011 earnings call presents several key points that can influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Positive Sales and Comps**: The company reported a 4.4% increase in sales and a 4.2% increase in same-store sales, driven by core categories and storm-related sales. This positive performance is likely to be viewed favorably by investors[6.).

2. **Operational Improvements**: Significant investments in supply chain transformation, new merchandising tools, and operational initiatives have led to improved efficiency and productivity. These improvements, including the rollout of initiatives like Buy Online Pickup In-Store, are expected to continue benefiting the company in the short term.

3. **Financial Performance**: The company reported a gross margin expansion, operating expense leverage, and a 17.6% increase in earnings per share. These financial metrics indicate strong management of costs and a solid financial footing.

4. **Guidance and Outlook**: Despite a tough comparison in the fourth quarter due to the anniversary of energy-efficient tax credits, the company remains confident in its ability to deliver positive comps. The updated guidance and capital allocation strategy, including a dividend increase and continued share repurchases, suggest a positive outlook.

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong performance, operational efficiencies, and solid financial guidance.
