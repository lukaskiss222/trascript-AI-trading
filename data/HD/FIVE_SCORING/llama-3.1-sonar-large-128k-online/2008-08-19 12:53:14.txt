The Home Depot's second-quarter earnings call reveals several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Challenging Environment**: The company is operating in a difficult housing and home improvement market, with negative comp sales and decreased earnings per share. This environment is expected to continue, which could maintain downward pressure on the stock[5].

2. **Mixed Performance**: While the company saw some positive trends, such as improved customer satisfaction and solid performance in basic repair items, overall sales and earnings were down. The company also benefited from the economic stimulus package, but this is not sustainable[5].

3. **Guidance**: The guidance for fiscal 2008 indicates a 5% decline in sales and a 24% decline in earnings per share, which is consistent with previous expectations but still negative. This guidance does not include the store rationalization charge[5].

4. **Operational Improvements**: Despite the challenges, the company has made significant progress in areas like merchandising execution, inventory management, and customer satisfaction. However, these improvements may not immediately translate into positive stock performance given the broader market conditions[5].

5. **Cost and Credit**: The new credit agreement with Citi reduces the volatility in the cost of credit, which is a positive long-term development but may not have an immediate impact on the stock price[5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the challenging market environment, negative comp sales, and reduced earnings guidance. However, the company's operational improvements and long-term strategic moves suggest stability and potential for future growth.
