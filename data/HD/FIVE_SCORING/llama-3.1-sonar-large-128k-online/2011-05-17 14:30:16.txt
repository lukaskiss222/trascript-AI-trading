The Home Depot's first quarter 2011 earnings call highlighted several key points that will likely influence the stock's short-term performance:

## Positive Factors
- Despite a slight decline in sales due to adverse weather, the company reported a 16.3% increase in diluted earnings per share, driven by strong performance in non-seasonal categories such as electrical, tools, and kitchens[3][4].
- The company raised its fiscal 2011 diluted earnings-per-share guidance to $2.24, reflecting strong operational performance and the benefits of share repurchases[3][4].
- Gross margin expanded by 28 basis points, largely due to a lower penetration of lower-margin seasonal categories and benefits from the company's portfolio strategy and supply chain improvements[3][4].

## Neutral to Negative Factors
- The negative impact of weather on the northern division of U.S. stores, which is the largest division, resulted in a negative 0.7% comp for U.S. stores. However, the company expects to recover some of these lost sales as weather improves[3][4].
- Inventory levels were maintained in anticipation of a strong spring selling season, which could lead to potential markdowns if sales do not materialize as expected in the second quarter[3][4].

## Overall Outlook
Given the mixed results, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive reaction in the short term. The raised earnings guidance and strong performance in core categories are positive indicators, but the impact of weather and potential inventory markdowns introduce some uncertainty.

### Rating: 1
The stock will likely see a positive impact due to the strong earnings growth and raised guidance, despite some short-term challenges related to weather and inventory management.
