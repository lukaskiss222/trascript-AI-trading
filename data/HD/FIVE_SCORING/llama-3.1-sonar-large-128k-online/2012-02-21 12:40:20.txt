The Home Depot's fourth-quarter 2011 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Positive Sales and Comps**: The company reported a 5.9% increase in sales and a 5.7% increase in comparable sales, driven by unusually warm weather and strong performance in core merchandising areas. This positive performance is likely to be viewed favorably by investors[3].

2. **Operational Improvements**: Significant improvements in customer-facing labor hours, supply chain efficiencies, and the introduction of new services like in-store repair for power equipment and tools suggest ongoing operational strengths. These improvements can enhance the company's ability to drive sales and retain customers[3].

3. **Macro and Housing Market Uncertainty**: Despite positive sales, the company noted uncertainties in the housing market and macroeconomic conditions. However, they emphasized that their business is well-positioned to grow consistently with U.S. GDP, which might mitigate some of the macro risks[3].

4. **Guidance and Financial Performance**: The guidance for 2012, including expected sales growth of around 4% and diluted EPS of about $2.72, is generally positive. The company also highlighted its commitment to disciplined capital allocation, share buybacks, and dividend increases, which are typically well-received by investors[3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong quarterly performance, operational improvements, and generally positive guidance.
