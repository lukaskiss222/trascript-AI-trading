The Home Depot's Q3 2012 earnings call presents several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Positive Sales and Earnings**: The company reported a 4.6% increase in sales and a 4.2% increase in same-store sales, beating expectations. This positive performance, especially in the face of tough year-over-year comparisons, is a strong indicator.

2. **Housing Market Recovery**: Management expressed cautious optimism about the housing market recovery, noting that housing is starting to be a positive contributor to GDP and that their performance reflects this trend. This is a positive sign for long-term growth but may not immediately impact short-term stock performance.

3. **Hurricane Sandy Impact**: While the exact impact of Hurricane Sandy is uncertain, the company expects it to be significant, potentially similar to or larger than the impact of Hurricane Irene. However, this impact is not included in their current guidance, which could lead to positive surprises in the coming quarters.

4. **Operational Improvements**: The company highlighted various operational improvements, including better supply chain management, reduced shrinkage, and successful pilots in new product categories, which suggest ongoing efficiency and growth potential.

5. **Guidance Update**: The updated guidance reflects a more positive outlook, with expected fiscal 2012 sales increases and earnings per share growth. However, the guidance does not account for the potential benefits from Hurricane Sandy, which could provide an upside surprise.

Given these points, particularly the strong sales performance, positive signs of housing market recovery, and potential upside from Hurricane Sandy, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
