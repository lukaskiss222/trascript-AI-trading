The Home Depot's third-quarter earnings call painted a challenging picture for the company, reflecting the broader economic and housing market downturn. Here are the key points:

- **Sales Decline**: Sales were down 6.2% with negative same-store sales of 8.3%, and the company adjusted its full-year sales guidance to a potential decline of up to 8%.
- **Big Ticket Sales**: Big ticket sales, particularly those above $500, were significantly down, contributing to the decline in average ticket size.
- **Operational Challenges**: The company faces continued pressure from tightening consumer credit, higher cost of credit associated with private label credit cards, and a strong U.S. dollar impacting international sales.
- **Cost and Margin Management**: Despite these challenges, the company has managed to improve gross margins through better management of markdowns and a shift in product mix. However, operating expenses have deleveraged due to negative sales.
- **Inventory Management**: The company has done an excellent job in controlling inventory levels, with per-store inventory down 7.5% and clearance inventory at a record low.
- **Guidance and Outlook**: The company anticipates a challenging sales environment to continue into the fourth quarter and 2009, with no immediate signs of improvement.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the revised downward guidance, continued sales decline, and broader economic uncertainties.
