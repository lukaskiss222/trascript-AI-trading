The Home Depot's earnings call for Q1 2013 indicated strong company performance, with significant sales growth driven by larger ticket items and a recovering housing market, particularly aiding pro customer segments. Despite garden department weaknesses due to weather, the company's agile supply chain and diverse product offerings across various categories buoyed overall performance. Home Depot's increase in sales guidance, strategic initiatives in online and in-store services, and consumer demand resilience, suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
