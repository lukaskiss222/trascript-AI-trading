Caterpillar's earnings call revealed a sharp downward revision of their 2009 outlook, with sales expected to decline significantly and profit per share dropping to approximately $2.50 from $5.66. Management announced substantial cost-cutting measures, including nearly 20,000 job cuts and reductions in capital expenditures, and warned of a potential first-quarter loss due to weakened demand. These developments signal serious short-term challenges that are likely to negatively impact the stock price.
