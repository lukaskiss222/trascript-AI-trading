Caterpillar reported a 7% increase in sales and revenues despite headwinds in North America, but profit per share declined to $1.24 from $1.52 last year, falling short of expectations. Management expressed disappointment due to lower profitability driven by decreased North American machine sales, higher costs, and supply chain inefficiencies. Although they maintained full-year profit guidance and anticipate improvements, the profit miss and operational challenges are likely to negatively impact the stock in the short term.
