Caterpillar reported a significant earnings beat in Q1, with profit excluding redundancy costs at $0.39 per share versus the consensus estimate of $0.04, highlighting effective cost management. However, the company lowered its full-year 2009 guidance for sales and profit, reflecting ongoing economic challenges. The positive earnings surprise is offset by the cautious outlook, suggesting a neutral short-term impact on the stock price.
