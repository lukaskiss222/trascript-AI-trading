Caterpillar reported record sales and revenues for Q2 2011, with strong growth across all regions and a 58% increase in profit per share, excluding Bucyrus-related costs. The company raised its full-year outlook for both sales and profit, indicating confidence in continued demand and successful integration of Bucyrus. Despite some short-term costs from the acquisition, the positive performance and upward guidance suggest a favorable short-term impact on the stock.
