Caterpillar reported record-breaking Q4 and full-year results, raising its 2012 sales and profit guidance. Management expressed optimism about global growth, strong demand across regions, and a robust order backlog, particularly in mining. Despite some headwinds like increased tax expenses and Eurozone uncertainties, the positive outlook and operational efficiencies suggest the stock will likely see a positive impact in the short term.
