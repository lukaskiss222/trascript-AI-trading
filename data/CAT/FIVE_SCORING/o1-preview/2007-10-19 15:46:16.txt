Caterpillar's Q3 2007 earnings call highlighted record sales and revenues, driven by strong international growth in mining, oil, and gas sectors. However, the company lowered its profit guidance for 2007 due to rising costs and weak U.S. markets, particularly in housing and on-highway trucks. While management remains confident about long-term goals, the short-term concerns over higher costs and reduced profit outlook are likely to negatively impact the stock price.
