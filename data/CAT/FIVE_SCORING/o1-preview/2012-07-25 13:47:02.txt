Caterpillar reported record sales and profits, raising its full-year profit outlook despite a slight reduction in the top end of its sales guidance due to currency impacts and global economic uncertainties. Strong cost control, improved operational execution, and management's cautious optimism about future growth suggest positive momentum. The market is likely to react favorably to the increased profit outlook and strong performance.
