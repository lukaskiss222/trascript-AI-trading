Caterpillar's earnings call revealed a cautious outlook for 2015, citing significant expected declines in sales and revenues due to falling oil prices impacting their Energy and Transportation segment, continued weakness in mining, and a stronger dollar. Despite solid 2014 results, the projected drop in profit per share and negative macroeconomic factors suggest short-term pressure on the stock price. These combined factors are likely to negatively affect investor sentiment in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
