Caterpillar reported record quarterly sales and profits, with strong growth in emerging markets offsetting weaknesses in North America and Europe. Management slightly raised full-year guidance and announced a price increase for 2009 to address rising material costs, showing confidence in their pricing power and cost management. Despite concerns about slowing demand in developed markets, the strong performance and positive outlook are likely to boost investor sentiment in the short term.
