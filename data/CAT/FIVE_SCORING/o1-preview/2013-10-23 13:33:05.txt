Caterpillar reported significant declines in Q3 sales and earnings due to sharp weakness in its mining-related Resource Industries segment, which was down 42%. The company lowered its full-year guidance for 2013 and provided a cautious outlook for 2014, expecting flat sales and continued challenges in mining. These negative developments are likely to put short-term downward pressure on the stock price.
