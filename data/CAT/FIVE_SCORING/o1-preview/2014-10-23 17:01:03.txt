Caterpillar reported higher profit per share and raised its profit outlook for 2014, reflecting strong operational execution and cost management. Despite a cautious preliminary outlook for 2015 sales being flat to slightly up, the increased dividend, share buybacks, and solid performance in the Energy & Transportation segment are likely to bolster investor confidence. Overall, the positive earnings surprise and shareholder-friendly actions may lead to a short-term stock price appreciation.
