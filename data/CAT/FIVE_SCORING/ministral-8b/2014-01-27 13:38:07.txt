The earnings call for Caterpillar Inc. was marked by a mixed bag of results and expectations. The company reported a strong year in terms of cash flow and balance sheet, with a $10 billion stock repurchase authorization announced. However, the outlook for 2014 was relatively flat, with sales expected to be around $56 billion, and a cautious outlook for the mining industry due to low order rates and a decline in capex. The company also expects to take additional restructuring actions in 2014, which will impact earnings. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
