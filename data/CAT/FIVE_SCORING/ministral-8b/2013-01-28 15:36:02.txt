**Analysis:** Caterpillar reported strong sales and profit growth in 2012, but the company faced challenges in the second half of the year due to slowing global economies and inventory issues. Management successfully reduced inventory by $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, which positively impacted sales and efficiency. The company also provided a positive outlook for 2013. However, the stock market may react negatively to the inventory reduction, as it could indicate a slowdown in demand.

**Conclusion:** The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the inventory reduction and potential demand concerns.

**Rating:** [-1]
