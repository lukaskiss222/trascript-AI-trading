### Analysis

The earnings call for Caterpillar Inc. revealed a challenging first quarter, with sales and revenues down 17% year-over-year. The company's outlook for 2013 was revised downward, with sales and revenues expected to be in the range of $57 billion to $61 billion, compared to the previous guidance of $60 to $68 billion. The primary reason for the decline was the continued weakness in the mining sector, which is expected to be down about 50% in 2013.

Despite the challenging environment, Caterpillar's management highlighted several positive aspects, including improvements in order backlog and cash flow. The company also announced a $1 billion stock repurchase program, indicating confidence in its financial position and the potential for shareholder rewards.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on Caterpillar's stock price is likely to be negative due to the revised guidance and the ongoing challenges in the mining sector. The stock may face further pressure in the coming weeks as investors digest the company's outlook and reassess its prospects. However, the stock repurchase program could provide some support and indicate management's confidence in the company's future.
