Based on the earnings transcript, Caterpillar Inc. reported a challenging first quarter due to a significant decline in sales and revenues, driven by a global economic downturn and reduced demand for new machines and engines. Despite these headwinds, the company maintained positive price realization and made significant cost reduction efforts. The outlook for 2009 is cautiously optimistic, with the company expecting sales and revenues of $35 billion, plus or minus 10%, and a profit of $1.25 per share, excluding redundancy costs. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Rating:** -1 (Negative impact)
