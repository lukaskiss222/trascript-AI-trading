### Analysis

The earnings call for Caterpillar Inc. reveals a mixed picture. The company reported record annual sales and profits, but the outlook for 2009 is grim. The company expects a significant decline in sales and revenues, and a loss in the first quarter due to redundancy costs and inventory reductions. Management is taking aggressive cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and plant shutdowns, to respond to the challenging economic conditions. The outlook for 2010 is also uncertain, with the company expecting a recovery in commodity prices and a return to more normal operating conditions.

### Conclusion

Given the significant decline in sales and revenues expected for 2009, along with the uncertainty around the economic recovery, the short-term outlook for Caterpillar Inc. is negative. The stock is likely to face pressure in the coming weeks due to the company's challenging outlook and the uncertainty surrounding the global economic recovery. The aggressive cost-cutting measures and the company's focus on long-term growth are positive signs, but the immediate impact on the stock price is likely to be negative.
