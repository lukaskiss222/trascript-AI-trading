### Analysis

**Short-term Implications (1â€“2 weeks):**

1. **Record Sales and Profit:** Caterpillar reported record sales and profit for the second quarter of 2012, with a significant increase in operating margin. This indicates strong performance and execution in the quarter.

2. **Outlook Adjustment:** The company revised its sales and revenue outlook downwards due to currency translation and weaker global economic expectations. This adjustment may lead to a temporary negative sentiment among investors.

3. **Inventory Management:** The company is actively working to reduce inventory, especially in China, where the construction equipment market remains weak. This effort may impact short-term sales but could be beneficial in the long run.

4. **Economic Uncertainty:** The company acknowledged the global economic uncertainty, particularly in Europe and the U.S., and expressed cautious optimism for 2013. This uncertainty could lead to volatility in the stock price.

5. **Acquisition Integration:** The company is focusing on integrating its recent acquisitions, particularly Bucyrus, which may take some time to show significant synergy benefits. This could impact investor expectations in the short term.

### Conclusion

Given the strong second quarter performance, the downward revision in outlook, and the ongoing economic uncertainty, the stock price may experience some volatility in the short term. However, the company's focus on inventory management and cautious optimism for the future could provide some stability.
