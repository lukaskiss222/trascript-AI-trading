Based on the provided transcript, here's a concise analysis and prediction for the short-term impact on Caterpillar Inc.'s stock price:

**Analysis:**
- The company reported a 6% decline in sales and revenues, primarily due to reduced dealer inventory and lower-than-expected demand from end users.
- Management lowered the 2019 profit per share guidance to $10.90-$11.40, citing dealer caution and uncertainty in the global economic environment.
- The company expects a $900 million reduction in dealer inventories in the fourth quarter, which will likely lead to lower production and shipments.
- Caterpillar's strong balance sheet and commitment to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases provide some support for the stock.

**Prediction:**
Given the mixed signals in the earnings report and the lowered guidance, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure. However, the company's strong balance sheet and focus on operational excellence and expanded offerings suggest long-term potential. The stock is expected to rally slightly in the short term as the market digests the earnings report and guidance, but it may remain volatile due to ongoing uncertainty in the global economic environment.

**Rating:**
