### Analysis

Caterpillar's earnings call revealed strong financial performance, but also highlighted several challenges and uncertainties. The company reported record sales and profits, driven by robust international demand, particularly in the mining, oil and gas, and electric power generation sectors. However, the U.S. market remains weak, with housing starts and on-highway truck engines declining. The company also faced higher-than-expected core operating costs and a negative currency impact, which led to a downward revision in profit guidance for 2008. Despite these challenges, management expressed confidence in the company's ability to maintain growth and profitability, with plans to increase sales and profits in 2008 and beyond.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the downward revision in profit guidance and the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. economy. However, the company's strong international performance and management's commitment to cost savings and strategic growth suggest long-term potential. Overall, the stock is expected to experience a **negative impact** in the short term.
