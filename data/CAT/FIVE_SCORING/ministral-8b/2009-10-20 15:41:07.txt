### Analysis:

Caterpillar's Q3 2009 earnings call provided a mixed picture. The company reported a significant decline in sales and revenues, with a 44% drop from the third quarter of 2008. Despite this, the company managed to achieve a profit of $0.64 per share, largely due to favorable tax benefits and favorable manufacturing costs. The company also provided an updated outlook for 2009 and 2010, projecting sales and revenues to range from $32 to $33 billion and $55 to $60 billion, respectively.

### Conclusion:

The short-term impact on Caterpillar's stock price is likely to be positive, given the company's ability to maintain profitability despite the challenging market conditions. The favorable tax benefits and cost savings achieved in Q3 2009 will likely boost the company's earnings, leading to a potential stock price increase. Additionally, the company's outlook for 2010, which includes a projected sales increase of 10% to 25%, suggests that the company is well-positioned for a recovery in the market. Therefore, the short-term impact on Caterpillar's stock price is likely to be positive.
