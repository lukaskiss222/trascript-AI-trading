**Analysis:**

Caterpillar's Q2 earnings report showed strong performance, with sales and revenues up 20% and profit per share up 40% compared to the same period last year. The company's outlook for 2008 was adjusted slightly, with sales expected to be around $50 billion and profit per share around $6.00. However, the outlook for 2009 was not provided on the call. The company's management highlighted the challenges in the North American market and the impact of higher material and freight costs. They also mentioned the potential for price increases in 2009 to cover these costs. The analysts on the call asked about the potential for demand destruction due to price increases, but the management did not provide a clear answer. The call ended with the company's management expressing confidence in their ability to achieve their 2010 earnings goal of $8 to $10 per share, despite the challenging economic environment.

**Short-term implications:**

- **Positive:** The strong Q2 results and the adjusted outlook for 2008 could lead to a short-term rally in the stock price, as investors react positively to the company's performance.
- **Negative:** The challenges in the North American market and the potential for higher material and freight costs could lead to short-term pressure on the stock price, as investors worry about the company's ability to maintain its profit margins.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive, with the company's strong Q2 results and adjusted outlook for 2008 likely to outweigh the challenges in the North American market and the potential for higher material and freight costs. However, investors should be aware of the potential for short-term pressure on the stock price due to the company's exposure to the North American market and the potential for higher material and freight costs.
