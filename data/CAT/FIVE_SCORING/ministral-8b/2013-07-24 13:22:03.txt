Based on the earnings call transcript, the short-term implications for Caterpillar Inc. are as follows:

1. **Dealer Inventory Reduction**: The company expects further dealer inventory reduction in the second half of 2013, which will continue to be a headwind for sales and profit. This is the main reason for the lowered 2013 sales and profit outlook.

2. **Currency Impact**: The company experienced a substantial currency headwind in the second quarter, which was not expected to continue in the second half of the year. However, the company does not forecast future currency movements.

3. **Power Systems Segment**: The Power Systems segment remains stable and profitable, with a higher margin rate than other segments. The company expects this segment to continue to perform well.

4. **Resource Industries Segment**: The Resource Industries segment, primarily mining, is facing challenges due to reduced mining CapEx, lower end-user demand, and dealer inventory declines. The company expects this segment to continue to decline in the second half of the year.

5. **Cost Reduction Measures**: The company is implementing additional cost reduction measures in the second half of the year to improve profitability.

6. **Long-Term Outlook**: The company's long-term view of mining remains positive, with commodity demand driven by economic growth, population increase, and rising standards of living. The company expects continued growth in China, which is a major market for mining equipment.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is expected to be negative due to the continued headwinds in the mining segment and the uncertainty surrounding dealer inventory reductions. However, the long-term outlook remains positive, with the company expecting growth in China and other markets.
