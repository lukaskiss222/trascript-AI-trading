Caterpillar's Q3 earnings call revealed mixed signals, with record sales and profits, but also increased costs and a weaker-than-expected outlook for 2008. The company's guidance for 2008 implies lower incremental margins, which may be concerning for investors. However, management's confidence in the Cat Production System and its potential to drive long-term growth and profitability is a positive note. In the short term, the stock may face pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key markets.
