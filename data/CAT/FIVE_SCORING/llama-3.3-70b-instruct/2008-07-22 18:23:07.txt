Caterpillar's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with the company achieving record sales and profit despite weakness in North America and a weakening Europe. Management's tone was cautiously optimistic, with a focus on growth in emerging markets and efforts to manage costs. The guidance for 2008 was adjusted slightly, with a higher sales outlook but lower profit expectations due to higher material costs. The company's ability to implement price increases and manage supply chain constraints will be key to its short-term performance. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key markets, but long-term prospects remain positive.
