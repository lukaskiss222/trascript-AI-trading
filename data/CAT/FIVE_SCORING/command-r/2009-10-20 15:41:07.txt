Caterpillar's Q3 results exceeded expectations, but the stock is likely to experience a short-term negative impact due to the company's faltering full-year outlook. The guidance for a 10%â€“25% sales increase in 2010 may not be sufficient to mitigate the impact of reduced dealer inventories and Shributing uncertainties surrounding the global economic recovery, central bank policies, and end-user demand. Bicentennial costs and a strong US dollar also pose challenges. Despite these headwinds, the company's cost-cutting measures and focus on strategic growth are optimistic signs for the medium term.
