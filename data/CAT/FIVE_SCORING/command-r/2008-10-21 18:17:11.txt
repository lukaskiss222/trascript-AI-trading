Caterpillar’s Q3 earnings call projects a cautious outlook for 2009, anticipating a drop in sales and revenues in developed countries, partially offset by growth in emerging markets. The management’s emphasis on their dealer network, diverse product range, and strategic acquisitions bodes well for the medium term. However, elevated dealer inventories and the prospect of cancelled orders remain concerns in the current economic climate. The stock is likely to experience volatility in the short term, reflecting the uncertain environment.
