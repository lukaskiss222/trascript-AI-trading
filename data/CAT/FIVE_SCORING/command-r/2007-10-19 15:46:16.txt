Caterpillar's earnings call reveals a lackluster outlook for its North American operations due to a weak economy, depressed housing and on-highway truck markets. However, strong global growth outside North America and robust demand for mining and oil & gas equipment offer a partial offset. The main concern for investors is the unexpected surge in core operating costs, largely driven by inflation and start-up expenses related to Capacity expansion and the Cat Production System implementation. The stock is likely to face pressure in the short term due to these heightened costs and conservative 2008 guidance. [-1]
