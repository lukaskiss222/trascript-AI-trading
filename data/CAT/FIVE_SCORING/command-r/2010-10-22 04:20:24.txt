The earnings call revealed Caterpillar's impressive third-quarter profits and a positive outlook for the rest of 2010, with modest projections for 2011. While the stock may suffer from short-term uncertainty surrounding next year's emissions regulations and tepid global economic recovery, the long-term outlook is positive, fueled by robust demand in developing markets and ongoing operational improvements. The management's reserved tone regarding 2011 profit margins and the lack of specific guidance may cause some concerns. Overall, the stock is likely to consolidate in the short term but has potential for moderate growth.
