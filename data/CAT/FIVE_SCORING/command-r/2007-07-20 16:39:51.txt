Despite weak demand in North America, Caterpillar's global and diversified operations helped it achieve a 7% increase in Q2 sales. However, profit fell short of expectations due to efficient manufacturing, supply chain issues, and higher costs. The company's focus on implementing the CAT production system is a three-year plan that aims to improve operational efficiency and should contribute to margin expansion over time. Although some benefits are expected in the second half of 2007, significant improvements are more likely to be seen in 2008 and beyond. Investors should expect inventory adjustments and cost inefficiencies to impact short-term profitability. The stock is likely to experience pressure in the coming weeks. [-1]
