Caterpillar reported a record year with significant increases in sales, profits, and free cash flow, exceeding expectations and raising guidance for 2024. Management's positive tone on strategic investments and continued growth in key segments like Energy & Transportation should bolster investor confidence in the short term. Despite some regional and inventory concerns, the overall strong financial performance is likely to positively influence the stock.
