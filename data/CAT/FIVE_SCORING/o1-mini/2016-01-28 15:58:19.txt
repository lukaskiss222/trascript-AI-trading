Caterpillar reported significant declines in both quarterly and annual sales, accompanied by increased restructuring costs and lowered guidance for 2016. Despite proactive cost-cutting measures and strategic investments in digital technology, the overall sentiment remains cautious due to ongoing challenges in commodity markets and global economic weaknesses. This combination is likely to exert downward pressure on the stock in the short term.
