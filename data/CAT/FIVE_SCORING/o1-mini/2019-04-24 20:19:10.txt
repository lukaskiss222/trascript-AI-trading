Caterpillar reported a record first-quarter profit and solid sales growth, driven by strong performance in Resource and Construction Industries. Despite rising manufacturing costs and some regional sales declines, the companyâ€™s robust cash flow and continued investment in growth initiatives signal positive short-term momentum. The optimistic management tone and maintained guidance are likely to bolster investor confidence.
