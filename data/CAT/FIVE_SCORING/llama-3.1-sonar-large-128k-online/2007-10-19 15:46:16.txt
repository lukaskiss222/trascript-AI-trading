The Caterpillar Inc. third-quarter 2007 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Record Sales and Profit**: The company reported its best third quarter ever in terms of sales and revenues, and its second-best quarter of any in history for profit per share.
- **Global Growth**: Strong sales growth was seen outside of North America, particularly in Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Latin America, driven by key end markets like mining, oil and gas, and electric power generation.
- **Price Realization**: The company experienced better price realization, with a $267 million increase in the quarter, which is significant compared to previous quarters.
- **Cash Flow**: Year-to-date Machinery and Engines operating cash flow improved by about $250 million from the same period last year.

### Negative Factors:
- **Cost Increases**: Core operating costs rose more than expected, with a $294 million increase, primarily due to higher material costs and other factory costs.
- **Currency Impact**: The company faced a negative impact from currency fluctuations, particularly due to a weakening dollar against the UK pound, resulting in a $60 million hit to profit before tax.
- **U.S. Market Weakness**: Sales and revenues in North America were down 11%, driven by a weak U.S. housing market, non-residential construction, coal mining, quarrying, and on-highway truck engines.
- **Inventory Reductions**: North American dealers reduced inventories significantly, which negatively impacted sales.

### Guidance and Outlook:
- **2008 Outlook**: Despite a weak U.S. economic picture, the company expects another year of record results with sales and revenues growth of 5% to 10% and profit per share growth of 5% to 15%.
- **Cost Management**: The company is working to manage costs and implement the Cat Production System, but these efforts are still in progress and may not yield immediate benefits.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on Caterpillar's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The strong global sales and profit performance, coupled with a solid cash flow position, offset some of the negative impacts from cost increases and U.S. market weakness. However, the uncertainty around cost management and the ongoing challenges in the U.S. market may temper immediate stock price gains.
