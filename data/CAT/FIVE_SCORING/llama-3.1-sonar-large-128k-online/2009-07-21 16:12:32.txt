The Caterpillar Inc. Q2 2009 earnings call transcript reveals several key points that suggest a mixed but generally challenging short-term outlook for the company's stock.

### Key Points:
1. **Significant Sales and Revenue Decline**: Sales and revenues dropped by 41% compared to the second quarter of 2008, largely due to weak end-user demand and dealer inventory reductions[6}.
2. **Profit Impact**: Despite cost-cutting measures, profit per share was down substantially, and the company anticipates a very tough third quarter with significant rolling factory shut downs and potential for near-break-even or even negative profits in the third quarter.
3. **Inventory and Dealer Dynamics**: Dealers are expected to continue reducing inventories, especially in the third quarter, which will further impact sales and profit in the short term.
4. **Cost Reductions and Efficiency**: The company has made significant strides in reducing variable and period costs, but these efforts are somewhat offset by the severe decline in sales volume.
5. **Liquidity and Cash Flow**: Caterpillar is in a strong liquidity position, but the cash flow benefits are partly due to inventory reductions and lower payables, which may not be sustainable as a long-term strategy.

### Short-Term Impact on Stock:
Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the ongoing economic challenges, significant declines in sales and profit, and the anticipated tough third quarter. While the company's cost-cutting measures and liquidity position are positives, they may not immediately offset the negative impacts of reduced sales and profits.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to experience a negative impact in the short term due to the company's challenging earnings outlook and ongoing economic uncertainties.
