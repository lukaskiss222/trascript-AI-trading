The Caterpillar Inc. earnings call for the fourth quarter and full year of 2008 paints a picture of significant challenges and proactive measures to address them. Here are the key points that will likely influence the stock price in the short term:

- **Sharp Decline in Expectations for 2009**: Caterpillar has reduced its sales and revenue outlook for 2009 to around $40 billion, a significant drop from the $51.3 billion in 2008. This reduction, coupled with expected lower commodity prices, indicates a tough year ahead.
- **Cost-Cutting Measures**: The company is taking aggressive actions to reduce costs, including layoffs, production cuts, and reductions in SG&A and R&D expenses. While these measures are necessary, they will take time to show their full impact, particularly in the first quarter.
- **First Quarter Expectations**: The first quarter is expected to be particularly weak, with possible losses due to the lag in implementing cost reductions and the impact of redundancy costs.
- **Material Costs and Pricing**: Despite expectations of lower material costs in 2009, the pricing environment remains challenging due to declining demand and used equipment prices.
- **Balance Sheet and Dividend**: The company is managing its balance sheet closely, with a focus on cash flow and pension funding. The dividend payout ratio is expected to be higher in 2009 but is still considered manageable.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lowered guidance, significant cost-cutting measures, and the challenging economic outlook.
