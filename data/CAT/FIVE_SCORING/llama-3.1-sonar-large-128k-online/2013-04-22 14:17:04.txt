The Caterpillar Inc. Q1 2013 earnings call highlights several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the company's stock.

### Key Points
1. **Revenue and Profit Decline**: Caterpillar reported a significant decline in sales and revenues, down 17% from the first quarter of 2012, and a corresponding drop in profit per share from $2.37 to $1.31. This decline was largely due to dealer inventory reductions and lower end-user demand[1][3].
2. **Revised Outlook**: The company revised its 2013 sales and revenues outlook downward to a range of $57 to $61 billion, with a profit per share of about $7.00 at the middle of this range. This is a reduction from the previous guidance of $60 to $68 billion and $7.00 to $9.00 per share[1][3].
3. **Mining Segment Challenges**: The mining segment is facing substantial challenges, with sales of traditional mining machines expected to be down about 50% from 2012 and Bucyrus mining machines down about 15%. This segment's underperformance is a major contributor to the overall revenue and profit decline[1][3].
4. **Inventory Reduction and Cash Flow**: Despite lower profits, Caterpillar improved its operating cash flow significantly due to inventory reductions. The company plans to continue reducing inventory but will increase production levels in the second quarter[1][3].
5. **Share Repurchase**: Caterpillar announced a $1 billion share repurchase program, reflecting their strong balance sheet and improved cash flow. This move is seen as an opportunistic use of cash given the current stock price[1][3].
6. **Economic and Market Conditions**: The company noted that while economic conditions are stable, growth is slow. There are mixed signals from different regions, with some positive indicators like the Bauma show in Europe but ongoing challenges in other areas[1][3].

### Implications for Stock Price
Given these points, the short-term impact on Caterpillar's stock price is likely to be negative due to:
- The significant decline in sales and profits.
- The downward revision of the 2013 outlook.
- Continued challenges in the mining segment.
- Despite the positive aspects of improved cash flow and share repurchase, the overall sentiment from the earnings call is cautious due to the macroeconomic and sector-specific challenges.

However, the share repurchase announcement and the company's strong balance sheet could mitigate some of the negative impact.
