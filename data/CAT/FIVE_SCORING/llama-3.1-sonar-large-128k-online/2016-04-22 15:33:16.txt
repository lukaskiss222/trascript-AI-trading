Caterpillar's first-quarter 2016 earnings call highlighted several key points that are likely to influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Lowered Guidance**: The company reduced its 2016 sales and revenues outlook from a range of $40-$44 billion to $40-$42 billion, and profit per share was adjusted downward from $3.50 to $3.00. This reduction, largely due to weaker-than-expected sales in Energy & Transportation and Resource Industries, is a negative indicator[1].

2. **Challenging Markets**: The company faces continued pressure in several key markets, including mining, oil and gas, and rail, which are expected to remain challenging. This ongoing weakness could maintain downward pressure on the stock[1][2].

3. **Cost Reductions and Operational Performance**: Despite the challenging market conditions, Caterpillar has made significant progress in cost reduction and operational performance. However, these positive factors may not immediately offset the negative impact of lower sales and profits in the short term[1].

4. **Positive Signs in Some Areas**: There are some positive signals, such as improvements in China's construction industry and stability in European construction, but these are not robust enough to immediately counterbalance the broader market challenges[1].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lowered guidance, ongoing market challenges, and the general economic environment.

**Rating: -1**
