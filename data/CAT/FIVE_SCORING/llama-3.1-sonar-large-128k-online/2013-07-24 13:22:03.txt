The Caterpillar Inc. earnings call transcript reveals several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Lowered Outlook**: The company reduced its 2013 sales and profit outlook due to significant dealer inventory reductions, lower end-user demand, and inventory absorption costs. This reduction in outlook is likely to be a short-term negative factor for the stock.

2. **Dealer Inventory**: The expectation of continued dealer inventory reductions in the second half of 2013, although at a slower pace, suggests ongoing pressure on sales. However, the end of these reductions could lead to a positive impact on sales in the future, but this is more of a long-term consideration.

3. **Cost Reductions**: The company is taking additional cost-cutting measures, which could help stabilize margins and improve profitability. However, the immediate impact of these actions may not be fully realized in the short term.

4. **Segment Performance**: While the Power Systems segment performed well, the Resource Industries segment, particularly mining, faced significant challenges. The diversified nature of Caterpillar's business helps mitigate some of these impacts, but the mining sector's woes could continue to weigh on the stock in the near term.

5. **Cash Flow and Share Buybacks**: The strong operating cash flow and continued share repurchases are positive signals, indicating the company's financial health and commitment to shareholder value. This could provide some support to the stock price.

Given these points, the short-term outlook for Caterpillar's stock is likely to be influenced negatively by the lowered outlook and ongoing dealer inventory reductions, despite the positive aspects of cost-cutting measures and strong cash flow.
