The earnings call for Caterpillar Inc. for the full-year and fourth quarter of 2012 presents a mixed picture that is likely to have both positive and negative short-term implications for the stock.

### Positive Aspects:
- Despite global economic uncertainties, Caterpillar reported record sales and revenues of $65.9 billion for 2012, a 10% increase from 2011, and a record profit per share of $8.48, up 15% from the previous year[1][4][5].
- The company successfully reduced inventory by $2 billion in the fourth quarter, exceeding their goal, which is a positive sign of efficient management[1][4].

### Negative Aspects:
- The fourth-quarter sales and revenues were down by $1.168 billion (7% decrease) compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, largely due to reduced dealer inventories and lower production levels. This had a significant negative impact on fourth-quarter profit[1][4][5].
- The fourth-quarter profit was also negatively affected by a goodwill impairment charge of $580 million related to the Siwei acquisition[1][4].

### Management's Tone and Guidance:
- Management expressed satisfaction with the overall performance but acknowledged the challenges faced due to economic slowdowns and inventory adjustments. They are cautious about the immediate future, indicating continued reduced production levels at least through the first quarter of 2013[1][4].

### Conclusion:
Given the mixed results, with record annual performance but weak fourth-quarter metrics due to inventory adjustments and a significant goodwill impairment charge, the stock is likely to experience short-term volatility. However, the successful inventory reduction and long-term growth prospects might mitigate some of the negative impact.
