The Caterpillar Inc. earnings transcript for the year-end 2014 and the 2015 outlook presents several key points that will likely influence the stock's performance in the short term:

1. **Negative 2015 Outlook**: The company expects a significant decline in sales and revenues for 2015, largely due to the substantial drop in oil and gas prices, weaker commodity prices, and a stronger dollar. This decline is anticipated to be around 9% compared to 2014, which is a major headwind.

2. **Impact of Oil and Gas**: The drop in oil prices is expected to heavily impact the drilling and well servicing segments, with significant reductions in order rates and sales expected in the second half of 2015. This sector is critical to Caterpillar's energy and transportation segment.

3. **Global Economic Conditions**: The company faces challenging global economic conditions, including weak mining, lower construction demand in Europe and China, and a stronger dollar that will negatively impact sales but positively impact costs.

4. **Restructuring and Cost Management**: Caterpillar plans to continue restructuring efforts in 2015, although at a lower cost than in 2014. The company also expects benefits from lower incentive compensation, favorable variable manufacturing costs, and a positive impact from the stronger dollar on costs.

5. **Investor Sentiment**: The tone from management is cautious, reflecting the difficult industry and economic environment. While they highlight some positive aspects like improved inventory management and R&D investments, the overall outlook is more negative than previously anticipated.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lowered guidance, significant expected declines in key segments, and the overall negative outlook for 2015.
