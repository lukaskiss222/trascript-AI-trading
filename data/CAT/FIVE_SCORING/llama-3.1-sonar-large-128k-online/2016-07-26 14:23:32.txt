The transcript for Caterpillar Inc.'s 2Q 2016 earnings call reveals several key points that will likely influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Sales and Revenue Decline**: Caterpillar reported a 16% decline in sales and revenues compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to weak commodity prices, economic slowdown in developing countries, and significant declines in the Energy & Transportation and Resource Industries segments[1][2][4].

2. **Cost Reduction and Operational Performance**: Despite the revenue decline, Caterpillar has successfully reduced costs, with over $1.1 billion in cost savings year-to-date and an expected total of over $2 billion for the full year. This has helped mitigate the impact of lower sales volumes[1][2][4].

3. **Revised Outlook**: The company revised its full-year outlook, lowering sales and revenue expectations to a range of $40 to $40.5 billion and reducing profit per share estimates to $2.75, or $3.55 excluding restructuring costs. This revision is partly due to global economic uncertainties, including Brexit and commodity price instability[1][2][4].

4. **Dealer Inventory and End-User Demand**: Dealer inventories are expected to decline significantly in the second half of the year, which could impact sales, but end-user demand is expected to remain relatively steady. The company's improved delivery performance is also contributing to lower dealer inventory levels[1][4].

5. **Macro and Industry Challenges**: The company continues to face challenges in key industries such as mining, oil and gas, and rail, with no clear signs of recovery. However, there are some positive signs in aftermarket activities and certain regional markets like China[1][4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the following factors:

- The decline in sales and revenues
- The revised and lower full-year outlook
- Continuing challenges in key industries
- Expected decline in dealer inventories, which could affect sales

However, the strong cost reduction efforts and improved operational performance may mitigate some of the negative impacts.
