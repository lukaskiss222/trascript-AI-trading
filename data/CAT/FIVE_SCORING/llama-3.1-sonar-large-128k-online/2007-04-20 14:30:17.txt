Caterpillar's Q1 2007 earnings call presented a mixed but generally positive outlook. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Global Performance**: Despite weaknesses in the US construction and on-highway truck markets, Caterpillar reported its best first quarter ever in terms of sales and revenues, driven by robust sales outside North America, particularly in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.
- **Guidance Increase**: The company raised its sales and profit outlook for 2007, indicating confidence in its global diversification and cost control measures.
- **Cost Management**: Effective cost reduction initiatives, especially in areas like truck engines and building construction products, were highlighted, although some cost pressures from materials and geographic mix were noted.
- **Inventory Management**: The company is actively managing dealer inventory levels, which affected sales but is part of a broader strategy to align inventory with demand.
- **Currency Impact**: While currency fluctuations had a positive impact on sales, they were offset by similar negative impacts on costs, suggesting a balanced position.

Given these points, the short-term outlook for Caterpillar's stock is likely positive due to the company's strong global performance, improved guidance, and effective cost management. However, the challenges in the US construction and truck markets might temper some of the immediate upside.
