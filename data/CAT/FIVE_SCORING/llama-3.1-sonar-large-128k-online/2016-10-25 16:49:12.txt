The Caterpillar Inc. third-quarter 2016 earnings call revealed several key points that indicate a challenging but managed environment for the company. Here are the main implications for the short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Revenue and Profit Decline**: Sales and revenues were down 16% from the third quarter of 2015, and profit per share decreased significantly, partly due to higher restructuring costs and unfavorable price realization[2][3].
- **Cost Reductions**: Despite the sales decline, Caterpillar has made significant progress in cost reduction, particularly in variable manufacturing costs, material costs, and period costs. This has helped mitigate some of the negative impact of lower sales[2][3].
- **2017 Outlook**: The company does not expect 2017 to be significantly different from 2016, with caution expressed about the first half of the year. There are hopes for improvement in the second half, contingent on commodity prices and economic conditions[2][3].
- **Dealer Inventory and Production**: Dealer inventory reductions are expected to continue into 2017, although at a slower pace than in 2016. This suggests that production will still be below retail demand levels[2][3].
- **Pricing Environment**: The pricing environment is expected to remain stable but not improve significantly, which continues to be a negative factor[2][3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lowered 2016 guidance, ongoing weak market conditions, and the cautious outlook for 2017.
