The earnings transcript for Caterpillar Inc. reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Lower Than Expected Sales and End User Demand**: Caterpillar reported an 8% decline in fourth-quarter sales and revenues, and a 2% decline for the full year, driven by lower end user demand and dealer inventory reductions. This weaker-than-expected performance could lead to short-term pressure on the stock.

2. **Guidance for 2020**: The company provided a profit per share outlook for 2020 in the range of $8.50 to $10.00, which is lower than the adjusted profit per share of $11.06 in 2019. This reduced guidance, combined with expectations of lower end user demand and dealer inventory reductions, may contribute to short-term volatility.

3. **Cost Control and Efficiency**: Despite the challenges, Caterpillar highlighted strong cost control and operational excellence, achieving their best safety performance on record and maintaining a solid operating margin. These positives could mitigate some of the negative impacts but may not fully offset the concerns around lower demand and sales.

4. **Market Uncertainties**: The company is navigating a fluid global economic environment, including the impact of the coronavirus, trade tensions, and other market uncertainties. These factors add to the uncertainty and could influence investor sentiment negatively in the short term.

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lower guidance, weaker end user demand, and inventory adjustments.
