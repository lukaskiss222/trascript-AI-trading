The Caterpillar Inc. Q1 2009 earnings call reveals several key points that indicate a challenging but managed short-term outlook:

1. **Significant Sales and Revenue Decline**: Sales and revenues were down 22% from the first quarter of 2008, largely due to lower machinery and engine volumes, as well as negative currency impacts.

2. **Cost Reduction and Inventory Management**: The company has aggressively reduced production, inventory, and costs to align with lower demand. This includes a $789 million reduction in inventory and significant cuts in overhead and SG&A expenses.

3. **Redundancy Costs**: The company incurred $558 million in redundancy costs in the first quarter, with a total expected cost of about $700 million for the year, reflecting the impact on employment.

4. **Price Realization**: Despite economic challenges, Caterpillar maintained positive price realization, partially offsetting the decline in sales volume.

5. **Financial Products**: Cat Financial's performance was impacted by lower interest rates and increased past dues and credit losses, though the company maintained liquidity and managed its asset portfolio effectively.

6. **Outlook**: The company lowered its full-year sales and revenue outlook to $35 billion, plus or minus 10%, with profit expectations of $1.25 per share, excluding redundancy costs. There is a sense that 2009 might be the trough year, with potential for recovery in subsequent years.

Given these points:

- The immediate short-term impact is likely negative due to the significant decline in sales and revenues, increased redundancy costs, and challenges in Financial Products.
- However, the company's proactive cost-cutting measures, effective inventory management, and maintained price realization suggest a managed approach to the economic downturn.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lowered guidance, significant sales decline, and redundancy costs, but the company's strategic actions and positive signs in certain segments suggest stability.
