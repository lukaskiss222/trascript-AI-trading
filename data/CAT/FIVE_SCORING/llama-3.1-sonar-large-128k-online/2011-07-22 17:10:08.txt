The earnings call for Caterpillar Inc. presents several key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Caterpillar reported record-breaking sales and revenues for the second quarter of 2011, with a 37% increase from the same period in 2010. This strong performance is likely to be positively received by investors[1].

2. **Bucyrus Acquisition**: The acquisition of Bucyrus is expected to bring significant long-term benefits, including expanded product lines, increased market presence, and cost synergies. However, there are upfront integration costs and some short-term negative impacts on profit, which might temper immediate enthusiasm[5].

3. **Guidance Update**: The company raised its 2011 sales and revenue outlook, excluding Bucyrus impacts, which is a positive sign. However, the inclusion of Bucyrus-related costs reduces the profit outlook for 2011, introducing some near-term uncertainty[5].

4. **Cash Flow and Financial Health**: Caterpillar reported strong operating cash flow, which is a positive indicator of its financial health and ability to fund its growth strategies without issuing new equity[1].

5. **Management Confidence and Strategic Alignment**: The management team expressed confidence in the long-term strategy, particularly in the mining sector, and outlined a clear plan for integrating Bucyrus. This confidence can reassure investors about the company's direction[5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive but potentially muted reaction in the short term due to the balance between strong current performance and the short-term costs associated with the Bucyrus acquisition.
