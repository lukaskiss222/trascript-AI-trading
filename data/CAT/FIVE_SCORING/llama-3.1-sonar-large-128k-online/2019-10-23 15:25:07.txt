The Caterpillar Inc. Q3 2019 earnings call revealed several key points that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

1. **Lowered Guidance**: Caterpillar lowered its full-year profit per share guidance to $10.90-$11.40, down from the previous range of $12.06-$13.06. This reduction is primarily due to dealers reducing their inventories and lower-than-expected end-user demand, driven by global economic uncertainty[1][2][4].

2. **Inventory Reductions**: Dealers are expected to reduce their inventories further in the fourth quarter, which will impact sales and revenues. This inventory reduction is a significant factor in the lowered guidance and indicates caution among dealers and end-users[1][2][4].

3. **End-User Demand**: The company expects end-user demand to be flat in the fourth quarter, which is a downgrade from previous expectations of a 4% increase. This reflects broader economic uncertainty and caution among customers[1][2][4].

4. **Operational and Financial Health**: Despite the challenges, Caterpillar maintained its operating profit margin and is taking steps to manage production and reduce costs. The company also highlighted strong cash flow, significant share repurchases, and a commitment to increasing dividends[1][2][4].

Given these points, the short-term outlook for Caterpillar's stock is likely to be negative due to the lowered guidance, inventory reductions, and cautious end-user demand. These factors suggest that investors may react negatively to the increased uncertainty and reduced expectations.
