The Caterpillar Inc. earnings transcript for the first quarter of 2008 presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Record Sales and Profit**: The company reported record sales and revenues, as well as the best first quarter ever for profit per share and financial products business[6>.
- **Strong Growth Outside North America**: Sales and revenues outside North America were up significantly, driven by growth in emerging markets, particularly in the Asia Pacific, CIS, Africa, and Middle East regions.
- **Price Realization and Cost Management**: Despite higher material costs, the company managed to maintain a positive price-cost relationship, especially in the engine segment, and announced mid-year price increases to offset future cost increases.

### Negative Factors:
- **Weakening North American Market**: The outlook for North America has been revised downward, with weaker dealer sales to end users and a decline in non-residential construction.
- **Currency and Cost Impacts**: The weaker dollar had a negative impact on operating margins, and higher material costs, particularly steel, are expected to continue throughout the year.
- **Margin Pressure**: The operating profit margin was negatively affected by product mix, currency impacts, and higher costs, leading to lower-than-expected incremental margins.

### Conclusion:
Given the strong performance outside North America and the company's ability to manage costs and maintain positive price realization, but also considering the weakening North American market and the negative impacts of currency and higher material costs, the stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility. However, the overall outlook, while cautious, does not suggest a significant downward revision in full-year guidance.
