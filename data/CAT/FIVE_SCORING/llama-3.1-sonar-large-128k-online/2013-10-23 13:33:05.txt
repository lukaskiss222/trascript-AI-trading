The Caterpillar Inc. Q3 2013 earnings call revealed several key points that indicate a challenging environment for the company, particularly in the short term:

- **Sales and Revenue Decline**: Significant declines in sales and revenues, especially in the Resource Industries segment (primarily mining), with a 42% drop in mining sales compared to the third quarter of 2012. This has led to a revised 2013 outlook with lower sales and profit expectations[1][3][4].

- **Cost Cutting and Efficiency**: Despite the sales decline, the company has implemented substantial cost-cutting measures, including temporary plant shutdowns, workforce reductions, and austerity measures. These actions have helped mitigate the impact on profit, with a decremental operating profit pull-through close to 30%[1][3][4].

- **Future Outlook**: The 2014 sales and revenues outlook is flat with 2013, with a plus or minus 5% range. There are expectations of further declines in mining equipment demand but some stability in Construction and Power Systems segments. The company is cautious due to ongoing economic uncertainties, including U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, Eurozone health, and China's economic transition[1][3][4].

- **Cash Flow and Balance Sheet**: Despite the challenging year, the company has had a strong year for cash flow, enabling improvements in the balance sheet, stock repurchases, and a raised quarterly dividend[1][3][4].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to:

- Lowered 2013 and flat 2014 sales and revenue outlooks.
- Continued decline in high-margin mining sales.
- Economic uncertainties affecting global growth.

However, the strong cash flow, cost-cutting measures, and improvements in the balance sheet may mitigate some of the negative impact.
