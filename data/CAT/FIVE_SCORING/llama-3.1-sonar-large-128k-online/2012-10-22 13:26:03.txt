The Caterpillar Inc. Q3 2012 earnings transcript reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks).

- **Lowered 2012 Outlook**: The company reduced its full-year sales and revenue outlook to $66 billion from a previous range of $68-$70 billion, and lowered the profit outlook to $9-$9.25 per share from $9.60 per share. This reduction is largely due to lower end-user demand and dealer inventory adjustments[1][3].

- **Inventory and Production Adjustments**: Caterpillar is reducing production levels to align with lower demand and to work off excess dealer inventory. This will result in lower sales in the fourth quarter and into 2013, which could lead to short-term volatility in the stock price[1][3].

- **Mixed Economic Outlook**: The company does not anticipate a significant improvement in global economic growth in 2013, projecting only a modest 2.7% global economic growth. This cautious outlook might dampen investor enthusiasm[1][3].

- **Segment Performance**: While mining sales were up 13% in the third quarter, the outlook for 2013 indicates a decline in mining equipment sales due to lower metals and coal prices and increased operating costs. However, construction equipment sales are expected to improve, particularly in the U.S. and China, which could offer some balance[1][3].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the lowered outlook, inventory adjustments, and cautious economic projections.
