The Caterpillar Inc. second-quarter 2007 earnings transcript reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

- **Mixed Top-Line Performance**: Despite facing significant headwinds in North America, Caterpillar reported a 7% increase in sales and revenues, driven by strong growth outside of North America. However, this growth was partially offset by declines in North American sales, particularly in the on-highway truck engine segment and housing-related markets[4].

- **Profit Disappointment**: Profit per share was lower than expected and last year's record levels, primarily due to higher material costs, production and supply chain inefficiencies, and the impact of new emissions requirements on truck engine sales. The company acknowledged these issues were more severe than anticipated[4].

- **Inventory Management**: The reduction in North American dealer inventories by $800 million during the quarter, while beneficial for long-term efficiency, had a short-term negative impact on earnings. However, the company expects less inventory reduction impact in the second half of 2007 and into 2008[4].

- **Guidance and Outlook**: Caterpillar maintained its full-year sales and revenue outlook at about $44 billion but cautioned about higher core operating costs. The company expressed confidence in the strength of markets outside the U.S., particularly in global mining, oil and gas, and other key sectors[4].

Given these factors:

- The profit disappointment and higher-than-expected costs could lead to short-term investor skepticism.
- However, the strong growth outside North America and the company's long-term strategic initiatives, such as the CAT Production System, suggest potential for future improvement.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lower-than-expected profit and higher costs, but the strong global sales and long-term strategic initiatives may mitigate some of this impact.

**Rating:**
