The Q1 2020 earnings call for Caterpillar Inc. revealed several key points that indicate a challenging short-term outlook but a strong long-term strategy.

### Key Points:
- **Sales and Revenue Decline**: Caterpillar reported a 21% decrease in sales and revenues, driven by lower end-user demand and changes in dealer inventories. This decline was more pronounced in Asia-Pacific and North America[2][3][5].
- **Profit Margin and Cash Flow**: Operating profit margin decreased by 320 basis points to 13.2%, and profit per share declined by 39%. Despite this, the company maintained a strong cash position and liquidity[2][3][5].
- **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic has created significant operational challenges, including supply chain disruptions and facility closures. However, the company has implemented various measures to mitigate these impacts and maintain operational efficiency[2][3][5].
- **Cost Reduction and Financial Position**: Caterpillar has taken actions to reduce discretionary expenses, suspended salary increases and short-term incentive compensation, and strengthened its financial position through bond issuances and additional credit facilities[2][3][5].
- **Guidance and Outlook**: The company withdrew its earnings guidance for 2020 due to the uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and does not expect to provide guidance until the situation becomes clearer[2][3][5].

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the significant decline in sales and revenues, coupled with the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global demand and operations, Caterpillar's stock is likely to face short-term pressure. The lack of guidance for 2020 and the expectation that the second quarter will be weaker than the first quarter further contribute to this negative short-term outlook.

### Conclusion:
The combination of reduced sales, lower profit margins, and the uncertain economic environment due to COVID-19 suggests a negative short-term impact on the stock price.
