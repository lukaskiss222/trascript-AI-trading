Caterpillar Inc.'s second-quarter 2008 earnings call highlighted several key points that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Quarterly Performance**: Despite weaknesses in North America and Europe, Caterpillar reported an all-time record quarter for sales, revenues, and profit per share. This strong performance is likely to positively impact the stock.

2. **Geographic Growth**: The company saw significant growth in emerging markets, particularly in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and parts of EMEA, which offsets the decline in North America and Western Europe.

3. **Cost and Pricing Dynamics**: While material and freight costs are increasing, the company is managing these through price realization and efficiency improvements. The announcement of a 5-7% price increase for 2009 indicates confidence in maintaining profitability despite cost pressures.

4. **Capacity Constraints and Future Growth**: Caterpillar is investing in capacity expansion, particularly in emerging markets, which should support future growth. However, current capacity constraints limit the immediate upside.

5. **Financial Services Stability**: Despite some softening in North America, Cat Financial is managing well, with low write-offs and good access to funding.

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong quarterly performance, continued growth in emerging markets, and proactive management of costs and pricing.
