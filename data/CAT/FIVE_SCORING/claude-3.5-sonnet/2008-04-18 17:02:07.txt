Based on this earnings call transcript, I assess that the stock is likely to have a positive impact over the next 1-2 weeks, though not dramatically positive. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong Q1 Results:
- Record Q1 sales and revenues up 18%
- Strong international growth offsetting NA weakness
- Best Q1 ever for financial products business

2. Forward Outlook:
- Maintained full year guidance despite economic uncertainties
- Strong backlog and capacity-constrained on many products
- Mid-year price increases announced to offset cost pressures

3. Mixed Factors:
- North American weakness worse than expected
- Some margin pressure due to costs/mix
- Currency headwinds

While there are some concerns, the overall tone was confident with strong fundamental demand, especially internationally. The maintenance of guidance despite Q1 outperformance suggests some conservatism. The supply constraints indicate continued strong demand.
