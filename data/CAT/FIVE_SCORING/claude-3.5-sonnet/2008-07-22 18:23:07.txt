Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis:

Main points supporting my rating:
- Record Q2 results with revenues up 20% and EPS up 40% YoY
- Strong international growth offsetting NA weakness (60% of sales now outside NA)
- Management reaffirmed 2010 EPS target of $8-10 despite challenges
- Pricing power demonstrated with 5-7% increase announced for 2009
- Order backlog remains robust, particularly in mining/energy sectors

However, some concerning factors:
- Second half guidance implies earnings decline vs prior year
- Weakening conditions in Western Europe joining NA weakness
- Rising material/freight costs creating margin pressure
- Heavy production constraints limiting growth potential
- Financial services seeing some deterioration in credit metrics

On balance, I believe the strong Q2 results, pricing power, and management's confident long-term outlook outweigh the near-term headwinds. The stock should respond positively in the 1-2 week timeframe as investors focus on the company's ability to deliver solid results despite macro challenges.
