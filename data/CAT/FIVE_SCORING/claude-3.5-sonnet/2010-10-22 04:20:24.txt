Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Caterpillar's stock:

Positive factors:
- Strong Q3 results with sales up 53% and profits up 96% year-over-year
- Raised full year 2010 guidance
- Preliminary 2011 revenue guidance of ~$50B shows continued growth
- Improving operational efficiency and manufacturing execution
- Strong mining demand and capacity expansions underway

Negative/cautionary factors:
- Machine vs Engine mix shift could pressure margins
- Some capacity constraints in mining
- Weak recoveries in developed markets
- Material costs trending up
- Conservative 2011 growth outlook vs market expectations

Conclusion:
While there are some mixed signals, the overall tone is positive with strong current performance, raised guidance, and operational improvements. Management struck an optimistic but measured tone about future growth. The results and outlook should drive modest near-term stock appreciation.
