Based on the earnings transcript, here's my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) stock impact:

Key negatives:
- Q2 profit missed expectations significantly ($1.24 vs $1.49 consensus)
- Manufacturing costs were higher than expected
- North American business remains weak with inventory reductions
- Supply chain disruptions and inefficiencies impacted margins
- Some production ramp-up issues with new products

Key positives:
- Full-year guidance maintained despite Q2 miss
- Strong international growth (up 27% outside North America)
- Management expects cost improvements in second half
- Order books strong in international markets
- Active inventory management should position better for future

While management maintained full-year guidance, the significant Q2 earnings miss and multiple operational challenges will likely pressure the stock in the near-term. The market typically reacts negatively to earnings misses of this magnitude, even with maintained guidance. The company's execution issues and higher costs will likely create skepticism until improvement is demonstrated.
