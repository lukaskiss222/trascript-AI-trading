Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive short-term impact on Caterpillar's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following reasons:

- Strong operational execution despite severe revenue declines, with better-than-expected cost control and margins
- Management indicated improving trends in parts demand and utilization rates, suggesting potential bottom formation
- 2010 revenue guidance of +10-25% growth was higher than analysts expected
- Company appears well-positioned for eventual recovery with maintained dealer network and supply chain readiness

However, near-term headwinds remain including continued dealer inventory reductions and weak end markets.
