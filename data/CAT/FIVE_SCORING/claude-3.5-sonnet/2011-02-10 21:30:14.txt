Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Caterpillar's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong Q4 2010 results with revenue up 62% and profits quadrupling year-over-year
2. Raised 2011 guidance above $50B in revenue and ~$6 EPS
3. Management confidently reaffirmed their 2012 targets of $8-10 EPS
4. Positive commentary on mining demand, dealer restocking needs, and emerging markets growth
5. Successful integration and better-than-expected performance of EMD acquisition

While there are some headwinds like negative mix and capacity constraints, the overall tone was quite optimistic and results/guidance exceeded expectations. Management's confidence in both near-term execution and long-term targets should drive positive sentiment.
