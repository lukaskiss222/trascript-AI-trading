Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly positive short-term impact on Caterpillar's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. The company beat Q1 earnings expectations ($0.39 vs $0.04 consensus) despite challenging conditions and maintained profitability excluding redundancy costs.

2. Management indicated April showed the first signs of stabilization in orders after months of declines, and expressed cautious optimism that 2009 could mark the bottom.

3. While guidance was lowered, the company is aggressively cutting costs, reducing inventory, and maintaining price discipline - demonstrating strong execution in a difficult environment.

However, the positive impact is likely to be modest given ongoing economic uncertainties and the reduced full-year guidance.
