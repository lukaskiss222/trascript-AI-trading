Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Caterpillar's likely short-term stock impact:

Positive factors:
- Record Q1 sales/revenues and EPS despite US housing/truck weakness
- Strong international growth (Europe/Africa/Middle East +36%, Asia-Pacific +22%, Latin America +15%)
- Raised full-year guidance for both revenue and EPS
- Healthy diversification across geographies and end markets

Concerning factors:
- Weaker US outlook (GDP forecast cut from 2.5% to 2%)
- Higher warranty costs and inventory buildup
- Tough Q2 comparisons expected
- Some pressure on pricing due to geographic mix

Overall, while there are some headwinds in North America, Caterpillar's strong international performance, raised guidance, and demonstrated ability to offset regional weakness through global diversification suggests the stock should react positively in the near-term. The market is likely to focus on the improved outlook and robust growth outside the US.
