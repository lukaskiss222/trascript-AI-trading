Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Caterpillar's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key supporting factors include:

1. Record Q4 results with highest-ever quarterly sales ($17.2B) and EPS ($2.32), exceeding expectations

2. Raised 2012 guidance significantly with $68-72B revenue outlook, $3B above previous midpoint

3. Strong order backlog up 37% YoY to nearly $30B

4. Management's confident tone on mining demand, pricing power, and operational improvements

5. Success in cost controls and productivity gains through Cat Production System

While there are some potential headwinds (tax rate increase, Europe uncertainty), the overall tone was very positive with strong fundamentals and momentum heading into 2012.
