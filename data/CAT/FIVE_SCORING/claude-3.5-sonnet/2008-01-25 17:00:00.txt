Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Caterpillar's stock price. Despite some operational challenges, management delivered strong results with record Q4 sales, maintained their positive 2008 guidance, and demonstrated the company's successful geographic diversification with 60% of sales now outside North America. The company's ability to achieve record profits despite U.S. housing and truck engine market weakness shows resilience. While there are some concerns around manufacturing costs and efficiency improvements, the strong order backlog (up 20%) and continued international growth momentum should support the stock in the near term.
