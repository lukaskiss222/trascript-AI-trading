Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Caterpillar's short-term (1-2 weeks) stock price impact:

Key Positive Factors:
- Management taking aggressive cost reduction actions including 20,000 job cuts
- Clear plan to achieve $2.50 EPS target in 2009 (excluding redundancy costs)
- Strong dealer network and alliance agreements helping maintain pricing

Key Negative Factors:
- Warning of potential Q1 loss and significantly reduced 2009 guidance
- 30% expected decline in machinery/engine volumes
- Continued pressure on commodity prices and mining segment
- Rising credit costs and balance sheet concerns

The market is likely to react negatively in the short-term due to the dramatic guidance cut, potential Q1 loss, and scale of headwinds facing the company. While management is taking appropriate actions, the near-term challenges and uncertainties will likely pressure the stock.
