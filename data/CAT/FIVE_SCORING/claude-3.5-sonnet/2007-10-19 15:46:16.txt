Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Caterpillar's stock:

While Caterpillar reported record quarterly revenues and their second-best quarterly profit ever, there are several concerning elements that will likely pressure the stock in the near-term:

1. Core operating costs increased significantly more than expected ($294M vs guidance), forcing them to lower full-year EPS guidance
2. The company is struggling to realize benefits from their Cat Production System implementation
3. Management was somewhat defensive about margins and costs while providing limited visibility into improvements for 2008
4. North American markets remain very weak with housing and truck markets expected to deteriorate further

While international growth remains robust and management expressed confidence in long-term targets, the cost control issues and lowered guidance will likely dominate near-term trading sentiment.
