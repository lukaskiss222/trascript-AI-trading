Based on my analysis of this earnings call transcript, here are the key points that would impact Caterpillar's stock price in the next 1-2 weeks:

Positive factors:
- Strong Q2 results with sales up 31% and profit up 91% year-over-year
- Raised full year guidance for both revenue and earnings
- Order backlog increased substantially to $15B from $10B at year-end
- Strong mining and emerging markets demand
- Improved manufacturing efficiency and cost controls

Concerns/Headwinds:
- Incentive compensation costs increased significantly 
- Mix shift to lower-margin products
- Currency headwinds from stronger USD
- Still depressed demand in developed markets
- Some capacity/supply chain constraints

Given that the company beat expectations, raised guidance, and showed strong operational execution despite some headwinds, this was overall a very positive earnings report. The increased backlog and mining strength also provide good visibility. While there are some offsetting factors, the positives outweigh the negatives.
