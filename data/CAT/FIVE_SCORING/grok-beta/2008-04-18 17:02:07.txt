Caterpillar reported strong Q1 2008 results amidst a challenging U.S. market, but their guidance for the full year reflects balanced growth with adjustments due to weakened domestic demand and increased costs in materials, particularly steel.

However, a significant drop is unlikely due to the solid international performance.
