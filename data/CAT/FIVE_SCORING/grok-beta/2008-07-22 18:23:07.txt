Caterpillar's Q2 earnings call provided a mixed outlook. The company reported a record-setting quarter, with strong sales and revenues driven mainly by growth in engine sales and the non-North American markets, especially in mining. However, the call conveyed concerns about the ongoing North American market weakness, an economic downturn in Western Europe, and potential material cost pressures heading into 2009, despite announced price increases. Management's confidence in the future growth outlook, bolstered by sustained global demand and operational improvements through the Cat Production System (CPS), suggests a likely positive impact, but this is tempered by immediate-term uncertainties.
