The Q1 2010 call for Caterpillar shows a rebound from economic downturn with a conservative sales forecast increase. The company managed to turn a profit and provide an optimistic outlook for 2010, with good prospects in the developing regions, mining sector, and after-market service parts. However, despite these positive signs, the lowered sales/revenues due to lower demand in key markets, potential pricing pressures from upcoming emissions regulations, and concerns about managing supply chain ramp-up and inventory levels suggest the stock might experience a more limited or delayed positive reaction in the very short-term.
