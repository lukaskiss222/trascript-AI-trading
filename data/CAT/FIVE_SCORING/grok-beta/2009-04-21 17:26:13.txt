Caterpillar's Q1 2009 earnings showed a significant impact from the global economic downturn, with lower machine sales volumes due to dealers reducing inventory, although the company maintained a profit excluding redundancy costs. Management's actions to reduce costs and align production with demand suggest a proactive approach that could mitigate further downside, but the focus on cutting inventories across the company and its supply chain could suggest ongoing pressure on sales, potentially causing a negative short-term reaction in the stock price.
