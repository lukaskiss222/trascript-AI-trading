Caterpillarâ€™s Q2 2010 earnings call indicated strong performance with a significant sales increase driven by improved end-user demand and no further dealer inventory reductions. However, a negative sales mix due to faster growth in lower-margin machinery and potential constraints in production capacity might limit the full realization of this demand, suggesting cautious optimism for the short term. This, along with the increased incentive compensation, points to a stock price that might experience some resistance while maintaining a positive trajectory.
