Caterpillarâ€™s earnings call reveals a dire outlook for 2009 with a projected 30% volume decline, significant job cuts, and lower earnings per share ($2.50) due to reduced dealer inventories and economic downturns. Despite these challenges, management's proactive measures, like reducing SG&A and R&D costs by 15%, indicate efforts to mitigate the impact, potentially stabilizing stock price in the short-term. However, investor concerns around earnings, dividend security, and Caterpillar's financial health might exert upward pressure initially due to cost-cutting measures, but weakened demand and cyclical concerns are likely to overshadow, leading to a potential short-term negative impact on the stock.
