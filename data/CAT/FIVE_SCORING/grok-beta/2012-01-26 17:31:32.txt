Caterpillar's Q4 and full-year results for 2011 were robust, achieving record sales and profits significantly surpassing 2008 levels due to operational improvements through their production system. However, several areas present short-term headwinds for the stock: increased R&D and CapEx expenses, potential tax rate hikes, and a normalizing of dealer inventory levels after substantial growth last year. While Caterpillar anticipates a 2012 revenue growth between 13-20% and a profit at the midpoint of $9.25 per share, the lack of quarterly guidance, expected first-quarter challenges, and the uncertain impact of selling distribution businesses to Finning might temper expectations for immediate stock price rallies. A slight positive impact is possible due to the overall positive outlook, global mining demand, and investments in capacity.
