Caterpillar's earnings call indicates a resilient, but somewhat tempered, outlook.  While adjusted operating profit margins exceeded expectations and EPS hit a record, sales were slightly below expectations, primarily due to lower-than-anticipated machine sales to users in the Construction Industries segment.  Strengthened performance in Energy & Transportation, driven by favorable pricing and robust power generation demand, is offsetting the weaker construction numbers in the short term, hinting at upward pressure on the stock price as the company's core business appears to be stronger than previously anticipated thanks to their diversification.
