Caterpillar's Q1 2016 earnings call highlighted a significant revenue decline, primarily driven by lower sales in Energy & Transportation and Construction segments.  While management highlighted ongoing cost-cutting measures and a strong balance sheet, the lowered guidance for sales and profits, due in part to a weaker-than-expected pricing environment and a negative impact from currency, suggests near-term negative pressure on the stock.  Overall, the macro cautious tone and the implied continued weakness in key sectors create a sense of uncertainty, likely leading to a negative short-term impact on the stock.
