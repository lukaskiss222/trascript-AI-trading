Caterpillar's earnings call highlighted a cautious outlook for 2020, citing lower end-user demand across all segments, particularly in Construction and Resource Industries.  While management emphasized operational excellence and cost-cutting, the projected decline in dealer inventory, combined with lower expectations for sales to end-users, points towards a challenging first half of the year. This will likely put downward pressure on the stock price in the coming weeks as investors digest the weaker-than-expected guidance.
