Caterpillar's earnings call highlighted strong sales growth (53% YoY) driven by improving global end-user demand, particularly in developing markets, and the absence of dealer inventory reductions from 2009.  Management raised full-year 2010 guidance for sales and profits, projecting stronger performance than initially expected.  The call also included a preliminary look at 2011 sales, estimating $50 billion, suggesting continued growth. This optimistic outlook, coupled with the focus on mature manufacturing improvements and the Lane strategy, implies favorable short-term implications for the stock.
