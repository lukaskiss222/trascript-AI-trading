Caterpillar's Q1 2007 earnings show robust sales growth outside North America, driven by strong performance in Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.  However, weakness in US housing and on-highway trucks, compounded by dealer inventory reductions, offset some of these gains.  Despite the headwinds, Caterpillar raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance, suggesting confidence in continued global growth and improved market conditions.
