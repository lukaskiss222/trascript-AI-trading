Caterpillar's earnings call highlights significant revenue declines in 2015, primarily due to lower demand, particularly in Energy & Transportation and Resource Industries segments.  Management anticipates continued challenges in 2016 with a lower sales forecast, but emphasizes cost-cutting measures and restructuring efforts to mitigate the impact on profits.  The company also projects a continuation of strong cash flow and a focus on protecting profitability and the balance sheet, suggesting the short-term outlook is likely negative, though with some potential for a stabilization in the second half of 2016.
