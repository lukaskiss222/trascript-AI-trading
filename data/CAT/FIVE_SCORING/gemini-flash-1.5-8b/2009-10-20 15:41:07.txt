Caterpillar's Q3 2009 earnings call highlighted continued weakness in end-user demand and dealer inventory reductions, impacting machinery and engine sales significantly.  Despite these challenges, the company achieved a better-than-expected profit due to cost-cutting measures, favorable manufacturing costs, and tax benefits.  Management expressed cautious optimism about 2010, projecting a sales increase but acknowledging that a full economic recovery is still uncertain.
