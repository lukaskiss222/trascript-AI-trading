Caterpillar's Q1 2015 earnings call highlighted a challenging environment, with revenue down due to a stronger dollar and lower volumes, primarily in Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.  Despite the global weakness, North America posted strong growth.  Management reiterated a 2015 revenue outlook of $50 billion, but stated that oil price declines are expected to be a key factor affecting both revenue and order backlog, particularly in the energy and transportation sector.  While profit per share improved compared to Q1 2014, management anticipates further pressure on margins in the second half of the year, primarily due to seasonal increases in discretionary costs and shifts in product mix.
