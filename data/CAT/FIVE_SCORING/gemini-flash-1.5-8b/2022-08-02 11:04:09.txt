Caterpillar's Q2 2022 earnings call showed strong demand, evidenced by the backlog increase and continued healthy order rates, but supply chain constraints continue to be a significant hurdle.  While price increases helped offset rising manufacturing costs,  lower-than-expected equipment sales to end users and some negative mix impacted margins.  The company anticipates volume and price improvements in the second half, but acknowledges continued challenges in the supply chain. This suggests a slightly positive yet tempered outlook for the next 1-2 weeks, potentially with some volatility as investors digest the nuanced performance details.
