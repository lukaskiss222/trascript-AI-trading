Caterpillar's Q2 2007 earnings reveal a complex picture.  While sales increased globally, driven by strong performance outside North America, profits fell short of expectations due to lower-than-anticipated North American machine sales, and significant cost pressures from the company's transition to the CAT production system.  Management acknowledges challenges in the U.S. housing market and on-highway truck engines, but expresses confidence in global growth and the long-term benefits of their production system. The short-term outlook could be negative as inventory adjustments continue, but the company is aiming for improvement in the second half of the year.
