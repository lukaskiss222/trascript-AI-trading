Caterpillar's 2Q 2019 earnings call revealed a strong top-line performance, driven by Construction and Resource Industries, but with concerns about dealer inventory levels and some negative mix shifts.  The management team expressed confidence in a modest sales growth trajectory for the year, even with some cautiousness from customers, but signaled a potential slower ramp-up in the mining sector and a fourth-quarter recovery in oil and gas.  The focus on returning substantial free cash flow and share repurchases is likely to be a key positive driver over the next few weeks.
