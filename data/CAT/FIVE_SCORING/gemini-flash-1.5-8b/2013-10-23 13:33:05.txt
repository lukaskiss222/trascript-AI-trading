Caterpillar's earnings call highlights a significant sales decline, primarily driven by the mining sector.  While the company is actively managing costs and improving operational efficiency, the lowered 2013 guidance and flat 2014 revenue outlook indicate sustained pressure on the stock price in the short term.  Management's focus on cost-cutting and long-term market share gains, coupled with a strong balance sheet, suggests resilience, but the outlook for the mining sector remains uncertain.
