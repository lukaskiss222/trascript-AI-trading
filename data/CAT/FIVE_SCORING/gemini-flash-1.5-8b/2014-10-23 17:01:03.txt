Caterpillar's earnings call indicates a strong Q3 performance, driven by higher profits despite relatively flat sales.  Management emphasized consistent profitability and operational improvements, particularly in cost management.  The preliminary outlook for 2015 is flat to slightly up, with caution expressed about global economic growth and uncertainties in several key regions. This suggests a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact on the stock, with investors likely focusing on the firm's demonstrated ability to improve earnings despite challenges.
