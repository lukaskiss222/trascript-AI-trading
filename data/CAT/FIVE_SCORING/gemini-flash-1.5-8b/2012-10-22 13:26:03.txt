Caterpillar's earnings call highlights a significant reduction in their 2012 sales and profit forecasts, driven by lower-than-expected end-user demand and excess dealer inventory.  Management anticipates continued slow growth in 2013, with production levels below end-user demand in the near term.  While the outlook is cautious, the call suggests a focus on inventory management and a moderate long-term view on the mining sector, despite near-term headwinds.
