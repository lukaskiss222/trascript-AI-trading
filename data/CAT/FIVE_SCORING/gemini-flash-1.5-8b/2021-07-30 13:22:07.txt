Caterpillar's Q2 2021 earnings were substantially better than expectations, driven by strong end-user demand and inventory adjustments.  Management highlighted broad-based positive growth across all segments and regions, with a particular focus on the strength of the Construction and Resource Industries.  The call indicates a continuation of strong performance into Q3 and possible stock price appreciation from the positive outlook, despite the ongoing supply chain issues.
