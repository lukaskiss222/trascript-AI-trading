Caterpillar's earnings call highlights significant near-term headwinds due to the global economic downturn.  While management emphasizes cost-cutting and inventory reduction, the substantial decline in sales volume, especially in machinery, and increased financial liabilities point towards a negative impact on the stock price in the next 1-2 weeks.  Management's outlook for 2009 is notably lower than previously projected, which further reinforces negative investor sentiment.
