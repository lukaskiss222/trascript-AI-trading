Caterpillar's 3Q 2019 earnings call revealed a cautious outlook.  Lower-than-expected demand and reduced dealer inventory led to a significant downward revision in 2019 guidance.

This suggests a likely negative impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks, as investors digest the revised guidance and potential macroeconomic implications.
