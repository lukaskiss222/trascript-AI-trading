Caterpillar's earnings call highlighted significant concerns about the short-term impact of declining oil prices on the company's energy and transportation segment, which are expected to drive a substantial slowdown in sales and revenue in 2015.  Management anticipates negative impacts from lower commodity prices and a stronger dollar, with a predicted 9% drop in sales from last year.  While the company aims to maintain operating margins and has a plan for capital expenditure and restructuring, the substantial downward adjustment suggests significant short-term pressure on the stock price.
