Caterpillar's Q1 2017 earnings call indicates strong short-term performance, exceeding expectations with a 4% increase in sales and a doubling of profit per share (excluding restructuring) compared to Q1 2016. Management raised their full-year sales and revenue guidance.  The optimism stems from higher order rates, a substantial backlog increase, and positive signs across several market segments, particularly in China's construction sector. However, significant restructuring costs lowered Q1 profit per share, and management emphasized continued uncertainty, particularly from potential volatility in commodity prices and elevated geopolitical risks.
