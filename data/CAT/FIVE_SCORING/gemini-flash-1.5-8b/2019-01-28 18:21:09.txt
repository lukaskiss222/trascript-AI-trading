Caterpillar's earnings call highlights continued strong performance in 2018, with record profit per share and significant capital returns.  While 4Q 2018 margins were slightly lower than expected due to higher-than-anticipated material and freight costs, the full year results remain strong and in line with investor day targets.  Management expressed confidence in modest sales growth and continued profitable expansion in 2019, emphasizing investments in services and expanded offerings.
