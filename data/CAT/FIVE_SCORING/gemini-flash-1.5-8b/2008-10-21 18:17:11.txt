Caterpillar's earnings call, while reaffirming 2008 guidance, underscored a cautiously optimistic outlook for 2009.  The company pointed to continued strength in developing markets, robust mining and energy segments, and the potential for stimulus packages in developed economies to drive future demand.  However, the call emphasized global economic uncertainty and potential for lower volumes in developed economies, potentially leading to a flat sales year in 2009.
