Caterpillar's Q2 2015 earnings reveal a continuation of global economic weakness impacting sales across all segments, particularly in mining, oil and gas, and construction, especially in China and Brazil.  While management highlights operational efficiency and cost-cutting measures, the company's guidance reflects continued headwinds from depressed commodity markets and a weaker global economy, although the company does highlight some market share gains.  The predicted short-term impact is likely to be negative pressure on the stock for the next few weeks, as investors digest these tempered expectations for the latter half of the year.
