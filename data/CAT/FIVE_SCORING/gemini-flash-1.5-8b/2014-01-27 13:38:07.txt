Caterpillar's earnings call highlighted a strong balance sheet and a commitment to share buybacks, signaling positive investor sentiment.  However, the call also emphasized the cyclical nature of the mining industry, with continued cautiousness regarding future orders and a projected 10% decline in resource industry sales in 2014.  The company's focus on cost reduction and diversification into other segments suggests a strategy to weather the downturn while maintaining a strong operational base.
