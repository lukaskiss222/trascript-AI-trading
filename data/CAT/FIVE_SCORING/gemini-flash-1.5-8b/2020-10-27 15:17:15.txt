Caterpillar's Q3 2020 earnings call highlighted a sequential improvement in performance, albeit still facing significant year-over-year declines.  While sales were lower than expected in Q3, management expressed cautious optimism for Q4 and 2021, citing stronger construction demand, particularly in residential markets and China, plus improving mining activity.  The call emphasized dealer inventory reductions, and the acquisition of Weir Oil & Gas, suggesting a shift towards a more positive outlook for the future despite short-term challenges.
