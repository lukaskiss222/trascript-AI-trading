Caterpillar's 2Q 2016 earnings call shows a decline in sales volume and revenue, primarily due to weakness in energy and transportation, resource, and construction segments.  However, strong cost-cutting measures (over $1B YTD) and a relatively flat demand outlook in the second half, coupled with improved delivery performance, suggest a potential stabilization and even modest improvement in the second half of the year. Management is cautiously optimistic, but the outlook highlights continued market challenges and uncertainties.
