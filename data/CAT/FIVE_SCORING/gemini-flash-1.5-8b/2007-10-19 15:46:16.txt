Caterpillar's earnings call indicates strong performance despite the weak US economy.  Record sales and profit per share highlight the company's global strength in markets like mining and oil & gas. However, management lowered profit guidance for 2007 due to unexpected higher-than-expected core operating costs and currency headwinds.  While the company is optimistic about long-term growth, the short-term outlook is clouded by these issues.  This likely leads to neutral-to-slightly negative sentiment in the near term (1-2 weeks).
