Caterpillar's Q1 2020 earnings call reflects a significant impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.  While the company maintained a strong financial position, sales and operating profit significantly decreased due to lower customer demand and supply chain disruptions.  Management anticipates the pandemic's impact to continue into the second quarter, and withdrew its 2020 financial outlook.  The company has implemented cost-saving measures and is prioritizing liquidity, but the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's duration and economic fallout makes predicting short-term stock price impact difficult.
