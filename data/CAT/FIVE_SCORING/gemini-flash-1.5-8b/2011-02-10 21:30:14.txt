Caterpillar's earnings call highlighted strong 2010 recovery, with sales significantly exceeding 2009 levels and a substantial profit increase.  Management expressed confidence in continued growth in 2011, particularly in emerging markets, and anticipates further increases in machinery sales.  The call also underscored the potential for future profit growth and market share leadership, though the outlook acknowledges remaining uncertainty in the North American construction sector.  This suggests a positive short-term outlook for the stock price, although challenges remain.
