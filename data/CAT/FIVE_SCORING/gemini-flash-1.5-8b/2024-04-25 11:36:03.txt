Caterpillar's Q1 2024 earnings call points to a short-term headwind from soft European construction sales, leading to slightly lower-than-expected sales volume in Construction Industries in the first quarter.  However, strong performance in Energy & Transportation, particularly power generation, and favorable pricing offset this pressure. While dealer inventories are higher than anticipated, management emphasizes the inventory level is within a typical range and that order bookings are strong in E&T.  This suggests potential for a recovery in the coming weeks, based on the continued strength in positive order flow in the Energy and Transportation sectors and ongoing share buybacks.
