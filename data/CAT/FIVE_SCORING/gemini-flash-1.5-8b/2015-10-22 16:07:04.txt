Caterpillar's Q3 2015 earnings call indicates a continuation of challenging market conditions, prompting significant restructuring and cost-cutting measures.  Lower sales, particularly in oil and gas and construction segments due to weak global economies and currency headwinds, drove a substantial profit decline compared to expectations.  While management expressed optimism about long-term opportunities, the near-term outlook is pessimistic.  The stock is likely to experience negative impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks due to the disappointment of the earnings and the continued global uncertainty.
