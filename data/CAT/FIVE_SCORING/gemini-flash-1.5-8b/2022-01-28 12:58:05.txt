Caterpillar's earnings call highlights strong customer demand and record-high backlog, but also acknowledges continued supply chain constraints impacting production and profitability.  While management anticipates pricing will offset rising costs, they acknowledge a likely margin pressure in Q1 2022 due to elevated freight and manufacturing inefficiencies.  The call suggests a short-term headwind but also potential for increased revenues as supply chain issues ease.
