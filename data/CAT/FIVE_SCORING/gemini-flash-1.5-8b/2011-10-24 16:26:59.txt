Caterpillar's earnings call highlights strong Q3 2011 results, surpassing expectations with record sales and profit, driven by both organic growth and the Bucyrus acquisition.  Management expressed confidence in a continued slow economic recovery and a positive outlook for 2012, projecting a 10-20% sales increase. The focus on consistent backlog growth and the ongoing aftermarket business supports the positive outlook.
