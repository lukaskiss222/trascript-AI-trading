Caterpillar's Q1 2014 earnings show strong results in Construction Industries, boosted by inventory build-up and increased demand.  The company's Energy & Transportation segment also performed well, with stable profitability.  However, the mining segment (Resource Industries) experienced a significant sales decline due to weak demand, which affected the overall sales figures.  Management reduced the 2014 Resource outlook, but also noted the potential for limited downward revision given the already low sales projections.
