Caterpillar's Q1 2011 earnings were significantly better than the prior year, driven by a substantial increase in sales volume (up 57%) and a record profit.  Management highlighted improved dealer inventory levels, particularly in construction equipment, and pointed to growing demand in emerging markets as key drivers.  However, lingering concerns about the Japanese earthquake's impact on supply chains and potential inflationary pressures from material cost increases were acknowledged.  This suggests a short-term positive outlook, but possible headwinds later in the year, and possibly into the following quarters.
