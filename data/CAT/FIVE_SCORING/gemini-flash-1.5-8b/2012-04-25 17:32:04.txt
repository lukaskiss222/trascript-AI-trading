Caterpillar's earnings call highlights record profits and raised guidance, driven by strong performance in North America and robust mining demand globally.  Management emphasized that while China saw a decline in the first quarter, this was largely due to a high prior-year comparison and significant inventory, and projected recovery in the second half of the year.  The call suggests a positive short-term outlook for the stock, buoyed by strong performance despite global economic headwinds.
