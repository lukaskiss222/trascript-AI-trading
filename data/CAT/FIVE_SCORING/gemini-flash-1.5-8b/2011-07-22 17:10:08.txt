Caterpillar's earnings call highlighted a strong Q2 performance, with record sales and a significant profit increase compared to 2010.  The Bucyrus acquisition, though adding upfront costs and swap losses, is expected to be a long-term strategic gain with significant synergy potential. The company raised its 2011 guidance, projecting robust growth, but the impact of Bucyrus is front-loaded with most costs associated with integration and deal-related costs falling in the first half.
