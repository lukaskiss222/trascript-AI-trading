Caterpillar's earnings call highlights a cautious optimism for 2010. While sales are projected to increase by 10-25%, the company anticipates a more modest profit per share growth compared to the exceptional recovery from 2009's losses.  The call emphasizes the importance of positive end-user demand and reduced dealer inventories, especially in the machinery sector, as key factors for the return to growth, which should improve in the second half of the year.
