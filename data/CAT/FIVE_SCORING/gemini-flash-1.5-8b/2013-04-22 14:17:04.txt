Caterpillar's Q1 2013 earnings reveal a challenging environment, with sales down 17% due primarily to dealer inventory adjustments and softer end-user demand, particularly in mining.  Management projects continued inventory reduction in the second quarter, but forecasts a return to production increases.  While the company projects sales in a lower range for 2013, they point to a strong balance sheet and improving cash flow, leading to a $1 billion stock repurchase plan.
