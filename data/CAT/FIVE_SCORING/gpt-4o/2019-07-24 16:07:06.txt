Caterpillar's Q2 2019 earnings call reveals mixed short-term implications for the stock. While the company demonstrated modest sales growth and maintained its full-year profit per share outlook, concerns arose from the inventory build-up, unfavorable mix, and a reduction in profit margin. Additionally, guidance suggests profit per share will likely be at the lower end of the range, accompanied by uncertainties in oil and gas and shaving margins. These factors, coupled with higher dealer inventories, imply potential stock pressure in the short term, despite strong cash flow and continued share buybacks.
