Caterpillar's earnings call highlights significant challenges, with a notable decline in sales driven by reduced demand in the mining sector, contributing to a lowered 2013 profit outlook. The management discussed aggressive cost-reduction measures, but these have not fully offset the negative impact from decreased mining equipment sales. Despite efforts to manage costs effectively and stable performance in Power Systems, the continued uncertainty in mining and broader economic risks weigh heavily on the outlook. This uncertainty and guidance lowering suggest potential short-term negative pressure on the stock price.
