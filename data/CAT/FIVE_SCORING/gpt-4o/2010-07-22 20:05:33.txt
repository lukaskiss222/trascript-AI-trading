Caterpillar's earnings call revealed a strong recovery in sales and profits, with Q2 2010 sales increasing by 31% and profits up by 91% compared to the previous year, driven primarily by improved end-user demand and stabilization of dealer inventory levels. The managementâ€™s positive tone and the raised full-year guidance for both revenue and profit indicate optimism about ongoing business momentum, particularly in developing countries. However, potential capacity constraints in certain areas and a cautious approach to pricing and inventory buildup may temper any rapid stock rally in the short term.
