Caterpillar's Q2 earnings call highlighted a challenging environment with sales and revenues down 13% year-over-year, consistent with expectations. The continued weakness in mining, construction slowdowns in China and Brazil, and lower oil and gas-related sales were significant drags. While the company maintained guidance and demonstrated strong cost controls with small profit impacts, structural weakness in key sectors and a lowered revenue outlook due to currency issues indicate potential for short-term stock pressure. The focus on cost controls, strong cash flow, and share repurchases provide some support.
