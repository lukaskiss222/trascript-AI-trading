Caterpillar's Q3 2012 earnings call highlights a record-setting quarter, but with a notable caveat of reduced full-year 2012 guidance alongside a cautious outlook for 2013. The primary issues include reduced end-user demand, particularly from the mining sector, and increased dealer inventories necessitating production cutbacks. Furthermore, Caterpillar's expectation for 2013 sales and revenue to remain flat indicates near-term headwinds. Management's tone reflects caution amidst slowing global economic conditions, suggesting near-term stock pressure as investors digest the potential for subdued growth and lower-than-expected earnings.
