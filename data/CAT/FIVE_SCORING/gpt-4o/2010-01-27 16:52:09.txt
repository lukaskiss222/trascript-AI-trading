Caterpillar's earnings call indicated mixed short-term signals. While 2009 results were weak due to inventory reductions and economic pressure, the management's outlook for 2010 indicated optimism with expected 10% to 25% growth in sales and focus on cost efficiency. However, some headwinds include weak engine sales, tax increases, and unfavorable product mix. The market may remain cautious due to uncertainties around economic recovery and machinery demand, potentially exerting short-term pressure on the stock.
