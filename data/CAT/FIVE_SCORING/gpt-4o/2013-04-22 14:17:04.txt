Caterpillar's Q1 2013 earnings call conveyed both challenges and strategic maneuvers to counteract them. The company experienced a notable decline in sales and profit, largely attributed to reduced dealer inventory and weak mining demand. However, management demonstrated proactive measures, such as inventory reductions, cost controls, and a $1 billion share repurchase plan, indicating confidence in the company's financial stability and future prospects. Expectations for moderate improvements in construction and power systems, along with strategic share buybacks, suggest potential stabilization, but immediate stock price impact may be tempered by persistent mining sector weaknesses and lowered guidance.
