Caterpillar's Q4 2021 earnings presentation reflected solid global demand, with notable 23% sales growth across regions. However, the company faced supply chain constraints impacting its ability to fully capitalize on demand, leading to production inefficiencies and increased freight costs. Management indicated a cautious approach to 2022 with expected margin pressures in Q1, balanced by strategic investments in growth areas like electrification and autonomy. While backlog remains robust and signals potential revenue increases, near-term expectations are clouded by continuing supply chain challenges, likely resulting in a neutral short-term market reaction.
