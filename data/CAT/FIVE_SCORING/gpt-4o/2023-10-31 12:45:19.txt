Caterpillar Inc. delivered a strong Q3 2023 with 12% sales growth, better-than-expected profit margins, and robust free cash flow. Management raised full-year guidance, indicating confidence in continued demand across several key markets, including North American construction and energy sectors. The discussion of management about backlog and supply chain improvements supports a positive outlook. However, concerns over order moderation and competitive pressures might dampen stock momentum slightly, leading to a balanced view on short-term stock movement overall.
