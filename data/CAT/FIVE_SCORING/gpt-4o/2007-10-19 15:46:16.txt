Caterpillar's earnings call highlighted robust sales growth outside North America, achieving record quarterly sales and revenue, which demonstrated the strength of its global operations despite North American market weaknesses. However, the company faces challenges with rising core operating costs and unexpected currency impacts, leading to a slight downward revision of profit guidance for the year. While the preliminary outlook for 2008 remains optimistic due to strong international demand, the substantial increase in costs and the cautious guidance adjustment may weigh on the stock in the short term.
