Caterpillar's earnings call reveals strong Q1 performance with significant growth in sales and profit per share compared to last year, driven by strong end-user demand and effective cost management. Management expresses optimism about various end markets, notably construction and mining, despite noting potential supply chain disruptions. Continued investments in technology and connected assets, along with no current guidance for 2021, suggest the company is positioning for sustainable growth. Despite these positives, the possibility of future cost pressures keeps the short-term outlook slightly cautious. Overall, the immediate short-term impact is likely neutral to positive.
