Caterpillar Inc.'s earnings call demonstrated ongoing challenges for the company, including declining sales and revenues, due in part to weakness in North American construction and a challenging pricing environment. Although the company is focusing on cost reductions and operational efficiencies, these efforts have not fully offset the impact of lower sales. Additionally, the firm anticipates difficult trading conditions to persist into the first half of 2017. Given these factors, the short-term outlook over the next 1-2 weeks appears negative as investors may react to the lowered guidance and continued market pressures.
