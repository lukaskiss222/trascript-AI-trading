Caterpillar reported strong Q4 results with a 20% increase in sales, driven by demand and supply chain improvements. Despite adjusted operating margins reaching an all-time high of 17%, profit per share faced currency headwinds. The company provided optimistic guidance for 2023, anticipating higher sales and profit margins, bolstered by a $30 billion backlog. The market's positive reaction to strong sales, improved margins, and future growth prospects suggests a potential rally in Caterpillar’s stock over the next 1–2 weeks.
