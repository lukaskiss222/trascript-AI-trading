With that, I\u2019ll turn over the call to Joe.\nJoe Saunders: Thank you, Jack, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. Before I discuss earnings, let me speak to the Discover litigation which as you know, we settled just two days ago. We are obviously very pleased that we were able to put this behind us in a manner quite consistent with our retrospective responsibility plan. An additional component of the Discover settlement is settlement of unasserted claims by MasterCard. And with this settlement, I am delighted to tell you that in all disputes, no direct cost to our public Class A shareholders and there is no dilution to their holdings. With respect to the MasterCard release as previously reported, Visa Inc. had taken a $30 million after-tax reserve in the third quarter since this claim is not covered by the retrospect of responsibility plan. As the obligation was connected to the ultimate settlement amount, we recognized an additional $80 million after-tax reserve this quarter. As a result of the Discover settlement, we will be taking steps this fiscal first quarter to fund our escrow account with an additional $1.1 billion. As per our retrospective responsibility plan, when we fund the escrow, our Class B shareholders will bear this cost via a reduction in their as converted share count. It is our intention to seek an amendment to our charger to permit us to deposit our own funds into the escrow account and buy down Class B ownership directly. This approach reduces the total number of shares outstanding for EPS calculation purposes, effectively operating as a share repurchase program in the amount of $1.1 billion. Now, let\u2019s move on to earnings. In the face of a tough US economic environment and increasingly difficult international economic situation as well, the relative resiliency of Visa\u2019s business model is once again reflected in our earnings results. Our adjusted fourth quarter net income was $448 million. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.58. For all of 2008 adjusted net income was $1.7 billion, while adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.25. Net operating revenues in the fourth quarter were strong at $1.7 billion, an increase of 17% over the fourth quarter of 2007 on a pro forma basis, as we again saw solid growth across all three categories. For the full year 2008, net operating revenues were $6.3 billion, an increase of 21% over 2007 on a pro forma basis. As we have signaled in the past earnings calls, we are now seeing operating revenues running more in line with our long term guidance as the positive effects of earlier pricing adjustments had generally been reflected on a year-over-year comparative basis. We also continued to realize the positive impact of our operating scale on our efforts in reorganizing Visa as a publicly traded company. We maintain good expense control on our fourth fiscal quarter and for all of 2008, and we remain committed to managing our expenses prudently without compromising investments in products and technology necessary to fuel future growth. As a result, we delivered strong operating margins this quarter, in line with our recently increased external guidance of mid to high 40% range and we expect to continue that to be the case in fiscal 2009 and 2010. Though the recent past has been relatively positive, what are we seeing for the future? From a broad prospective, we are seeing a further slowdown in consumer spending activity in the US as well as in cross-border buyers. Here in the US for the calendar quarter ending September 2008, on which our 2009 first fiscal quarter's US service fee revenue will be based, aggregate payment volume growth in US has continued to trend at the 10% level seen in the June quarter. Deconstructing this further, credit volume growth average in the low single digits in the quarter trending lower through September. In sharp contrast to credit, debit volume growth was running at low to mid double digits throughout the quarter, pointing out not only the resiliency of this product but the fact that the secularship to plastic continues. Since the beginning of October, we have experienced additional moderation in volume growth in the US credit payment volume which was in the 1% to 2% range for most of the quarter has turned negative through the first three weeks of October. In contrast, debit payment volume has continued to grow at low double digits. While international payment volume growth rates remained stable through September, cross-border volumes are off the high-teen level seen in the June quarter and were running in the high single digits at the end of September. And it is important to remember that, despite the current economic turbulence, international growth both in credit and debit continues to offer us very attractive longer term opportunities as economies mature and payment systems evolve around the globe. Visa is in a superior position to benefit from this trend over the long term. So working in our favor is our industry leading debit presence here in the US and still positive growth rates in credit and cross-border volumes around the globe through September. This should allow us to meet the high end of our 11% to 15% revenue guidance for our fiscal first quarter of 2009, and based on initial observations in October, the middle of the range for our second fiscal quarter. Given the uncertainty over the longer term direction of the economy however, in the US and around the globe for the full year of 2009 and 2010, we are targeting the lower end of that 11% to 15% revenue range including the possibility of single digit growth in our fiscal third and fourth quarters with low to flat cross-border volume growth. But importantly, we remain committed to meeting our guidance of adjusted operating revenue margin in the mid to high 40% range and the 20% plus adjusted diluted earnings per share growth for 2009 and 2010. Even in a downside scenario that saw only mid to high singe digit revenue growth in 2010, we could sustain these targets. Byron will cover additional guidance metrics and other underlying dynamics momentarily. Finally, let me touch on the current wave of bank consolidation and how I see it affecting Visa over the near and longer return. Well, bank consolidation has accelerated recently. It has been a constant factor in the financial industry for decades. The Visa organization and our strength in both credit and debit has proven to be highly adaptable to the changing marketplace conditions. Past mergers in the industry have not had a negative affect on us. To the contrary, our technology scale and product suites make us an attractive partner to our very largest clients as well as the smaller community banks risk and credit units. So in the current wave of consolidation, we believe that we are in good shape but that does not mean that we are resting on the positive history of these relationships or that we take them for granted. We will remain focused on serving our clients and adding value to those relationships wherever we can. With that, let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the financial results and I will be back to provide updates around some of our newer business initiatives.\nByron Pollitt: Thank you, Joe. Let me begin by highlighting some of the business and revenue drivers from the quarter that are representative of the strength of our business. Payment volume through the end of June, which drives our fourth quarter service fees, grew 15% to $699 billion over the same quarter of 2007 on a pro forma basis with the US growing at 10% and the rest of the world growing at 25%. In the September ending quarter, US payments volume continued in the 10% range. Through the first three weeks of October, US payments volume growth has moved to mid-single digits with credit turning negative and debit in the low double digits. Cross-border volume growth in the June-ending quarter was in the high teens moderating to the mid teens in the September quarter though trending lower through the period to end the month of September in the high single digits. In October, cross-border volume growth continued to trend down in all regions except CEMEA. To put cross-border payment volume in historical context, in the recessionary period of late 2001 and early 2002, monthly payment volume growth fell to low single digits and there were several months that were slightly negative, but the severity differed around the globe and on an annual basis. It remained positive for each of those years and importantly upon an economic recovery, the rebound was swift and meaningful across all regions. Moving on to transaction growth, payment and cash transactions were up 14% to $14.1 billion in the quarter ending June 2008 versus the prior year. While the US grew approximately 10% during the period, the rest of the world grew at 20% led by our CEMEA region at 27% and Asia Pacific and Latin America at 19% and 23% respectively. Process transactions or those that we define as being processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled $9.6 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 11% over the similar period a year ago. Globally, which excludes Europe, card growth for the period ending June was up 12% with over 1.6 billion cards carrying the Visa brand. Credit grew 8% to 798 million cards while debit rose 17% to 847 million cards. Internationally, credit and debit card growth was very strong, each growing 18% year-over-year. While credit in general is a more mature market domestically, you can see that internationally we continue to have a lot of runway. On the debit side, as we have often stated, one of our near-term goals is moving these debit cards from cash at ATMs to the point of sale. Moving on to the income statement. In the fourth quarter, gross revenues of $2 billion were up 20% from the pro forma prior year. Volume and support incentives increased by $83 million to $299 million representing 15% of gross revenue. For the full year, gross revenues of $7.4 billion were up 26% from the 2007 pro forma period. Volume and support incentives increased by $447 million to $1.2 billion representing 16% of gross revenue. For 2009, we are expecting volume and support incentives will run in the 16% to 17% range. If we continue to see lower levels of payment volume growth, we would expect to see some offsetting benefit in this line item. Total net operating revenues were just over $1.7 billion, a 17% increase over the pro forma operating revenues reported for the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year 2008, total net operating revenues were $6.3 billion, a 21% increase over the pro forma operating revenues of $5.2 billion reported for 2007. Moving on to the individual revenue line items, service fee revenue was $788 million, up 8% over the pro forma results of the prior year period, reflective of higher year-over-year payment volumes in all regions. For all of 2008, service fees were $3.1 billion up 19% over 2007 on a pro forma basis. Data processing fee revenue was $548 million, up 18% over the prior year period's pro forma $463 million. For the full year, data processing fees were $2.1 billion, up 25% over 2007. International transaction fees were up 45% to $512 million. While for the full year 2008, they were up 44% to $1.7 billion. Both time periods continued to benefit from strong, multicurrency payment volume across all regions as well as from pricing adjustments we made in April of this year to cross-border transactions involving US issued cards. As mentioned earlier, cross-border transactions are currently moderating across the globe though we remain cautiously optimistic that they will continue to post growth and rebound with the economy. Our adjusted operating margin was approximately 45% this quarter and 46% for the full year consistent with our guidance. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses for the fourth quarter declined $229 million or 20% year-over-year to $943 million, driven primarily by lower cost for marketing and personnel. For all of 2008, on an adjusted basis, operating expenses were $3.4 billion, a decline of 4% compared to the 2007 pro forma period, again driven by lower cost for advertising and personnel. We expect that advertising and marketing expense in 2009 to be relatively flat to 2008 and we are continuing our focus on driving operating efficiencies across the enterprise. Capital expenditures were $93 million in the quarter, over half of which were dedicated to the build out of our new data center. Fiscal 2008 capital expending was approximately $415 million. For fiscal 2009, we expect CapEx to be between $300 million and $350 million lower than the 2008 figure, but still elevated as we complete our new data processing center. Post 2009, we expect CapEx to run at around 3% to 4% of gross revenue on annualized basis. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents, available for sale investment and restricted cash of $7.5 billion, a decline of approximately $900 million over the prior quarter. This variance was the result of our annual $200 million payment for the retailer\u2019s litigation settlement which runs through 2012, as well as a reclassification of approximately $953 million from the cash line to the other current assets line on our balance sheet. This reclassification was the result of our investment in the reserve primary fund, a previously highly rated money market fund becoming illiquid. This resulted in an impairment charge of $29 million in the fourth quarter. We believe we will receive our net investment of $953 million over the coming months as the fund is liquidated. This charge is reflected in the investment income line on our P&L and it\u2019s the primary reason we saw a decline in that line this quarter. Of the current $7.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, available for sale investments, and restricted cash, restricted cash of approximately $1.9 billion represents the balance of the $3 billion litigation escrow established at the IPO less the initial payments to American Express of $1.1 billion. Please also note that of the $7.5 billion in year-end cash, that on October 10, we deployed $2.6 billion to redeem all of the Series II and a portion of the Series III class C shares that were held by this year. Thus, on a pro forma basis, cash and cash equivalents should be reduced by this amount for the current fiscal quarter. Let me remind you that the balance of this C class common stockholders holding continue to be locked up until March 2011, while the class B shares are locked up until the later of March 2011 or upon resolution of all of the covered litigations. Our pro forma share count post this redemption stands at 776 million shares. As we have stated since our IPO road show, given our sizeable free cash flow, we have always anticipated implementing a share repurchase program in keeping with our strong belief in returning excess cash to stockholders. In this context, the action Joe discussed earlier to fund the escrow this quarter directly from our cash balances has the same effect of a stock repurchase since Visa will be buying down Class C shareholdings and reducing the amount of shares outstanding for EPS calculation purposes. The size of the repurchase is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. Before I get into our views on 2009 and 2010, let me bring you up-to-date on how we are viewing our evolving capital structure strategy. Simply stated, the key objectives are to reduce our cost of capital over time, ensure adequate liquidity to cover transaction settlement risk and provide sufficient financing capacity to fund future contractual or other obligations such as a Visa Europe and attractive acquisitions. As part of this strategy, management also intends to identify excess cash on the balance sheet and then further enhance total shareholder return by returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. Under our preferred approach, the reduction in shares associated with the replenishment of the escrow account will be funded from excess cash. Although we have significant debt capacity today, we have no compelling use of proceeds and therefore plan to wait and add that at an appropriate time. As we enter fiscal year 2009, the company believes that the combination of its cash reserves, bank collateral, credit revolver, and debt capacity is more than sufficient to cover Visa\u2019s liquidity needs from any individual bank disruption or foreseeable financial events. As our capital strategy evolves, we will keep you updated. Now, let me comment on what we see over the coming year as far as our operating performance is concerned. As Joe already mentioned, payment volume growth is moderating. As a result, on a full year basis, we are projecting revenues to come in at the lower end of our 11% to 15% guidance range. While we expect to achieve the high end of the range in our first fiscal quarter and the middle of the range in the second fiscal quarter, the third and fourth quarters could be more challenging with the possibility of single-digit growth. We are maintaining our mid to high 40% range for adjusted operating margins in both 2009 and 2010 as we should continue to realize incremental savings from our merger and cost initiatives. We remain on tract to deliver annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of greater than 20%, again for both 2009 and 2010 while annual free cash flow should exceed 2008\u2019s figure of $1.7 billion. Our normalized tax rate for fiscal 2009 is projected to be 40% and we continue to take actions that are geared towards driving the rate down into a 35% to 36% range over the next four years. That concludes my comments, so I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Joe. \nJoe Saunders: Thanks, Byron. Before we begin Q&A, let me give you a quick update on some of our longer term initiatives and their progress. Since our IPO road show, we have repeatedly talked about a series of longer term strategic priorities that we would be investing in to support our growth. Longer term opportunities we\u2019ve identified include money transfer, prepaid, mobile payments, and ecommerce. Many of these innovations already are operational in Visa regions worldwide. A number of Visa\u2019s new structure can be scaled more easily on a global basis. In late September, we hosted a technology and innovation day in New York for members of the media, trade organizations, and analysts. In conjunction with that event, we announced several new innovative advances in electronic payments and services. First, we announced that we are developing the suite of mobile applications for the Google Android platform, which will be available for download on Android-powered handsets and initially available to select Visa cardholders. The services will allow Visa cardholders to receive notifications to their mobile devices about transaction activity on their accounts, obtain offers from a wide array of merchants, and use the built-in location-based technology developed by Google to quickly map nearby merchants where they can redeem Visa offers and locate ATMs that accept Visa. We also announced in September that we are working with Nokia, the world\u2019s largest mobile handset manufacturer, to deliver Visa payments and related services for Nokia\u2019s next generation Near-Field Communications handsets. The Visa applications will first be made available for trial use by interested financial institutions. In conjunction with US Bancorp, we have launched the Mobile Money Transfer Pilot Program to allow participating Visa cardholders to use their mobile phones and PDAs to securely send funds directly to another Visa cardholder. The first phase in the program which is expected to launch in early 2009 will enable domestic money transfers within the U.S. or involve key Visa issuers led by US bank in as many as 6,000 Visa accounts. Lastly, we announced the expansion of Visa ReadyLink, a prepaid reload service to enable the reload of eligible Visa prepaid products, products of ATM across the US. Visa ReadyLink gives consumers a secure and convenient way to purchase and add funds to Visa Reloadable Prepaid Cards, a significant advantage to financially underserved consumers and those without a traditional banking relationship or access to a payment card. Visa estimates that there are more than 80 million financially underserved consumers in United States. In addition to the above initiative updates, we have landed a number of new pieces of business recently and although they may not be adding meaningfully to revenue in the near term, they speak volumes to our position in the debit markets around the world. First, last quarter, we singed a multiyear agreement with the Royal Bank of Scotland Group under which the bank will begin issuing Visa-branded debit cards to all its customers. RBS includes Citizens Financial Group here in the United States. The migration to the Visa brand is expected to take place in the second half of 2009. This is obviously a big win for Visa in a highly competitive marketplace. We appreciate the trust and confidence RBS has placed in Visa and our debit offerings. Second, we are announcing today that Visa and HSBC are expanding our global relationship to include new debit card programs in a dozen countries and territories throughout Asia Pacific and the first debit Visa payWave-enabled contact-less payment programs in the Middle East. Under the terms of the five-year agreement for Asia Pacific, Visa will become an HSBC partner for consumer debit products with HSBC issuing more than 10 million Visa debit cards in countries including Australia, India, Indonesia and Taiwan. In addition, HSBC Middle East Limited will begin issuing Visa-branded debit cards in the regions in early 2009. Some of these new cards will be Visa payWave-enabled, allowing consumers to make contact-less payment transactions quickly and securely at the point of sale. The HSBC Visa debit card will be available to all HSBC customers in eight countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. We are obviously delighted with our new arrangements with RBS Citizens and HSBC and look forward to working with both partners to help build their respective businesses. Importantly, these agreements deliver on our strategy to expand Visa\u2019s global debit leadership as we seek to further the migration from cash and check to Visa payments. With that, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator?\nOperator: Yes, thank you. (Operator instructions) First question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang, JP Morgan. You may ask your question.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan: Thanks, I appreciate all the disclosure. It\u2019s really helpful. Let me ask a question about pricing. Has your thinking on pricing and the ability to push through price increase has changed at all since last quarter, given your commentary on the macro?\nJoe Saunders:  I think that our position on pricing remains consistent with where we\u2019ve been up to now, and I think that we\u2019ve indicated that what we do from a pricing standpoint will be consistent with good business practices and our partnerships around the world.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan: Okay, very good. May I just make a quick follow-up and just on bank consolidation. Joe, I know you gave some comments there but can you just give some additional insight on how and maybe when network brand decisions are made as a result to consolidation and obviously, how Visa\u2019s decision given some of the known consolidation that\u2019s out there?\nJoe Saunders: Well, to say the least, we\u2019re in an extraordinary environment and some of these transfers take on \u2013 they\u2019re different and they will happen at different times. We obviously, as I said, are in constant contact with our partners and will continue to be so, but I think it\u2019s inappropriate to talk about contractual relationships.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Frisch, UBS. You may ask your question.\nAdam Frisch \u2013 UBS: Thanks. Good afternoon and great job on the color as well, for what you\u2019re seeing there. I have two questions on credit. First, can you speak to the quality of the 47% of your transactions in the U.S. that are credit? Any metric or set of data point that enables us to more appropriately assess the composition of your credit card holders?\nJoe Saunders: I\u2019m not sure that credit card \u2013 well, credit cards are not 47% of our \u2013\nAdam Frisch \u2013 UBS: I\u2019m just talking about the transaction or the GDV rather. 47% of your GDV, but anything that speaks to the composition of your cardholders whether it be FICO scores [ph] or how many \u2013 what percent of them are revolvers or what percent of them are maxed out on credit lines, or anything that gives us some \u2013?\nJoe Saunders: We\u2019re seeing a shift, a continued shift in both the debit and the credit to non-discretionary purchases. And indeed, when we\u2019ve gone back and looked at it, it is the more credit-worthy credit cardholders that seem to be driving most of the purchases in the environment today. There\u2019s a very low percentage of those transactions that are being driven by people that are credit-impaired or is in the low end of the cycle bends.\nAdam Frisch \u2013 UBS: And what percentage of your cardholders would be in that minority that are not generating a lot of this bend.\nJoe Saunders: About 5%.\nAdam Frisch \u2013 UBS: Okay, so that\u2019s great. And then just one other follow-up on the New York Times article today, talking basically about their suggestion of the systemic shrinking of the consumer credit card industry; obviously, more movement than normal than we\u2019re seeing with different issuers, but do you see the entire supply side getting materially smaller? Or is it just some shifts going on between issuers in specific geographies?\nJoe Saunders: That\u2019s a good question, and I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m in a position to amplify on that right now. Hold the thought for a quarter and let me observe what\u2019s happened from all this movement in the last several weeks.\nAdam Frisch \u2013 UBS: Okay, great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Charlie Murphy, Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nCharlie Murphy \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Thank you. I was wondering if you could discuss the growth in service fees at 8% this quarter versus the 15% payment volume. Is that an indication of pricing pressure and how you expect that dynamic to play out over the next few quarters?\nByron Pollitt: This is Byron. Thank you for asking, Charlie. As I think many of you can appreciate in October at this time last year, we merged together five distinct autonomous regions, and no sooner did we merge them and complete or IPO then we began to standardize all the regions on a common chart of account; and what we realized, Charlie, when as we began this exercise was that not all of our regions classify the revenue components in quite the same way, in terms of key categories as we report externally. So as a result, in recent months, we have begun taking steps to standardize our revenue classifications globally and therefore, you\u2019re beginning to see some of the effects of this common reporting format being applied; and therefore, you are all just going to bear with us on that because our 2008 growth rates by-fee category are just not going to normalize until some time next year. In this particular case, some of the early adjustments we are making are shifting some of what had been classified as service fees to data processing fees; and hence, the difference in the growth rates. I just want to emphasize two things. This has nothing to do with our ability to price or generate strong growth in any of these categories; and secondly, none of these changes impact our recorded total revenue. It\u2019s getting all our regions aligned to report their key categories in a common standardized global format.\nCharlie Murphy \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Maurer with Calyon. You may ask your question.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon: Good afternoon. I wanted to ask if the global slowdown was affecting the level of banks in emerging markets that are looking to add your products or if it\u2019s having any effect on the secular growth in terms of bringing on new economies? Thanks.\nJoe Saunders: No. No, it isn\u2019t. It certainly isn\u2019t noticeable to us. We continue to make progress in emerging countries. Some of our biggest successes recently have been and continued to be in that category.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julio Quinteros, Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.\nJulio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Great. Real quickly, Byron. Can you just go back to the two largest components of your expense, of your operating expenses, looking at personnel, advertising, marketing and promotion, and just walk us through how much further or what levels do you think you can drive those two as you think about the offsets to a slightly lower revenue trajectory over the next two years?\nByron Pollitt: So let me respond in this way. As you may all recall from the road show, management had identified approximately $300 million of expense opportunity across the enterprise that we were committed to achieving as a part of the combination or merger of the five regions. We believe that of that original commitment, we\u2019re about two-thirds of the way through. However, we are also confident that there are additional opportunities beyond the $300 million originally committed, and that conviction is reflected in our guidance for 2009 and 2010, as it relates to our margins.\nJulio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. And then just, can you just rehash the buyback commentary that you made with regards to the Class B shares please?\nByron Pollitt: So in the preferred approach that Joe described, what we were \u2013\nJulio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I just meant the timing of it, that\u2019s all I really need to hear.\nByron Pollitt: I\u2019m sorry. Later session half of the current quarter.\nJulio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust. You may ask your question.\nAndrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust: Hi. Thanks. Could you, Byron, address a little bit the priorities for ad spend and whether you view that as a particular lever, especially given the slowdown in the U.S. I imagine there\u2019s probably a reallocation of advertising and marketing spending priorities here.\nByron Pollitt: Let\u2019s refresh the guidance, the guidance was marketing spending about flat 2009 versus 2008. In previous commentary, we have indicated that we are reallocating against an increasingly rigorous return on investment model that we are deploying in marketing. And so, using that model that is guiding what we have budgeted for 2009, but we will of course pace our expenditures with regards to the economic environment we find ourselves in and the rate of growth we are generating in revenue.\nAndrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust: Okay.\nJoe Saunders: I\u2019d like to add one thing to that. The vast majority of our advertising in 2009 will be targeted at getting people to use plastic when they do whatever they do more frequently than they do today. So in other words, whether the category grows in absolute terms or not, we are dedicated to providing impetus to get people to use the card more. So I want \u2013 when you go to Starbucks, when you go to movie theater, when you go to a \u2013 when you park your car, when you go to the Laundromat, when you take a taxi in New York, when you pay your utility bills or any one of the number of other bills, I want you to use a Visa debit card, and we will have advertising that is directed at doing that. That\u2019s not just similar to what we did a year ago when we had people running around in a circle and somebody throwed [ph] food in the air when an individual took out cash. That was focused on telling people, it\u2019s okay to use a debit card for a small or medium-sized transaction. It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s the thing to do. It isn\u2019t something that\u2019s odd.\nAndrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust: Okay.\nJoe Saunders: So that's how we are going to direct our advertising.\nAndrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust: Thank you. And just to clarify on the comments you made on the contra revenue. Does your second half \u201909 net revenue guidance contemplate a deceleration or decline in contra revenue in addition to lower volume, or is that something that could be an increment to the net revenue guidance?\nJoe Saunders: It\u2019s inclusive. So when we guided to the revenue levels in the second half, they were net revenue levels reflective of our associated projections of incentives.\nAndrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust: Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator instructions) The next question comes from Pat Burton, Citi. You may ask your question.\nPat Burton \u2013 Citigroup: Hi. Thank you. First, a clarification, Joe, did you say the U.S. payment for credit card was negative in October? It just had turned negative?\nJoe Saunders: Yes, I did.\nPat Burton \u2013 Citigroup: Okay. That was a clarification. The second \u2013 the question actually is on the international transaction fee, the discussion there, I assume you\u2019re just seeing a lot of fall off in airline travel. Would that be a good leading indicator to look at in terms of just number of physical bodies that are traveling internationally, or is there something else driving that number?\nJoe Saunders: I mean, that certainly is a significant component but traditionally there\u2019s always been a lot of cross-border volume between Canada and the United States and that\u2019s people in cars going back and forth, not necessarily in airplanes. There\u2019s always been a lot of cross-border volume between Mexico and the United States, and that maybe coming from Tijuana into San Diego. It isn't all\u2013 it isn't by any straight [ph] imagination all airplane travel, I mean, cross-border activity in Asia is also \u2013 given where the countries are, it\u2019s not necessary airplane travel. But it is a big component and it's an indicator.\nPat Burton \u2013 Citigroup: And is it falling globally, or is it just falling as it relates to people traveling to the United States?\nJoe Saunders: I think it\u2019s following globally. All of our guidance contemplates it. Right now, it\u2019s a troubled global economy and people are not traveling as much. People are not coming to the United States as much as they did with the dollar strengthening. There\u2019s a number of things going on. I think it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to get it sorted out. And we\u2019re just putting out guidance that embraces an economy that\u2019s pretty indefinable at this particular point in time. We don\u2019t want to overshoot anything, so we\u2019re trying to be cautious and conservative in what we suggest.\nPat Burton \u2013 Citigroup: Thank you and nice job on the cost side guys.\nJoe Saunders: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Mammone, Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.\nChris Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank:  Thanks. I guess \u2013 first is a couple of housekeeping questions on cross-border. One, what was the growth in cross-border last year? And then two, what is the breakdown in your cross-border base between debit and credit?\nJoe Saunders: I'll tell you what, on the growth curve last year \u2013 let me put it in this context, cross-border volume growth at the beginning of the fiscal year was running in the high 20s globally. As we moved to the third quarter call, we indicated that it had moved down into the high-teens, and now you have cross-border volume, our most recent snapshot, now moderating into the high single-digits. That gives you a one year continuum. And then, cross-border for us is primarily credit and roughly three quarters credit, 25% debit.\nChris Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess Joe, could you just update us with your thoughts on the possibility for interchange regulation in the U.S. next year, I guess particularly given the likelihood that we\u2019ll have sweeping legislation from Congress probably early \u201909.\nJoe Saunders: We continue to remain optimistic that things are going well in that regard. That doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be some noise about it next year. I can\u2019t speak for Congress and so I can\u2019t tell you when it\u2019s going to come up again, but I would think that it would be relatively benign until about the middle of next year. Now, we have a very unique environment that we\u2019re operating in and I\u2019m not sure when this will come up. I continue to believe that it is solvable within the framework of the litigation, and that there\u2019s no need for legislation. And I think that we\u2019re going to work in that direction.\nByron Pollitt: Chris, let me refine the answer. Now that we have the chance to tabulate it, on cross-border, roughly a little over 60% credit, 25% debit, a little over 10% ATM cash.\nChris Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Perlin [ph] of Wachovia. You may ask your question.\nDan Perlin \u2013 Wachovia: Thanks. Just two parts. One is with credits turning down in U.S. and debit volumes still sounding like they\u2019re running in the mid-teens range, I mean, it sounds like it is falling exactly as it did during the last recession. And I\u2019m wondering if you can highlight a few attributes for your business today that are different from that last recession that gives your conviction to be able to maintain even the double-digit overall growth rate.\nJoe Saunders: I think it\u2019s pretty clear. I mean, the debit card was in the different part of its evolution in the last recession that we didn\u2019t have anywhere the debit coverage and we continue to extend the merchant categories in which debit cards can be used. And we continue to make information as it relates to that available to consumers and they seem to embrace it. And look, within all of these guidance that we are giving you, we are talking about things that are predicated on what we see out there in the economy, but you can rest assured that in addition to that, we are very, very focused on penetrating cash and checks to a greater degree than we have in the past and we will continue to do that. I think that that will be a little bit or somewhat of accounted balance to what is going in the economy and we are optimistic that that trend is likely to increase rather than decrease.\nByron Pollitt: I would just elaborate by saying that because of the debit phenomena that Joe described, if you go back to the last recession period, the nondiscretionary component of U.S. consumer spend on our Visa cards would have been about 30%. And today, because of the debit penetration, it is over 40%. With debit cards themselves generating about 53% nondiscretionary mix of the total spend.\nDan Perlin \u2013 Wachovia: Okay. And then the second part of the question is in the last couple of \u2013 I want go back and look at aggregate data in the last several recessions, one of the things that acted as a secular shift was just net new card issuance and I understand the debit shift. I\u2019m wondering what is going to be, with net new card issuance certainly, if 50% of your business not going up next year in the U.S., what is ultimately going to be that secular shift that supports again that double-digit growth?\nByron Pollitt: First of all, we are taking about the double-digit growth primarily coming from the debit product in this environment and I don\u2019t expect that to change in 2009. But we have also talked about a lot about our international volume and we talked about the fact that is continuing to grow at robust rates and frankly, most of that is credit card business. It is not that we do not have the debit penetration outside the United States that we do inside the United States, that is rather an opportunity that we talk about quite frequently on the IPO road trips, so we try to filling out the tube if you will, taking technology that work for us and business practices that have worked for us in the United States and moving them into other parts of the world. I think that what I just talked about in our relationship with HSBC is an example of moving debit cards into other regions. But, the answer is we are growing outside the United States, particularly in credit volume. We have an opportunity to grow debit volume outside of the United States and we have an opportunity to grow debit volume within the Untied States and I would assume that at some point in time, the credit volume is going to stabilize.\nDan Perlin \u2013 Wachovia: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Greg Smith, Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.\nGreg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch: Yes, hi guys. What foreign currency impacts are you expecting on revenues in '09?\nByron Pollitt: This is Byron. Let me give you a preset. If we look back on the year just completed, 2008, we project that about two percentage points of our revenue growth came from FX movements, a tailwind so to speak. As we look to 2009, recognizing that there has been some significant volatility, and we are not in a position to fully predict how it will play out. But on the revenue growth side, that tailwind will turn into a headwind and we are looking at low single-digit revenue growth impacts in the coming year, 2009, and even smaller impact but still negative on the earnings growth impact since you net the two to get to your ultimate impact on the P&L.\nGreg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then this buyback that you would like to do, the 1.1 billion, how will that be priced? Is it just going to literally be based off the current stock price at some point in time or is there some liquidity discount that might benefit you?\nByron Pollitt: I would say stay tuned for that, but it is a market-based price and then we will evaluate at that time whether and what level of discount would be appropriate.\nGreg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch: Okay, hopefully a big one [ph]. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW. You may ask your question.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: Thank you. I appreciate all the color on the updated targets but I want to make sure I've got it all. Byron, could you just rehash the stress case on payment volume and cross-border volume derived at the low end of that 11% to 15%? And then maybe you could also stress the top line to get to that 20% EPS growth.\nByron Pollitt: With regards to the guidance that we gave, what we said was that we felt very confident delivering our margins and our earnings growth if the cross-border volumes went as low as flat. So to the extent that that constitutes a stress case, that is what we mean by that. Could you repeat the second part of your question?\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: I just want to make sure I understood the lowest payment volume could go and cross-border could go, and then subsequently how low could the top line go to get to the 20%?\nByron Pollitt: That we did not specifically comment on. We have clearly assessed the environment to the best we can ahead and we are very focused. The environment has a lot to do with revenue. We are very focused with regards to delivering our margins and delivering the net income growth and EPS growth that we have committed, and so management stands ready to take a variety of steps in order to protect their commitment of earnings and EPS growth.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: Okay. Because I thought you mentioned like the payment volume in the fiscal second quarter should come in at the midpoint of the range and the second two quarters?\nByron Pollitt: I think your confusing something. What we are referring to was net revenue growth. And what we said in the first fiscal quarter is that we expect net revenue growth to come in at the upper end of our guidance range. What Joe said about the second fiscal quarter is that we expect to come in the midrange of our guidance and that the second half of the year, Qs three and four could potentially find single-digit revenue growth in one or both of those quarters and that collectively that would be consistent with coming in at the lower end of our guidance range on a full-year basis.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: Okay, okay. Great, thank you. And Joe, maybe one question.\nJoe Saunders: I want to add one thing. Because I did say that \u2013 if you\u2019re asking for the stress case, I did say that even in a downside scenario that saw only mid to high single-digit revenue growth in 2010, we could sustain our EPS and our operating margins.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: Okay. That applies to 2009 as well?\nJoseph Saunders: Yes.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: Okay, got it. And then Joe, maybe one thing on integration, I mean where are we with extracting revenue and expense synergies from the consolidation of all the various regions? Thanks.\nJoe Saunders: Where are we? I mean, I think to get to a point where you wake up and think everything is going pretty well, it is about a three-year process and I think we are probably further along than that kind of measurement makes you guess, but we are moving there and I think you can expect to see improvement in our expenses over the course of the year as we suggested.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: Okay. Great, thank you\nByron Pollitt: At this point, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And for the last question, Bruce Harting, Barclays. You may ask your question.\nBruce Harting \u2013 Barclays: Rest of the world credit percentage growth in constant dollars stood reasonably flat quarter-over-quarter while U.S. continued to fall at a fairly rapid rate and you said through October actually credit turned negative. As you look forward into 2009 and early 2010, is it conceivable in terms of your saying that given the quarterly progression where you are saying middle of the range in second quarter, lower end of the range in second half next year that rest of the world credit and debit stays reasonable flat or are they just really lagging the U.S. in terms of the slowdown? And then just how low could U.S. get in terms of credit growth from previous downturns? Thanks.\nByron Pollitt: This is Byron. Let me start by saying the growth rates we gave you for rest of the world payment volume growth were nominal not constant, and we recorded 25% payment volume growth nominal in the fourth quarter. And so, what we have indicated is that those have moderated down and that has been factored into the guidance that we have given. And I think Joe\u2019s answer to the last questions which outlined our stress case as someone described it, is how we are trying to be helpful on this subject. U.S. credit has turned negative but just and that\u2019s happened very few times in our history, even during recession. So we have tried to be helpful without guiding to very specific assumptions with regards to payment volume by line item. We have tried to be helpful by saying where we are positioning our revenue growth in each of our quarters, how we expect to end the year and then how we expect to map that into our earnings growth.\nJack Carsky: Okay, thank you all very much. If anyone has any follow-up questions, please feel free to call Investor Relations.\nOperator:  Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jack Carsky, Head of Investor Relations for Visa Inc.\nJack Carsky:   Welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal third quarter earnings conference call. Speaking today are Joe Saunders, Visa\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Byron Pollitt, our Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast live over the internet. It can be accessed on the investor relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to the website prior to this call. Let me please remind you that this presentation may include forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and as a result of a variety of factors actual results could differ materially from such statements. Additional information in concerning of factors is available in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC which can be accessed through the SEC website and the investor relations section of the Visa website. Historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying our fiscal third quarter earnings press release. This release can also be accessed through the investor relations section of our website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph W. Saunders:   For some time now we have been saying that Visa, while not immune to economic downturns, does have a high degree of resiliency embedded in its business model. The proof of this resiliency can be seen in our latest earnings results. For fiscal third quarter 2008 Visa\u2019s net income on an adjusted basis was $457 million which is a 40% increase over the prior year\u2019s third quarter on a pro forma basis. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings of $0.59 per share. Net operating revenues in the fiscal third quarter were strong at $1.6 billion or an increase of 18% over third quarter of 2007 on a pro forma basis as we again saw strong growth across all key categories. As anticipated we are now seeing operating revenues running more in line with our long term guidance and volume growth rates and we expect this dynamic to continue. Last year\u2019s price adjustments which were in full effect by 2/3/2007 had a much more muted impact in the third quarter\u2019s results this year. Byron will discuss the individual revenue line items in a moment. We\u2019ve also begun to realize the positive impact of our operating scale in our efforts in reorganizing Visa as a publicly traded company. Revenue growth is strong and our expense base is currently growing at a very modest rate. We delivered operating margins ahead of our internal expectations and external guidance over the span of our short public life. Given the opportunities to continue to leverage the scale and effectively manage our expenses, we are increasing our longer term adjusted operating margin guidance to the mid to high 40% range. Byron will get into the additional detail in a moment. From a broader economic perspective the financial markets and the economy, particularly here in the U.S., have clearly seen their share of turmoil since we last reported earnings at the end of April. Our expectation going into our fiscal 2008 year was for tougher economic times in the back half of the year and our revenue guidance contemplated this. During the first three fiscal quarters we have exceeded our guidance and although the tougher climate is now here and will likely continue, we expect the fourth fiscal quarter to be at the upper end of our revenue guidance range. For the calendar quarter ending June 2008 on which our fourth fiscal quarter\u2019s USP service revenue will be based. Payment volume in the U.S. though softening has held up pretty well. So what does this mean for Visa? As we have publicly stated our business model remains resilient though not totally immune to the tough economic environment in the U.S. and to some extent globally. We continue to see secular shift to plastic particularly in our debit products in the U.S. and international volumes, including cross border transactions are still posting solid double digit growth. We continue to see increases in consumer driven non-discretionary spending on cards. Through the end of June U.S. consumer non-discretionary spend as a percentage of total spend is up two percentage points over the end of 2007 and now represents 44% of overall Visa consumer payments volume in the United States. The 2% increase is represented by increased debit and credit usage. So while we are maintaining a cautious posture we are optimistic about the future. On the legislative front we had a busy quarter as well. As we were no longer subject to the IPO restrictions of speaking about our company we were able to make some good headway in Washington on the issue of interchange and Visa\u2019s part in the process. This involved a significant amount of outreach to committees and their members as well as testimony from our management team. While there\u2019s no way of knowing for certain what the final outcome will be we feel better knowing that the issues are now being appropriately debated. We would also note that there has been opposition to the Conyer\u2019s bill on both sides of the aisle as well as from consumer groups, credit union coalitions and the Department of Justice. We will continue to actively participate in legislative and regulatory activities which affect our industry. On the litigation front there are a few developments to report in the Discover action which is a covered case under Visa\u2019s retrospective responsibility plan. We recently entered into a judgment sharing agreement which allocates payment responsibilities between Visa and MasterCard for judgments or settlements in the Discover case, with Visa\u2019s share being larger primarily based on relevant bias. At the same time we entered into a mutual release agreement in which Visa and MasterCard release any claims each may have against the other in connection with prior business practices. This includes MasterCard\u2019s claims regarding Visa\u2019s settlement service fee which is referenced in our SEC filings as not a covered claim under our retrospective responsibility plan. As a result of these agreements we increased our litigation reserve for the quarter by $31 million on an after tax basis. Because the Discover litigation and related claims are non-recurring legacy items we have not included these reserves in our adjusted income figures. With that, let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the financial results and I\u2019ll be back to provide more detail around some of the newer initiatives we have recently started.\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.:   Before discussing the P&L let me highlight some of the business and revenue drivers from the quarter. Payment volume, which is a key driver of revenue, grew 19% to $652 billion over the same quarter of 2007 as we continued to see strong results across all of our regions. Credit growth, which was just under 19% worldwide while growing here in the U.S. at a little over 8%, compared to debit in aggregate which grew closer to 20% made up of a solid 16% growth domestically and a strong 44% internationally. We continue to view the secular migration to debit and the opening up of additional payment categories as very attractive near term opportunities. For the calendar quarter through the end of June we have experienced continued solid payment volume growth in the U.S. of 10%. Though moderating a bit from the 12% we reported for the March quarter, we have seen a fairly consistent monthly rate through the end of June and continuing into July. Cross border volume growth, which is currently growing at a robust mid to high teens rate, has trended lower as well from the mid 20% range we experienced through March. The exception to this has been our CEMEA region which continues to grow in the mid 30s range. From an overall payment volume perspective we believe the combination of U.S. debit and international growth will continue to provide growth momentum to our business in spite of the increasingly challenging economic backdrop. Total transactions, including payment and cash transactions, were up 15% to $13.2 billion in the quarter ending March 2008 versus the prior year. While the U.S. grew approximately 12% during the period we say very strong gains across the globe, highlighted by our CEMEA region at 24% and Asia Pacific and Latin America at 20% and 18% respectively. process transactions were those that we define as being processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled $9.5 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 13% over the similar period a year ago. This transaction growth drove strong gains in data processing fees which rose 20% over the prior year to $539 million. Card growth for the period ending March was up 14% excluding Europe with over 1.6 billion cards now carrying the Visa brand. Credit grew 14% to 814 million cards while debit rose 15% to 850 million cards. On an international basis credit card growth was very strong, growing 19% year-over-year while international debit cards grew 16%. Moving on to the income statement, gross revenues of $1.9 billion were up 23% from the year ago period\u2019s $1.5 billion. Volume and support incentives increased by $99 billion to $274 million representing 15% of gross revenue. For the fourth fiscal quarter we see volume and support incentives running at around 16% of gross revenue. Total net operating revenues were just over $1.6 billion, an 18% over the pro forma operating revenues of $1.4 billion reported for the third quarter of 2007. As we stated on last quarter\u2019s earnings call price adjustments made in non-U.S. regions that were fully implemented in the fiscal third quarter of 2007 are no longer influencing year-over-year comparables to as large a degree as they have in previous quarters, so the impact is still positive. During the quarter we observed certain dynamics across all of our key fee categories that continue to reinforce our belief that our business model can sustain attractive growth despite a weakened U.S. economy. Globally, service fees were $749 million up 13% over the pro forma result of the prior year period reflective of higher year-over-year payment volumes in all regions. Data processing fees posted strong gains rising 20% over the prior year to $539 million. We continue to benefit from the greater transaction volumes domestically while continuing our focus on increasing the number of transactions we process internationally. International transaction fees were up 44% to $449 million and continue to benefit from higher multicurrency payment volume across all regions as well as from pricing adjustments we made in April of this year to cross border transactions involving U.S. issued cards. As mentioned earlier cross border transactions remain strong although we are starting to observe a moderation in the growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin was approximately 45% this quarter, an increase of approximately seven percentage points over the similar period last year. The combination of 18% net revenue growth with 4% expense growth drove this margin expansion and resulted in a 42% increase in operating income. Given our performance through the third fiscal quarter and despite our expectation for modest margin compression in the fourth quarter we now expect to deliver an adjusted mid 40s margin for all of fiscal 2008, ahead of our initial long term guidance of the low 40s. As we look out to 2009 and beyond, the resilience of our business model combined with opportunities for additional operating leverage make us comfortable raising our adjusted operating margin guidance to the mid to high 40% range as part of our outlook through fiscal 2010. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses for the quarter increased $31 million or 3.6% year-over-year to $883 million as modest increases in personnel, network and marketing costs were offset by lower professional and consulting fee expenses. On a sequential quarter basis, adjusted expenses increased by $100 million primarily as a result of stepped up marketing and advertising costs commensurate with the mid May kickoff of our Olympic programs and modestly higher professional fees tied to our new product initiatives. In the fourth quarter we anticipate further increases in marketing and advertising spend tied both to the Olympics and marketing programs ahead of the fourth calendar quarter holiday season. All told, marketing and advertising spend should total about $1 billion in fiscal 2008. We also expect a step up in professional fees tied to supporting the new product and channel initiatives which Joe will speak about in a moment. Capital expenditures were $86 million in the quarter, over half of which are dedicated to the build out of our new data center. Full year capital spending is expected to be in the range of $425 million to $450 million. As we have previously stated we expect capital expenditures to remain at an elevated level through the end of fiscal 2009 as we complete our new data processing center. After this we expect cap ex to run at around 3% to 4% of gross revenue on an annualized basis. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalent, available for sale investment and restricted cash of $8.4 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million over the prior quarter. Of this total there is restricted cash of approximately $2 billion which represents the balance of the $3 billion litigation escrow established at the IPO less the initial payment to American Express of $945 million last quarter and their first quarterly payment of $70 million. In addition we ended to use $2.7 billion cash to redeem all of the Series 2 and a portion of the Series 3 Class C shares this October that are held by Visa Europe. As mentioned previously, given our sizable and growing cash balances we are very focused on not allowing excess cash to build up on our balance sheet and to that end we will be considering a share repurchase program as early as the first fiscal quarter of 2009. Now I would like to comment on what we see over the balance of 2008. As I mentioned a moment ago we entered 2008 with the expectation that a softer U.S. economy would have an effect on our payment volume and revenue growth over the next several quarters and we are now starting to see that impact. We also have a pretty clear view into our U.S. payment volumes for April through June which will be reflected in service fee revenue in our fourth fiscal quarter. Based on this early view we are still running at the higher end of our stated revenue guidance range of 11% to 15%. As noted earlier we are increasing adjusted operating margin guidance from the low 40% range to the mid 40% range for fiscal 2008 and over the longer term, 2009 through 2010 to the mid to high 40% range. We also remain on track to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share growth upgraded in 20% and annual free cash flow exceeding $1 billion. That concludes my comments so I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Joe.\nJoseph W. Saunders:   Before we begin the question and answer period let me touch on some of the longer term initiatives and progress we have seen over the past several months. As many of you know, on our IPO road show we outlined a series of near term and longer term strategic priorities that we would be investing in support our growth. Near term we talked about the opportunity to export many of the successful programs we established here in the U.S., like our affluent credit programs, Visa Signature and Visa Infinite, and our debit card product. Executing on these initiatives continues to represent a significant opportunity to have an influence on our 2009 plan. Longer term opportunities we\u2019ve identified include money transfer, prepaid mobile payments and e-commerce. Many of these innovations are already operational in Visa regions worldwide and under Visa\u2019s new structure can be scaled more easily on a global basis. While these initiatives are relatively small today in relation to our total value we see opportunity to invest in these programs, use our brand and business scale and drive incremental transactions on the Visa network over the longer term. Of note is Visa\u2019s money transfer service where we continue to build momentum. Today we are announcing the extension of Visa\u2019s card based money transfer service to millions of additional card holders with the launch of new services in Indonesia and the expansion of the program in Singapore. Specifically, Bank Mandiri, Indonesia\u2019s largest bank is making Visa money transfer available to approximately 8 million debit card holders. The service will allow Bank Mandiri\u2019s card holders to send money through any of the bank\u2019s 3,000 ATMs to any other Visa card holder in Indonesia. Recipients are able to use the money to make purchases, pay bills or withdraw cash from any Visa or Plus ATM anywhere Visa is accepted in the world. Additionally Singapore Post Limited plans to expand its recently launched money transfer service to automated machines that will be available to card holders 24 hours a day. The service facilitates money transfer from customers in Singapore to Visa card holders in nine countries, including China, Indonesia and the United Kingdom. Today\u2019s announcement builds on our existing stable of 46 Visa money transfer programs that have been rolled out in 13 countries. We believe the scale and reach of Visa\u2019s global network ideally positions us to capitalize on the money transfer opportunity over the long term. Another important area of investment for Visa is prepaid which we believe is critical to unlocking new opportunities worldwide. By offering consumers the option to pay ahead, Visa is able to reach new demographics such as the unbanked or under banked and expand relationships with clients including governments, businesses, health care providers and merchants. One of our best success stories to date is government benefits. In the U.S., 35 states participate in 58 Visa prepaid programs to disburse funds including child support, unemployment insurance, workers\u2019 comp and other assistance instead of checks. Last month the State of Michigan launched a Visa prepaid program to deliver unemployment insurance funds which will provide consumers a safe and convenient option to checks and bring cost savings to the state. Around the globe Visa prepaid products are bringing significant value to consumers who rely heavily on cash and checks. Last week Visa and Absa Bank, a subsidiary of Barclays, introduced the first reloadable prepaid cards in South Africa and in June, Visa and Taiwan Cooperative Bank launched Taiwan\u2019s first general purpose reloadable prepaid card, further extending the reach of Visa prepaid programs to underserved consumers. Mobile payments are a great opportunity but also a great complexity as multiple wireless standards and operating systems exist around the globe. To address these challenges we launched the Visa mobile platform last year, a suite of technologies that enables Visa, its clients and mobile operators to engage in trial activities in more rapidly developed commercially scalable mobile services. While more work must be done, Visa has successfully launched a range of mobile services that are in market or being tested today with cardholders in 14 countries around the world, including the U.S., Australia, Canada, Taiwan and Brazil. With more than 3.5 billion mobile devices in the market around the world and 80% of the world\u2019s population living within range of a cellular network we believe Visa has a significant opportunity to build on our leadership, extend our products and services to new geographies and drive more electronic transactions to Visa net. As we have stated in the past our focus on the e-commerce phase is designed to increase our industry leading 47% payment penetration here in the United States. We are developing enhanced checkout, gateway and online authentication services to improve merchant and cardholder experiences. In fact, we expect to bring to market the next upgrade of online authentication later this year. We are also in the process of further advancing cross border functionality especially between the U.S. and Latin America and the U.S. and Asia. More recently, in India, we launched eMarketplace in association with ICICI Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in that country, enabling end-to-end execution of procurement and payment over the internet using a Visa purchasing card. This is the first Visa eMarketplace service to be launched in Asia Pacific. As always we will continue to update you on these initiatives as they progress. With that, we\u2019re ready to take your questions.\nOperator:   (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Bob Napoli of Piper Jaffray.\nBob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray:   Question, I think it would have been a bigger surprise if you had not raised your operating income margin guidance but I just wondered if you could break it down a little bit on what drove the income guidance, the increase. Is it lower volume and support agreements or general, better efficiency than what you expected? What drove that increase?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.:   The math of it is, as we continue to drive strong double digit gains in revenue above our initial expectations for this year; so we delivered 18% this quarter and on that only a 4% increase in expenses and we were able to sustain higher levels of revenue growth for this year compared to our original expectations. We became much more confident that we could sustain a margin higher than what we had originally anticipated and therefore felt confident in adjusting the margin guidance.\nBob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Just a follow-up, do you think that there is a natural cap on your margin driven by volume support agreement, demands from customers or \u2026? I just wonder if you could comment on that.\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: The way we\u2019ve chosen to respond to margin expectations is with our guidance, and so over the next two years we believe that we can sustain operating margins in the mid to high 40s and that is as far out as we\u2019re looking at margins today.\nOperator:   The next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: In a couple quarters, a couple questions from the quarter. First, Byron, I guess the cross border volume trends. What is the geographic exposure that you have there and what regions are you seeing growth moderate the most?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.:   That would be the, what we would say on the cross border volume is that we\u2019re maintaining very, very strong, robust growth outside the United States even though it has moderated a bit. As we said on the call it is still mid to high teens in terms of growth and that growth is very healthy across the globe outside the United States. The growth rates are still positive in the U.S. but we\u2019re seeing more of the impact in the U.S. than anywhere else in particular and CEMEA of course was a call out of maintaining 30 plus percent growth rates on cross border.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: Is your exposure to the U.S. in cross border similar to your overall exposure to the U.S. in terms of purchase volume?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.:   What we\u2019d say is it\u2019s a well diversified portfolio of cross border\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: I just wanted to confirm that you expect fourth quarter revenues to be at the high end of your 11% to 15% range.\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.:   That\u2019s correct. The annualized guidance is 11% to 15%. When you apply that to the fourth fiscal quarter what we\u2019re suggesting is that our performance is consistent with coming in at the higher end of that range, net revenue for the fourth quarter.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: So if that\u2019s the case I\u2019m just trying to understand what would drive the shift from the 18% growth in the third quarter to roughly 15% in the fourth quarter.\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.:   We have annualized a number of price adjustments that are having, really we\u2019re coming to the end of their full effect and we already are informed by our U.S. volume which is consistent with the, on a month-to-month basis, has been consistently delivering around a 10% payment volume growth from March forward and with the moderating impact that we alluded to in our cross border volume. We would see a somewhat marginal decline in our revenue growth from 18%, which we delivered in this quarter, to the upper end of our guidance range, 11% to 15%.\nOperator:   The next question is from Adam Frisch of UBS.\nAdam Frisch \u2013 UBS:   In my conversations with investors I get the feeling that most people are focused on a slower consumer but forgetting about the secular trends that are a cornerstone to our thesis, so can you address from what you are seeing in your payment trends? Will there be a shift from credit to debit or other factors that could make us feel good that the model is still holding up and there are secular trends still in play here? Also, describe the hedging that your volume support line offers. I\u2019m assuming it works very well in a slowdown but a meltdown might be a different kind of story, if the consumer feel off the cliff. If you could just address those two perspectives?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : Let me start with the hedging. With regards to our FX exposure on revenue, which is one way of looking at this, our revenue lift is roughly 2% and with regards to the overall exposure to the cross boarder volume, I think we have a very well diversified set of strong growth rates cross region so in that regard we feel that if the economy falls in any one particular country or region, we are well diversified. Then, an increasing number of our contracts are multiyear in nature and therefore have incentive clauses that will vary by volume and so if the growth rate in any of these contracts slows down, we have a natural adjustment as it relates to the way the incentive formulas work. So, while not immune to a slowdown in any part of the world or in any particular economy or client, we do have, I think, a well diversified set of factors that will help make our business less vulnerable and more resilient.\nAdam Frisch \u2013 UBS: Pricing impact on the quarter you said was more muted, should we anticipate any change in the near term there that could get the growth rate up a little bit more than we\u2019re expecting?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : I would suggest that you go back to our guidance. We have fully factored in all the factors including pricing adjustments that would impact our net revenue growth and we feel very good about high end of that 11% to 15% range for the fourth fiscal quarter and we feel very good about delivering in that range over the two years 2009 and 2010 at this point.\nAdam Frisch \u2013 UBS: Last question here, I was going to ask about cost but the card based remittance initiative I have to ask because it\u2019s been a long time coming from what we\u2019ve been writing about. How has this been tracking in the market it\u2019s been around in for a while? And, are you gaining new customers or taking share from traditional players?\nJoseph W. Saunders : I\u2019m not sure I understand the question.\nAdam Frisch \u2013 UBS: On the card based remittance programs that you already have out there, how have they been tracking in terms of growth? And, are you gaining new customers or taking share from traditional players? In other words the new customers being people that never spent money before?\nJoseph W. Saunders : In general, we\u2019re gaining new customers. We\u2019re offering a new service to our own customers and its being done on a global basis and it\u2019s being done between many different varying countries, it isn\u2019t a US to Latin America, or US to Asia center program. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s big enough yet to say we\u2019ve stolen share from anyone.\nOperator:   Our next question comes from Dan Perlin \u2013 Wachovia Securities.\nDan Perlin - Wachovia Securities: Just a couple of quick questions, one is if you could maybe decouple \u2013 you know, your international fee growth was up over 40%, I think Byron you mentioned your transactions were in the mid to high teens, maybe even low 20s and obviously FX had an impact there. Can you just talk about reconciling the transaction growth that drove that along with FX so we can kind of figure out what the pricing component of that was?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : Dan, the primary component of the difference between the two, remember this is an area where we have probably done the most in terms of price adjustments over the past year or so and what you\u2019re seeing is the impact of those. Initially with cards issued outside the United States and as recently as April we took some steps that would increase the revenue impact based on cards issued in the United States and that\u2019s the primary explanation for the difference between what we recorded in aggregate and the percentage increase in transactions.\nDan Perlin - Wachovia Securities: Is there another one that we should be thinking about as we go in to 2009?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : On the international side we have not announced anything and with regards to pricing in general, all of that \u2013 let me just assure you, we take appropriate steps that make good business sense for our customers, our clients and all of that is reflected in the guidance we have given you for the fourth quarter and for the next two years.\nDan Perlin - Wachovia Securities: Then on the other revenue line, that was up quite a bit as well. Were there some pricing adjustments that you took advantage of there?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : No.\nDan Perlin - Wachovia Securities: Can you just remind us, consumer inflation, the impact that you have on your non-discretionary spending line, is that playing a meaningful role in the quarters or not so much?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : We haven\u2019t looked at that and evaluated it. Our sense would be short of certain commodities that have increased significantly in price that that is generally not so much a factor.\nDan Perlin - Wachovia Securities: Then a question on the marketing and advertising spending, you gave us a number of $1 billion for the full year so that implies somewhere around $300 million. What was in last year\u2019s number because that number would be down pretty significantly year-over-year? Were there some onetime items? I just forget, on a year-over-year basis it will be year-over-year down pretty significantly?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : A damn good question. I know that it will be of interest to many to figure out how to seasonally model our marketing and it\u2019s simply too early or it\u2019s just premature to try and do that at this point. You have the math right in terms of the $300 million or so given that we have three quarters of actual but, as we had indicated I think, on a prior call, we still have a relatively new in place chief marketing officer who is rationalizing our marketing spend globally, reprioritizing it based on return on investment and as a result, past is not something you should count on as prolog and as we develop a more normalized cadence in our marketing then we\u2019ll be able to highlight for you and you\u2019ll be able to model it better.\nOperator:   Our next question is from Elizabeth Grausam \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.\nElizabeth Grausam \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: I just wanted to ask another question around your US volume. In the comments you made earlier, you had about 12% total payments volume in March quarter in the US and I think you said that went to 10% from the month of March to the month of June. Is that the correct progression to think about? And also, was that dominantly driven by further deceleration in credit from March to June or did you also see your debit portfolio decelerate in growth?\nJoseph W. Saunders : What we said was that the growth in the US volume was about 10% from March through this month. And, so the 12% to 10% was on a quarter-by-quarter basis and what that would suggest was that the growth was more robust in January/February. But, since March it has been very consistent. So, the answer is we don\u2019t see a lot of movement in the volume, or we haven\u2019t seen much movement in the volume in the US since February. And, February\u2019s growth rate was influenced to some extent by the fact that there were 29 days in February.\nElizabeth Grausam \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:   And the deceleration you saw in January and February through to March to June was that predominately in credit or both credit and debt, was it blended?\nJoseph W. Saunders : Predominately it would be more pronounced in credit.\nElizabeth Grausam \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Another question on your service fees, a similar question as Dan asked around your international fees, the service fee growth in the quarter was about 13% revenue growth but it was on 19% volume. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen revenue growth actually below the volume growth but yet the incentives line was also lighter. Can you help us understand the balance between thinking about pricing and the gross service fees and how that mechanism works with your incentive fees?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : More to come on this later Liz, I think from our perspective it\u2019s just a bit premature to look for quarter-to-quarter patters until we can normalize our operations now that we\u2019re in for profit mode. We have everything from seasonality, price adjustments, FX movements and until we can get in to a more normalized cadence, it\u2019s hard for us to provide a thoughtful explanation as to particularly the sequential growth. Year-over-year is easier but the sequential is harder until we can accelerate through the normalization of a for profit company. More to come on this one.\nJoseph W. Saunders : But, on a sequential basis, the previous quarter included December.\nOperator:\n : Our next question comes from Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.: I was hoping you could comment on the spending from your signature customers as we saw a big fall off in American Express\u2019 numbers and their card holders are generally viewed to be at the upper tier. So, I was wondering if you could comment on if there was any unusual drop off in your signature cards versus your standard Visa cards.\nJoseph W. Saunders : Actually, our signature volume has held up very, very well and as a matter of fact, it\u2019s significantly up on a year-over-year basis. It\u2019s our traditional card volume that is down and I talked about that last quarter. You\u2019re asking me a question about signature cards versus AMEX in general and while they have a huge component of that and I can\u2019t speak for them, they\u2019ve also gotten in to lending a lot of money.\nOperator:   Our next question come from Patrick Burton \u2013 Citigroup.\nPatrick Burton \u2013 Citigroup: I guess I\u2019ll ask about the tax rate. Byron, it looks like you\u2019re looking for a little higher tax rate this year and then progressing lower from the 41 level?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : That\u2019s correct. So, just to repeat expectations, as we completed our restructuring in October and for the first time assembled our five businesses, we had no corporate tax planning and as a result we find ourselves unenviable at a 41% rate and we are engaging in what we would describe as classic global tax planning and over the next five years expect to get down in to the 36% range and would expect in the year to come, fiscal year 2009, to generate at least one to two percentage points reduction in that tax rate.\nPatrick Burton \u2013 Citigroup: And would you expect 41% in the fourth quarter?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : Note that when we do our adjusted earnings, we apply a 41% tax rate. From a book standpoint, we actually have some adjustments that we have described in our financial statements that are largely due to purchase accounting and therefore do not have a cash impact on our tax rate. So, to assume something in the vicinity of 41% as a cash tax rate for the fourth quarter would be fair.\nOperator:   Our next question comes from [David Haxton \u2013 Buckingham Research].\n[David Haxton \u2013 Buckingham Research]: Could you maybe provide a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing so far in terms of marketing spending and where there are some opportunities to shift dollars? And, also provide us color on US credit card spending? You mentioned that signature volume was up a lot but are there any other kind of noteworthy trends geographically or by other products?\nJoseph W. Saunders : Well, I think that what we\u2019ve said is that credit card spending in general is much softer, it\u2019s not down but it\u2019s marginally up in the low single digits. So, our debit card spending on the other hand has continued to grow and is very robust. Signature cards are not a predominate part of our overall volume.\n[David Haxton \u2013 Buckingham Research]: Could you give us an update in terms of what percentage of volume is on signature now?\nJoseph W. Saunders : We don\u2019t break that out right now.\n[David Haxton \u2013 Buckingham Research]: And in terms of marketing, I guess looking at expenses overall as you\u2019ve become a for profit company and you\u2019ve started your review of expenditures around the world, what kinds of things are you seeing that are opportunities?\nJoseph W. Saunders : Well, first of all we have an opportunity to consolidate the way we spend money by consolidating agencies and running the marketing environment out of a single place. We obviously have marketing people in all of our regions that support our marketing efforts but it is more singularly and more effectively driven and it certainly will be in 2009 and its improved over the year 2008. As it relates to where we spend money or how we spend money, we spend money predicated on a pretty rigid ROI model and we are looking at opportunities in different regions in the world where we think we can make a difference.\n[David Haxton \u2013 Buckingham Research]: Then can you just tell us, I think there was an uptick in investment income this quarter, was there anything there?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : We\u2019re carrying higher cash balances and that\u2019s the principal reason. We\u2019re getting a little more yield but, it\u2019s principally higher cash balances.\nOperator:   Our next question is from Christopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Just to beat down on the pricing a little bit more, the international fee increase on cross boarder that you implemented in April, that was the only significant price increase in the second quarter?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : That is the principle price increase for the second quarter.\nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: And that\u2019s actually effective in the fiscal third quarter revenues you just reported?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : Yes. Think of that as beginning in the fiscal third quarter.\nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: So, I guess I\u2019m trying to understand is a couple of things, we talked about the pressure I guess on services fees, if you look at volume on service fees relative to revenues the margins there got squeezed a little bit and your guidance for fourth quarter revenues at the high end of you guidance what kind of volume are you assuming for the fourth quarter. Does the margin continue to compress a little bit? Or, is there anything else that we\u2019re not really discussing yet in terms of pricing that would cause the service fees to bounce back a little bit in the September quarter?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : Obviously there are a lot of factors that go in to a projection. The way that we\u2019ve tried to be helpful with this is to give you a combination of revenue guidance, 11% to 15% upper end of that range for the fourth quarter and to do that \u2013 which reflects all the initiatives we have underway including anything that we may have done on the pricing front and then to combine that with a margin expectation which, as you noticed, we have moved our margin guidance up for the full year to mid 40s although we do expect some margin compression in the fourth quarter. But, that is less about revenue and much more about an increase in marketing spend which we called out as well as professional fees associated with new product initiatives so that\u2019s much more expensive driven, that margin compression. Then, with regards to the impact that any other action we might take within the pricing front, all of that is reflected in the revenue guidance we\u2019ve given for 2009 and 2010 which again, we have given all of you with an expectation of operating margins associated with that which gives you the type of operating leverage we expect to deliver and of course, on this call we have raised that to mid to high 40s with an 11% to 15% annual revenue guidance. So, that\u2019s how we\u2019ve tried to be helpful on this point.\nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Let me ask you just one more way. I didn\u2019t quite understand that your answer to Liz\u2019s question on the service fees as well. What are the quarter-to-quarter variances? How does FX impact that line? One thing that I was thinking about was your seeing a little slower growth in credit and debit may be a little bit lower margin on a revenue basis so that\u2019s impacting a little bit. Anything else you could sort of call out quarter-to-quarter that would impact? I wasn\u2019t quite sure what you were referring to in your earlier answer on the service fees.\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : Again, I would say nothing to call out at this time. They\u2019re just a number of factors that vary from quarter-to-quarter and as I mentioned before, it\u2019s seasonality, incentives, FX is definitely a part, the timing and impact of price adjustments, all these things in order to be helpful ultimately with an answer that can inform models so that you can get better projections, we\u2019ve got to sort that out and we\u2019re doing it in our first year as a public company and we\u2019re simply not at a normalized rate where we\u2019re prepared to give a thoughtful point of view on that kind of breakdown. So, if you\u2019ll just bare with us a bit longer we\u2019d be happy to be more informative as we get in to our more normalized operating mode.\nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: One final just clarification, the deceleration in cross boarder activity, you said that was more pronounced in the US. How much more pronounced in the US and is it relatively stable outside the US or is it also slowing outside the US?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : We didn\u2019t guide to that, what we said was that back in March it was in the mid to high 20s. What we\u2019re now seeing today is mid to high teens so it has moderated but it is still very robust at mid to high teens and as you would expect, the US given its economic backdrop would be feeling that a bit more than the other regions outside the US.\nOperator:   Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Most of my questions have been asked already but just a quick question maybe on the supply side. Have you guys seen any noticeable trends from your financial institution partners in pulling back lines or decelerating account growth?\nJoseph W. Saunders : Well, I think it\u2019s clear that there is some of that going on, it\u2019s a fairly difficult environment. But, remember our income is driven by activity and that means that we are primarily influenced by cardholders that are not at the pushing the top of their credit limit, they\u2019re not delinquent. These are not the types of bank customers that drive much volume through our system. So, it\u2019s harder for me to discern those trends and the data that we would have on it would be at least a quarter old.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Just clarification on the litigation commentary, that $31 million, that\u2019s all for the Discover litigation?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : No, what we said was that as a result of a review of our litigation portfolio and agreements that we have entered in to that it was appropriate for us to take a FAS 5 litigation reserve against legacy cases that we do not expect to repeat going forward. So, as you can appreciate, it is not our practice to discuss ongoing litigation but the reserve is a FAS 5 reserve associated with a case that would not be covered by our retrospective responsibility plan.\nJoseph W. Saunders : But, is related to the Discover litigation.\nOperator:   Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.\nAndrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Byron, just maybe on a more qualitative basis, I look at the volume and support incentives, can you just comment on how you are issuing customers who are performing versus the contractual obligations that were set up when you entered in to each of those just sort of directionally better, worse, kind of in line?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : Most of the incentives that we commit to contractually today are in the United States so as a backdrop, if the economy is more challenging and if payment volume growth rates are less than what they have been over the past several years when the US economy was stronger, then it would be natural for the incentive earn outs to be less than what they would have been a year or two ago. These things are difficult to model absent knowing exactly what growth rate each individual client is delivering. But, I would say on average as a US portfolio, it is paying out less primarily driven by the economic environment that all our clients find themselves in today in the US.\nAndrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Any view toward ongoing or maybe accelerated deceleration if you will, a slowdown in volume growth would have probably a commensurate positive affect if you will on the contra revenue line?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr. : What we tried to give you to be helpful is first very near term, what we\u2019ve indicated that for the fourth quarter of this year, we think the incentives, we think of it as incentives as a percent of gross revenue. We\u2019re suggesting or guiding that we think it will be around 16% incentives to gross revenue in the fourth quarter which is in a much more normalized range of incentives to gross revenues. So, something in that range of 16% to 17% is something we think would be fair to think about in the near term.\nAndrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Then, just a question on the competitive environment, anything changing first of all on pricing? And secondly, obviously MasterCard has announced a fairly aggressive push in to debit, one of the features of which is the option to use any MasterCard, signature card as a pin debit card. Any view on how that might sway issuers decisions as to who\u2019s brand they\u2019d rather have predominate on their cards?\nJoseph W. Saunders : We\u2019re mindful of what MasterCard has done and we\u2019re respectful of them and what they have done but there\u2019s no way in the world I would guide you to the fact that we\u2019re going to lose any significant debit volume in the near future or in the future that I can see.\nOperator:   Our next question is from Bruce Harting \u2013 Lehman Brothers.\nBruce Harting \u2013 Lehman Brothers: It looks like this is your strongest debit volume growth quarter in the last seven or eight. How high can that go and how low do you think the credit growth can go specific to the US? And Joe, you mentioned you have the ability to visit Washington, if you could, could you frame the debate as you see it and what the Visa platform is?\nJoseph W. Saunders : I think we\u2019re looking at reasonably steady state growth parameters in the credit and the debit right now. I don\u2019t see it changing a lot in the near future. But, I don\u2019t know. I mean, it\u2019s not predictable. As it relates to Washington, I think what we said earlier was that we have an ability to go there and we have an ability to talk to them and we have an ability to lay out the facts and we\u2019re considerably more positive about the end result than we might have been even a couple of months ago and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Of course, I\u2019m talking about Interchange, I\u2019m not talking about Fair Credit Billing Practices. That is not an issue that we are directly involved in. It is not an issue that we would talk to anybody in Washington about, that is an issue between financial institutions and the Fed and Congress.\nBruce Harting \u2013 Lehman Brothers: Is there anything between now and the election that would come forth out of Washington on Interchange?\nJoseph W. Saunders : I don\u2019t believe so.\nJack Carsky :   Thank you all very much for joining us today. If anybody has follow up questions, please feel free to call investor relations."}], "2010": [{"symbol": "V", "quarter": 4, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-10-27 21:48:07", "content": "Executives: Jack Carsky - Investor Relations Joseph W.

I am pleased to report that our fiscal fourth quarter results were once again consistent with the guidance and expectations we provided during our last earnings call. Several metrics even exceeded our expectations.  While the U.S. and the rest of the world were still picking themselves up from the economic storm of the past year, we are beginning to see some very early signs of stabilization and some positive trends in aggregate [inaudible] . Earnings for the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis were $0.74 per diluted share. For all of 2009, adjusted earnings were $3.23 and were positively impacted by the sale of our nearly 10% equity ownership in Visa Net de Brazil last quarter. On an adjusted pro forma basis that excludes this gain, Visa earned $2.92 per diluted share, a 30% increase over 2008 and well above our stated earnings goal.  Net operating revenues in the fourth quarter were almost $1.9 billion, a 10% increase over the year-ago period and above our guidance of mid-single digit growth due to the better than expected processed transaction growth, cross-border volumes, and our previously announced pricing modification on domestic processed transactions. Net operating revenues for fiscal 2009 were $6.9 billion, a 10% increase over 2008 and moderately higher than we had re-forecast earlier this year.  Our adjusted operating margin was 49% for the fourth quarter, modestly diluted due to the reorganization charges and marketing investments related to creative development for the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup, and our recently announced Courtesy of Progress campaign. For full year 2009 our adjusted operating margin was 53%, consistent with our guidance of low 50s. For fiscal 2010 we are increasing our margin guidance to the mid-50% range. Byron will speak to this further momentarily. Adjusted fourth quarter income was $552.0 million, a 23% increase over the year-ago period. For the full fiscal year 2009, adjusted net income was $2.4 billion, excluding Visa Net de Brazil, pro forma adjusted net income was $2.2 billion, representing a 26% increase over the adjusted 2008 period. I will let Byron get into the specifics on payment volume trends but in general we are beginning to see some very early signs of improvement, domestically and internationally. While we cannot predict the ultimate speed or size of the economic recovery, or if the flu pandemic will have any meaningful effect on cross-border volumes, we are feeling more positive about trends for the first time in a long while. Another clear sign of progress is in processed transactions. For the September quarter we reported processing $10.5 billion transactions, a 9% increase over the prior-year period as the migration to electronic payments continues on a global basis. Just in the month of September, the growth rate expanded to 10% and that has been the trend through the 18th of October. From a marketing and advertising perspective, we have made immeasurable strides over the past year founded on an hour-wide-based analysis of our marketing spend. We began, and will continue, to move away from brand advertising towards more specific product line initiatives like debit, foreign credit, prepaid, and mobile. We are devoting more of our marketing dollars to the digital space globally and we are focusing more of our spending on key growth markets like Brazil, Russia, and the GSCC. We expect to maintain a similar, or slightly elevated, level of marketing spend in 2010 over that of 2009, given the importance of staying ahead of the curve as key economies across the globe begin to rebound. All in all, our financial performance in fiscal 2009 was solid, especially given the economic environment we are operating in. We delivered on all of our financial goals and even exceeded them in several metrics while investing in all of our growth initiatives and executing very effectively on our efficiency programs. This led to record free cash flow in fiscal 2009 of $3.3 billion, inclusive of the Visa Net de Brazil sale, which allowed us to return over $2.1 billion of excess cash to our shareholders over the course of the year. In this same vein, last week we announced an increase to our annual dividend of 19% and today announced the authorization of a share repurchase program totaling $1.0 billion. We are extremely pleased that Visa is able to continue to build on our success in driving total return to our shareholders and today's buyback announcement and the recent dividend increase are evidence of our continued commitment to our shareholders in 2010. In addition to the mid-50s operating margins mentioned earlier, as we look ahead we are increasingly confident that we can regain the low end of our 11% to 15% annual net growth target and deliver another year of better than 20% adjusted EPS growth. We are also establishing a similar EPS growth target for 2011.  We believe that we have positioned areas of our business to take full advantage of the economic rebound as it materializes. We will provide additional information around our future expectations in early March at what will be our inaugural investor day. From an investment standpoint we have identified those opportunities that will result in the greatest return on investment over the near term and will continue to be a critical part of our longer-term growth, both domestically and globally. These include acceptance, debit and prepaid, global processing, and of course, enhancing our presence on the Internet. I will speak to these further at the end of the call. We have continued to make good progress in Washington and believe that the interchange debate increasingly is viewed as a business-to-business issue that it is, not the consumer issue the merchants' lobby has attempted to portray it as.  We are focusing our resources on educating the proper constituencies to the facts with the debate rather than allow rhetoric and misinformation frame the discussion, and to that end we look forward to the completion of the GAO study later this year. In concert with our Washington efforts, earlier this month we launched a marketing program designed to better define Visa's role as a payments network and articulate the powerful ways that digital currency advances economic empowerment and business efficiencies globally. Titled the Currency of Progress, the initiative uses real-life stories to demonstrate how the migration from cash and checks to electronic payments has helped individuals access their money more securely and conveniently, build stronger more efficient businesses, and enabled governments to be more cost-effective and responsive to their citizens. The reliability and speed of Visa digital currency is often taken for granted and not enough people understand that Visa is a global payments technology company that enables financial institutions and merchants to deliver the value of electronic payments to the world. Finally, earlier today we issued a press release announcing the renewal of our sponsorship of the Olympics games for an additional eight years, through 2020. This contract renewal is a testament to a long history of working relationship with the International Olympic Committee and really speaks to the global nature and reach of Visa's business. We also recently resigned our sponsorship of the NFL through 2014, and along with our sponsorship of the FIFA world cup, these three premier properties keep the Visa brand and promise in front and center to global audiences. With that, let me turn the call over to Bryon, who will take you through the details of our financial results, and then I'll be back to share my views for the coming year.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: Let me begin with the financial highlights for our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2009, then I will touch on payment volume trends we are seeing for the September quarter, as well as some early volume and transaction results for October. As Joe previously mentioned, it was another solid quarter with better than expected revenue growth and earnings growth in line with our guidance. As you may recall, service revenue for the September quarter is based on payment volumes realized during the June quarter. Accordingly, total payment volume growth for Visa Inc. through the end of June, in nominal dollars, was a negative 2% over the same quarter in 2008, an improvement over the negative 5% recorded in the March quarter. On a constant dollar basis payment volume grew a positive 2% in the June quarter, unchanged from the March period. In the U.S. payment volume in the June quarter was a negative 3% over the prior year, unchanged from the March period. Debit delivered a positive 5% growth, while credit growth was a negative 10%, both unchanged from the March quarter. Debit payment volume continues to account for an every greater percentage of total U.S. volume, although credit remains the prevailing choice in the rest of our regions. On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 8% in the June quarter, moderating from the 10% growth exhibited in the March quarter, but still solidly positive, a continuing recognition of the secular resiliency of plastic in many emerging and developing economies. Cross-border volume growth remained negative in the June quarter, posting an 8% decline on a constant dollar basis over the prior-year period. This represented a moderate decline from the negative 6% reported in the March period. As in the previous quarters, the slowdown remained broad-based. Transactions processed over Visa's networks, which are reported on a real-time basis, totaled $10.5 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 9% over the similar period a year ago and up slightly from the 8% growth rate we saw in the June quarter, an encouraging sign. Turning to the income statement, in our fiscal fourth quarter, gross revenues of $2.2 billion were up 10% from the similar period in 2008. Volume and support incentives, as a percentage of gross revenues, came in at 15%, down from the third quarter's elevated level of 17%. For fiscal 2009, gross revenues were $8.1 billion, up 10% over fiscal 2008. Volume and support incentives rose only 6% as a result of the lower payment volume we experienced over the course of the period. Volume and support incentives represented 15% of gross revenue for the year. Based on our expectation for increased volumes and revenue in 2010, we are expecting volume and support incentives to increase modestly to the 16% to 17% range of gross revenue. Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $1.9 billion, a 10% increase over the operating revenues reported for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008. This was ahead of the revenue guidance we provided last quarter, due to better than anticipated processed transaction growth and cross-border volume, as well as previously disclosed pricing actions. As noted earlier, full fiscal year net operating revenues were $6.9 billion, a 10% increase over 2008 and a little above our expectations.  Moving to the individual revenue line items for the fourth quarter, service revenue was $808.0 million, up 3% over the prior year period and reflective of still relatively depressed payment volumes in all regions for the quarter ending June. Data processing revenue, reported on a current quarter basis, was $727.0 million, up 33% over the prior-year period, based on strong processed transaction growth of 9% and the effect of recently announced pricing actions. International transaction revenues, also reported on a current quarter basis, were down 1%, to $507.0 million, due to moderating cross-border volumes in the period. Our adjusted operating margin was 49%, slightly below our quarter guidance of low-50s. For the entire fiscal year, the adjusted operating margin was 53%, in line with our yearly guidance. I will provide additional color on our future margin expectations in a moment. On an adjusted basis, total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $960.0 million, an increase of $17.0 million, or 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher personnel costs. For all of 2009, adjusted total operating expenses were $3.2 billion, a 4% decline from the level of fiscal 2008. While our focus on efficiency gains will continue into 2010, our expectation is that with the majoring restructuring initiatives behind us, expenses for the coming year will generally be flat to those of 2009. On a sequentially quarter basis, we saw higher expenses in several line items, including personnel and marketing. The higher personnel spend was primarily due to reorganization charges, as well as some incentive-based costs that we do not expect to recur on a go-forward basis. Marketing costs were sequentially higher as we continued to support our Internet advertising initiatives, our Gold advertising campaign, and the Currency of Progress initiative. Additionally, we incurred creative and production costs associated with the upcoming Winter Olympics and FIFA World Cup. Overall, in 2010, we anticipate spending less than $1.0 billion on marketing and advertising. In aggregate, our total expenses in the first fiscal quarter of 2010 should look more like the third quarter of fiscal 2009 rather than the fourth fiscal quarter. Capital expenditures were $101.0 million in the quarter, which substantially completes the spending on our new data center that is now completely online. For all of fiscal 2009 capital expenditures were $306.0 million, at the low end of our expectations going into the year. For fiscal 2010 we expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $200.0 million to $250.0 million. Having fully brought the new data center online, we will be realizing a higher level of depreciation and amortization in 2010 and beyond. As a point of reference, we expect that depreciation and amortization will incrementally rise by approximately $30.0 million for all of fiscal 2010. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter and the year in very strong shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash of $6.6 billion. Of this total, $1.7 billion is restricted cash, which represents amounts sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement, with another $1.0 billion that is currently uncommitted. During the fourth quarter, we made the final Discover payment under the terms of our settlement. As we discussed in our last earnings call on July 1, we began the process of unlocking up to 30% of the outstanding Class C share holdings which will help alleviate some of the share overhang as we approach the ultimate unlock date of March 25, 2011. The results of this action exceeded our expectations with 89% of the potential shares unlocked by September 30 and more than half of those shares converted into Class A shares. Now, let me comment on the trends we saw through the end of September and through the first three weeks of October. On a real-time basis, U.S. payment volume growth showed some positive signs of life during the September quarter with the overall growth rate coming in at a negative 1%, a solid improvement from the negative 3% of the June quarter. The individual month of September came in at a positive 1%, the first positive growth in a year, which was due in part to the lateness of the Labor Day holiday weekend versus the prior year. More recently, through the 21st of October, aggregate U.S. payment volume growth was a positive 3%. We are also seeing the benefits of receding headwinds in the year-over-year gasoline comparables, which will continue to unfold as we move through our first fiscal quarter of 2010. While we draw some encouragement from this data, it is still not enough for us to call an inflection point in the U.S. economy. Deconstructing the U.S. payment volume results on a real-time basis, credit volume growth ended the September quarter at a negative 9%, a slight improvement from the negative 10% posted in the June quarter. For the individual month of September, credit payment volume improved to a negative 7% rate, and through the 21st of October, improved to a negative 4%. Debit payment volume growth ended the September quarter in positive territory, posting a 7% gain, up from 5% in the June quarter. The month of September improved to a positive 9% and through October 21 has improved further to a positive 11%. Again, very encouraging trends but too early to call an inflection point. On a real-time basis, cross-border volume growth also showed some signs of improvement in the September quarter, with payment volume on a constant-dollar basis moving from June's 8% decline to a negative 5% decline. Through the 21st of October this improved further to a negative 2%. The improvement was led by North America. We have seen improvement on a nominal basis as the dollar has weakened recently in key geographies. September's monthly rate on a nominal basis was a negative 3% and improvement from the negative 15% reported in the June quarter through October 21, this has improved further to a positive 3% level of growth. As we have repeatedly stated, this is an encouraging trend, but it is still too early to call an inflection point. To give some context to the foreign exchange impacts on revenue in fiscal 2009, we believe that unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced gross revenue growth by about 3%. Our expectation for 2010 is for a relatively neutral impact to revenue growth, given our hedging activities. Processed transaction growth ended the September quarter at 9%, an improvement over the 8% we recorded in the June quarter. In the month of September that rate was a positive 10%. October to date has maintained that same level of growth and continues to be a barometer of the strength and resilience of plastic. Now let me comment on our expectations over the coming fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impacts on our guidance. As Joe mentioned earlier, we are increasingly comfortable with achieving the low end of our 11% to 15% net revenue growth target in 2010 and delivering better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010, excluding the Visa Net de Brazil gain in 2009. We are establishing a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20% and we will provide additional color at our March investor meeting. We expect our full year 2010 operating margin to be in the mid-50s, up slightly from the low-50s we achieved this year. Given economic uncertainties it is always possible that we could see an individual quarter where the margins dipped to the low-50%. Our projection for free cash flow for the year is north of $2.0 billion, which is net of the $682.0 million prepayment we made this month on the previously settled retailers' litigation.  We expect our 2010 tax rates to be in a range of 38% to 39%. Finally, on a go-forward basis, we will no longer use the adjusted format for our earnings releases and instead will rely on GAAP results. We will, of course, call out material, one-time items or other extraordinary events. With our IPO now six quarters behind us, we feel that the original objective of reporting on an adjusted basis has now been met. That concludes my comments so I will turn the call back over to Joe.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Before we move on to Q&A I wanted to provide a brief update on some of the opportunities we are focused on as we move into 2010 and we will be providing more in-depth detail at our inaugural investor day this March. We have talked a lot about these in the recent past and we remain excited about the near-term contribution of each of them. As I mentioned earlier, these include acceptance, debit and prepaid, global processing, and of course, enhancing our presence on the Internet. With acceptance we have identified four strategic objectives, which include expanding merchant acceptance, optimizing the performance of all Visa's products at the point of sale, increasing the Visa share of total sales with merchants, and finally, building sustainable partnerships with our clients through programs like co-branding. Both domestically and internationally we will continue to expand the categories of spend on plastic, both debit and credit, as well as better penetrate existing successful categories.  In the U.S. that means focusing on key growth channels like transportation and bill pay and micro payment categories such as vending. In the rest of the world, we are focused on replicating the early category successes we had here in the U.S. in grocery, QSRs, fuel, and bill pay. We talked a lot about debit, and more specifically prepaid, and continue to make a lot of progress on both fronts as some of the metrics we have spoken to in this call will attest. Our overall global debit strategy is built on expanding acceptance in everyday segments, encouraging use of the debit card at the point of sale, demonstrating acceptance benefits to merchants, improving the consumer awareness of debit via advertising, and protecting and growing our issuance. As far as prepaid is concerned, we view this as a product platform for which we will focus on specific segments to fuel continued growth. The key categories remain government disbursement, employee benefits, incentives and rebates, healthcare, and payroll. The keys to continued success in this space are expanding penetration, which is quite good in the U.S. much more nascent internationally, creating consumer preference, and most importantly, improving performance. While many of the issuance programs currently in place generate millions of cards and good payment volumes, others result in issuance of cards by little volume at the point of sale in favor of cash withdrawals of ATMs. As part and parcel of our overall debit and prepaid strategies, we are implementing programs to boost conversion rates for these programs as we have done and are doing in the U.S. In processing, we continue our focus on growing our domestic network processing, not just in the U.S. but more important, globally. To this end, we recently expanded our relationship with Wells Fargo to include a long-term debit processing agreement. We are also exploring expanding our ability to offer issuer and acquirer processing in key foreign markets where we believe we could accelerate our success by making investments in, or working with, domestic entities willing to form partnerships. Lastly, on the Internet, we continue to make progress in developing our new ecommerce solution. This solution, called Right Click by Visa, is an online shopping tool targeted to consumers that assists online shoppers by offering the ability to browse multiple merchants and select items consumers are interested in looking at in one central location, making comparison shopping easier, auto-sell capabilities that instantly populate the consumer's shipping and payment details for faster checkout, and exclusive offers for Visa cardholders and the ability to solicit feedback from friends on items the user is considering to buy. Finally, we are working on an aliasing capability that will make the safest way to pay on the Internet even better. We expect rolling out his feature by the summer of 2010. Extensive testing of Right Click has been completed and we are conducting tests with users and a limited number of U.S.-based issuers in the coming weeks. Based on user feedback, we are continuing to refine features and functionalities. We expect version 1.1 of Right Click to roll out next calendar year. With that, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jason Kupferberg - UBS Securities.\nJason Kupferberg - UBS Securities: Nice to see the top-line upside here and we appreciate the initial look at fiscal 2011. Just a quick question and a follow-up. First of all, with regard to the fiscal 2010 net revenue growth guidance, can you talk about the amount of pricing list that's assumed in there? I recognize you're going to have the U.S. acquirer price increase continue to help you for the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. If you can help us get an understanding of how much pricing is assumed in the low end of the 11% to 15% range, that would be great.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: The amount of pricing impact, we would describe as modest, less than what we experienced in 2009, but a little higher than the long-term steady rate, normalized rate, of 1% to 2% that we have described earlier. The particular pricing action that you mentioned was initiated at the beginning of fiscal 2009's fourth quarter and will anniversary through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.\nJason Kupferberg - UBS Securities: And a follow-up on volumes, really good to hear that things seem to be turning around, not that one month makes a trend, but nonetheless, if you put gas prices aside here and currency, which folks know are starting to help you here in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, are there certain spending categories that you guys are starting to see a little bit of a recovery in first, in terms of how it's driving some of the better year-over-year volume growth comps?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: We would say at this point there is no call out there and that you have outlined the two bigger drivers that are moving the needle, the removal of FX that was headwind. In the first fiscal quarter of 2010 we should start to see that neutral impact that we talked about during the call, and then the same phenomena exists for gasoline prices. Sometime in this quarter, potentially in the month of November we ought to be at the same average price for gas and we should see that headwind pretty much go to neutral as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Maurer - Calyon Securities.\nCraig Maurer - Calyon Securities: One comment, Joe, that you made at the end of your remarks that caught my attention was the discussion of investing in merchant acquiring outside the market, outside the U.S., as I always that that was a perfect fit for both the major U.S. networks outside the U.S., so I was hoping you can expand on that a little bit.\nJoseph W. Saunders: I think I told you what we are looking at or thinking about doing but as it relates to specifics I really don't think I can get into this at this particular point in time. The only thing that I will add is that when we, assuming we are looking at acquiring, we are simply looking at places in the world where doing that will accelerate the distribution of terminals and therefore accelerate our opportunities in those regions.\nCraig Maurer - Calyon Securities: And on the personnel costs, they were up quite a bit. Was that related to the opening of the data center?\nJoseph W. Saunders: No, I would say it was what we said, it was appropriate reorganization accounting and some one-time incentives. So we'll be back to normal in the first quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Hochstem - Buckingham Research.\nDavid Hochstem - Buckingham Research: I just wondered if you can talk about how the organizational structure has changed with John Partridge becoming president. [inaudible] does it make any difference?  And from the acquirer fee, the change in process of transactions of sort of 1.0% and 1.5% and the sequential increase in the fee was about 20%, is all that related to the price change?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: Let me start with the transaction fee, so the way we would look at it, the transaction fee, or data processing fees, for the quarter, year-over-year, were up 33% and we would put that, we would break that apart in two segments. The first is that we had very strong transaction growth of in the 9% range for the quarter, year-over-year and then the acquiring fee does have an amplified impact on data processing fees. So think of the balance as pricing actions, in combination with strong transaction growth.\nDavid Hochstem - Buckingham Research: So the $100.0 million sequential increase, roughly, or over that from Q3 to Q4 is kind of a\u2014Q4 is kind of run rate and it should go up as volumes go up then?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: It directly relates to volumes. There is a mix\u2014no, there really isn't a mix. It should have a correlation to volume and then of course we have got to let the pricing actions run their course.\nDavid Hochstem - Buckingham Research: And with respect to John?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, John is the President, he's no longer the Chief Operating Officer because he is the President. But in reorganizing, the title is more appropriate given the responsibilities he has. But we won't be hiring a COO.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan: The revenues came in nicely, ahead of our view, but certain expense lines came in a bit higher than we forecast. You talked about personnel, I was wondering, was there any pro-forward of discretionary spending, particularly in the professional, the consulting fee line? I think the admin and other lines, those also looked like they stepped up a bit sequentially.\nJoseph W. Saunders: The professional fees were consistent with the strategic projects that we're investing in. There was an extraordinary expenditure in marketing that really wasn't, even though our guidance suggested that the marketing spend would go up, it wasn't really part of it. We accelerated the creation of the creative for the Currency of Progress for the Winter Olympics and to some extent for FIFA. So we spent some money on creative development and marketing that we didn't necessarily intend to or didn't guide to, I guess is a better word. And as it relates to the personnel expenses, as I said before, there were some reorganization and incentive expenses that were extraordinary and are now behind us.\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan: So just to make sure, the flat comment on operating expense growth, is the right base line the adjusted expense number of $3.238 billion in fiscal 2009? Is that the right base line?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: No. Remember, I said on the earnings call, we are moving to a GAAP comparison. So from this point forward everything should be looked at on a GAAP-to-GAAP basis. We are excluding any impact from Visa Net Brazil. Other than that, starting with the first quarter, and this was consistent with our guidance, flat expense, GAAP result, year-over-year.\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan: Just the buybacks. Nice to see that. What's the general philosophy for buying back stock?\nJoseph W. Saunders: When you say general philosophy, the general philosophy is that we return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends or buyback. Can you be a little more specific?\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan: I was wondering if you are going to utilize the buyback opportunistically, or will there be some kind of systemic approach to retiring the shares?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Yes, it will be systematically opportunistic. With the emphasis on the latter. Very disciplined, very disciplined opportunistic buyback. We will use open market and 10b5-1s and we have a 12-month life on the program.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott.\nThomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott: I have a question on volume and support and sense of guidance of 16% to 17% for fiscal 2010. What's baked into that in regards to expectations around payment volumes, so if volumes pick up a little above your expectations, should we expect that guidance to move a little bit, i.e. go down or how fixed is that guidance, 16% to 17%?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: If we go back to our original IPO guidance, we said we expected volume and support incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be in that 16% to 18% range, so the first thing I would say, this is very consistent with how we thought about this at the time of the IPO and at the time of the IPO we thought of incentives moving up for two reasons, one of which is that it is a very specific strategy of Visa to enter into more multi-year contracts with our client and it is through a multi-year contract that you actually create incentives, because that's the quid pro quo for more than annual commitment to the card processor. So more companies, more clients, under multi-year contract as time progresses. And then second, as the economies begin to recover, as our clients' credit portfolios in particular, begin to recover and grow over the preceding year, we would expect a higher rate of incentives to be earned. And if you blend those two together, our outlook, which supports payment volumes that would get us into the low end of the 11% to 15% revenue growth range, would get you incentives in that 16% to 17% range.\nJoseph W. Saunders: But as you ask and as we have consistently said, to some extent those incentives are based on volumes and anticipate that there will be some increase in volumes.\nThomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott: Are there any plans to publish the operating metrics on kind of a real-time basis in 2010?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: I'm not quite sure what you're referring to. We do regularly publish operational data that would have\u2014just been issued, we do it on a quarterly basis, which is reasonably extensive on debit and credit, and is done on a global basis. It excludes, of course, Visa Europe, which is not part of Visa Inc. Is there something beyond you're asking about?\nThomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott: Yes, the operational performance data that is published in connection with the [inaudible] on a one-quarter lag.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: We expect to address that in fiscal year 2010, specifically the removement of the lag on reporting service fee revenues.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: The marketing spend in 2010, talking about less than $1.0 billion, which is kind of what we expected but it's still below what you spent in 2008 and 2007. Can you give a little color, if you're actually\u2014I know you have some synergies or consolidations\u2014but are you actually marketing less than you did in 2007 and 2008 or are you marketing more?\nJoseph W. Saunders: I think that the effect of what we're doing is the same effect that we had a couple of years ago. It's just that we're doing it smarter. And I mean, you have a lot of things going on. We have more digital advertising that's supported by print. We have a little less TV, particularly in the United States and frankly, television rates in the United States are down. They're a little bit more expensive outside the U.S. but I would say the mix between TV and print and digital and the consolidation of our marketing efforts in a single buying entity, a single creative thrust, I mean, all of that put together, we're getting to the same number of people in a more effective manner.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: You talked about prepaids, any chance you will give us feel for how much spending? Prepaid is all in the debit category, correct?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Yes.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Can you give us any feel for the size of that business?\nJoseph W. Saunders: I think that we will be able to do a much better job of talking about prepaid and some of these other things at our investor day, so that's a good lead in. I look forward to seeing you in March.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Corporate spend, any pick up in corporate spend? Corporate card.\nJoseph W. Saunders: It's something that we're aggressively pursuing, and obviously we need to pursue that through financial institutions, but you will see us more after the net market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus : One clarification, the depreciation and amortization guidance, up $30.0 million throughout fiscal 2010, was that included in your total expense number being flattish?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: Yes.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus : And a broader question for you, Joe. I sort of share your interchange views that you shared with us on the call, but I wanted to know, just hypothetically, do you feel like the Welch Bill and some of the restrictions and issues like that, is that more of a threat than some of the [inaudible] and driven approach, in your opinion.\nJoseph W. Saunders: No, not at all. I mean, that may sound like the simple answer but it's the right answer.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus : Can you explain why?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Fewer people embrace it and it has less traction than anything else that's out there and it's starting at a place that's way in back of where a lot of other things began and just the history of this entire dialogue would suggest that my answer is appropriate.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus : You mentioned that the brand spending is no longer as big a part of your marketing budget, but then you also talked about renewing with the NFL and FIFA and the Olympics. Can you give us an idea at all how much of your marketing budget is brand spend?\nJoseph W. Saunders: I think probably, when everything is said and done, it's around 30%. But remember, even with the NFL, and when you see the Olympic ads, these are going to be more action-oriented ads. These are going to be ads that ask people to spend. The NFL ads will have use your Visa card and go to the Super Bowl. The Olympic ads will have a usage component associated with them. So even these sponsorships are not going to be entirely aspirationally brand driven.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse: I notice in the context of a pretty large revenue beat, the card service fees was actually a little below our expectations in the rate, as a percent of volume was down, partially offset I guess by less incentives. But is there anything going on there in terms of customer mix or something like that that you could highlight?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: In service fees, remember this is on a one-quarter lag, so service revenues were up 3% and if you look at the [inaudible] volume growth on a constant dollar basis, it's a plus 2. And on a nominal basis it's a minus 2. So it's a beat but it's in the same zip code. And I would say it's a combination of pricing adjustments and of mix shifts.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams.\nGreg Smith - Duncan-Williams: You quantified, in the personnel expense, the $33.0 million of restructuring, but correct me if I'm wrong, you said in addition to that there was some one-time incentive payments. If that's correct, what was the actual\u2014can you quantify that at all?\nJoseph W. Saunders: They're both part of the same thing. They're not additive.\nGreg Smith - Duncan-Williams: That's all in the $33.0 million?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: There is a restructuring charge that is related to activities that are tied to the merger of the five businesses that occurred back in October of 2007. This is the last quarter that we will be calling out restructuring charges and that's the $30.0-something million that is below the adjusted line. In the personnel costs that are included in our adjusted results, as Joe mentioned earlier, there are some reorganization costs and some incentive costs that we do not expect to reoccur and therefore the first quarter 2010 personnel costs, or all in costs, should be much closer to say, what you saw in Q3 as opposed to Q4.\nGreg Smith - Duncan-Williams: And can you talk a little bit about launching debit in Canada? Do you have a specific time table for rolling that out? And is there anything you need to do from a merchant acceptance standpoint to accept a Visa debit in Canada?\nJoseph W. Saunders: We are making progress in that regard and we expect to gain traction and begin issuing cards. I would say that the build-up of the merchants' acceptance will take some time but I believe that the die is cast and that the effort is underway. And I think over the moderate term it will be quite successful. The first cards that come out in Canada, the first debit cards, with Visa logos, which will come out in the first quarter of 2010, will be dual-branded cards. So it will carry the traditional Canadian debit logo along with the Visa logo. I think it will be a great product. I think it will be a big win and we're excited about it and looking forward to it.\nGreg Smith - Duncan-Williams: And one last clarification. So going forward, Byron, you're only going to report GAAP so for example, the $17.0 million this quarter of step-up amortization, you won't be adding that back, you'll just be reporting GAAP?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: Yes, that's correct.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank.\nChristopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Just going back to your comments about pricing being somewhat higher than the normalized 1% to 2% contribution for fiscal 2010, is that all\u2014is that solely related to the new pricing or is there anything else in there sort of contemplated and maybe give us a timing?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: It's primarily related to the acquirers fee that we took starting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009.\nChristopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Could you comment on what you're seeing early on or expectations for holiday spending trends, particularly in light of the [inaudible] consumer confidence numbers today?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: To be helpful, what we've done is giving you our real-time spending trends through October 21 and we will let you extrapolate from there.\nJoseph W. Saunders: It's not the traditional holiday season although there are a lot of Christmas trees around already.\nChristopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank: You made some positive comments on anticipating the results of GAO. Has the GAO approached you directly for input?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Oh, absolutely. There is absolutely no question about that. We have had quite a bit of communication with the GAO, which is not to say that they haven't had conversations with other people, but absolutely. We had conversations with them when they are in the midst of doing the previous study that they did and our relationship with them has continued.\nOperator: Your final question comes from James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group: I'm just trying to test the cyclical versus secular for credit versus debit. As we move through the cycle and economies potentially recover, would you expect debit will continue to grow as a percentage of transaction volume in 2010?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Yes, in 2010. Absolutely. I don't think there is any question about that for a lot of reasons, not all of them being secular, but secular is certainly part of it.\nJack Carsky: Thank you all again for joining us today. If anybody has further follow-up questions, feel free to give myself or Victoria a call.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call."}, {"symbol": "V", "quarter": 3, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-07-29 20:35:36", "content": "Executives: Jack Carsky - Investor Relations Joseph W.

Saunders: Thanks, Jack and thank you all for joining us. To begin, I am pleased to report that our fiscal third quarter results were once again consistent with the guidance and expectations we provided during our second quarter earnings call. Despite the ongoing challenges in the economy, Visa delivered a solid operational and financial performance as we continued to benefit from our diverse product set, our ongoing commitment to expense management, and of course the underlying worldwide secular shift from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment.  Earnings for the third quarter on an adjusted basis were $0.98 per diluted share, and were positively impacted by the sale of our 10% equity ownership in Visa Net Brazil. On an adjusted pro forma basis that excludes this gain, Visa earned $0.67 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the year-ago period. This puts us on target towards meeting our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of better than 20% growth.  Our net operating revenues in the third quarter were over $1.6 billion, a modest increase over the year-ago period and in line with our previous guidance for low single-digit growth.  Partly, we were able to achieve this result while incurring elevated volume and support incentives which were due to the successful resigning of numerous clients during the quarter, a situation we do not expect to repeat at these levels.  Our adjusted operating margin was 51% for the quarter as we continued to benefit from our ongoing efficiency drive.  Finally, adjusted third quarter net income was $744 million. Absent the gain from Visa Net Brazil sale, it was $507 million, an 11% increase over the year-ago period.  Our fiscal quarter picked up pretty much where we left off in the second quarter. We have seen no signs that a sustained turnaround in the U.S. is occurring. There are, however, positive incremental exceptions which speak to the resiliency of Visa\u2019s business model and the value Visa offers around the globe.  U.S. payment volume growth declined to a 3% negative rate in the quarter. We continue to be encouraged that since the beginning of the calendar year, payment volume growth has remained in a relatively tight range around a negative 2% to 4%.  Of note in the U.S., the more than 30% decline in the year-over-year price of gasoline continues to make for difficult year-over-year comparables. Absent this headwind in the latest quarter, we would have seen slightly positive growth. However, we still expect this headwind to abate as we move into the first quarter of our fiscal 2010.  On the other hand, in spite of the global nature of the recession, aggregate payment volume growth in our international regions, which is primarily driven by credit, was positive on a constant currency basis in the March quarter and has remained positive in the high-single-digits through the end of June, albeit at a lower level than earlier in the year.  Total transactions generating data processing fees were $10.3 billion for the June quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period as the migration to electronic payments continues on a global basis.  As I did last quarter, let me underscore and reiterate several important themes you should take away from our most recent quarter and this call. Our financial performance in fiscal 2009 continues to unfold consistent with our expectations and more importantly, it reflects the appropriate funding of all of our growth initiatives.  We believe that we are planting the right seeds and making the proper investments in the business to come out of this recession in an even stronger position than we entered it.  Our business model, while not unaffected, has proven resilient in the face of today\u2019s economic challenges. Transaction growth led by debit has continued unabated, in part driven by the secular shift from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment.  Visa is also driving this global shift in spending behavior through its reliability and accessibility, product innovation, expansion of payment categories, and focused global advertising that moves consumers to want to transact at the point of sale with Visa products.  In fact, the early results from our Go campaign first rolled out in April of this year are exceeding our initial expectations in terms of increased consumer awareness and brand [linkage], providing a level of optimism that the campaign is contributing to our strong debit transaction growth.  On the positive side, based on current trends we are now anticipating a slightly better fiscal fourth quarter. We believe that the low-single-digit expectation we previously guided to is more likely to be in the mid-single-digit range. This leaves us quite confident in achieving the high-single-digit revenue range for all of fiscal 2009.  Looking ahead to fiscal 2010, we continue to believe that we can regain our 11% to 15% annual net revenue growth target based on the assumptions we shared with you last quarter. The more favorable year-over-year comparison on gas prices and foreign exchange rates and the start of some recovery in the U.S. economy and cross-border volumes by early 2010.  We also continue to believe that we are able to achieve our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating margin targets even if the revenue growth was somewhat below the guidance range.  Now let me touch on some of the recent successes we\u2019ve had on the client front. As we\u2019ve discussed with you for several quarters now, consolidations in the banking industry have changed the landscape and market share of many of our largest customers. Given the strength of our client relationships and our products, we anticipated being a net beneficiary of this consolidation and I can now say with certainty that we have delivered on that expectation.  In our third fiscal quarter, we resigned a significant number of long-term contracts, 11 of which collectively account for 26% of our global volume and 34% of our U.S. volume. Some of these contracts were accelerated renewals and were precipitated by bank consolidation.  With these signings, we now have no major contracts up for renewal in the next two years and have over 75% of our worldwide payment volume under contract. We are obviously pleased about our long-term prospects and are well-positioned to execute on our business objective under various economic scenarios.  We are especially grateful for our clients, for their support and I am personally grateful to our customer sales and support teams around the world for their hard work.  And finally, with respect to our client-facing teams, earlier this week I announced a new streamlined management structure to achieve greater alignment between our sales, customer support, marketing, and product development functions.  By integrating these business units under a single leader, we expect to speed decision-making and increased responsiveness to clients and be better positioned to monitor strategic investment opportunities.  With that, let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the detail of our financial results. \nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: Thank you, Joe. As is now our custom, let me begin with the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter and then I will touch on trends we are seeing for the quarter ending in June, as well as some early results for July.  As Joe previously mentioned, it was a solid fiscal third quarter with strong revenue and earnings growth in line with our guidance in spite of higher-than-anticipated rebates and incentives. And of course, we benefited from the sale of our equity interest in Visa Net Brazil.  Total payment volume growth for Visa Inc. through the end of March 2009 in nominal dollars was a negative 5% over the same quarter in 2008. On a constant dollar basis, however, volume grew 2%.  In the U.S., payment volumes in the March ending quarter declined to a negative 3%, with debit delivering a solid 5% growth while credit growth was a negative 10%. Proportionately, debit payment volume continued to account for a greater percentage of total U.S. volume, although credit still remains the payment vehicle of choice in the rest of our regions.  On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 10% in the March ending quarter, moderating from the 14% growth exhibited in the December quarter but still solidly positive, a further recognition of the secular resiliency of plastic in many emerging and developing economies.  Cross-border volume growth first turned negative in the March ending quarter, posting a 6% decline on a constant dollar basis. Through the end of the June quarter, the rate of decline moderated and ended the period at a negative 8% growth rate. As in prior quarters, the slow down was broad-based.  Transactions processed over Visa's network, which are reported on a real-time basis, totaled $10.3 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 8% over the similar period a year ago and an increase from the 6% growth we saw in the previous quarter. Also, revenues from processed transactions, which currently generate approximately 30% of our gross revenue, continued to post solid growth as the underlying secular shift to Visa electronic payments continues. We also saw little variance in average ticket sizes, which are down 10% from the prior year period but on a sequential quarter basis appear to have leveled off.  Turning to the income statement, in the fiscal third quarter, gross revenues of $2 billion were up 5% from the similar periods in 2008. As Joe previously mentioned, volume and support incentives were elevated during the quarter due to the renewals of key customer contracts, several of which were accelerated due to bank consolidation.  All told, volume and support incentives increased on a year-over-year basis by $70 million to $344 million, representing 17% of gross revenue in the period and 15% of gross revenue year-to-date.  Given these results, we are updating our full-year expectation for volume and support incentives to be at the high-end of our 14% to 16% range. We will provide our outlook from 2010 in our fourth quarter earnings call. Net operating revenues were just over $1.6 billion, a 2% increase over the operating revenues reported for the third fiscal quarter of 2008 and in line with the revenue guidance we provided last quarter.  Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $769 million, up 3% over the prior year period and reflective of still moderating year-over-year payment volumes in all regions for the quarter ending March.  Data processing revenue, reported on a current basis, was $605 million, up 12% over the prior period as processed transactions continued to post solid growth in the quarter.  International transaction revenues, also reported on a current quarter basis, were up 2% to $458 million, as moderating cross-border volumes in the period were offset by some regional strategic pricing modifications.  Our adjusted operating margin was 51%, in line with our low 50s margin guidance for all of 2009. I\u2019ll provide additional color on our future margin expectations in a moment.  On an adjusted basis, operating expenses for the third quarter declined $79 million, or 9% year over year, driven by lower costs in personnel, marketing and professional fees.  Our focus on expense reduction continues to be broad-based and driven by merger related efficiencies. As expected, there was an up-tick in marketing spend in the quarter on a sequential basis, and we expect to see a similar step up in the fourth fiscal quarter.  Capital expenditures were $69 million in the quarter and included spend on our new data center, which will be completely online by the end of our fiscal year. With year-to-date capital expenditures running a little above $200 million, we now foresee full-year capital expenditures at around $300 million.  Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter in excellent shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash of $6.1 billion. Of this total, $1.6 billion is restricted cash, which represents amounts sufficient to fully pay out the American Express and Discover settlement. It also includes approximately $300 million that is current uncommitted, which was increased to just over $1 billion on the 16th of July in accordance with our previously announced litigation escrow funding event.  As we did last December, this funding was simply another way of buying back our stock while providing the added benefit of reducing the eventual B class overhang when the shares are ultimately unlocked. This latest repurchase will reduce our period end outstanding share count by 11.6 million shares for the fiscal fourth quarter ending this September.  On July 1st, we began the process of unlocking up to 30% of the outstanding Class B shareholdings, which will help alleviate some of the share overhang as we approach the ultimate unlock date of March 25, 2011. Through this point in July, we have already had approximately 41% of the potentially available shares requested to be unlocked.  Now let me comment on the trends we are seeing that will impact our results in the final quarter of fiscal 2009. Specifically here in the U.S., payment volume growth improved slightly from a negative 3% growth rate in the March quarter to a negative 2% growth in the June ending quarter. Deconstructing this further, credit volume growth ended the period at a negative 10% while debit volume growth continued in positive territory, posting a 5% gain.  More recently, through the 26th of July, aggregate U.S. payment volume growth was a negative 3%. Credit growth continues at a negative 10% while debit growth is a positive 4% July month-to-date.  While we still see no signs of a true inflection point, these trends are encouraging. Furthermore, they are consistent with the performance we have seen over the past six months suggesting some level of stability.  Outside the U.S. for the quarter ending June 2009, we expect constant dollar payment volume growth rates to be solidly positive but to have declined modestly from their levels at the end of March.  As mentioned earlier, cross-border volumes in constant dollars were down a negative 6% in the March ending quarter and in the June quarter have declined to negative 8%. Month-to-date in July, the rate of decline has improved slightly to a negative 7%. More importantly, the velocity of the downturn has slowed, which is encouraging but it is still too early to call an inflection point.  Process transaction growth ended the June period at 8%, while month-to-date in July it has increased to 9%. This metric continues to be testament to the strength and resilience of debit as a greater percentage of process transactions are debit based.  Now let me comment on what we see over the coming quarter as far as our operating performance is concerned and how it affects our guidance. Based on our fiscal third quarter results and our improved fourth quarter outlook, we now believe fourth quarter revenue growth is more likely to be in the mid-single-digit range and we are confident in delivering net revenue growth in the high-single-digits for 2009.  And as Joe mentioned, this outlook encompasses a continued negative foreign exchange impact which on a year-over-year basis impacted revenue growth by about five percentage points in the third quarter and will likely be in the 4% to 5% range in the fourth quarter.  Given the strong adjusted operating margin exhibited this quarter, and our current outlook for 2010, we are adjusting up our 2010 guidance to the low 50% range from the prior range of high 40s to low 50s. Given the uncertain economy, it is always possible that we could see a quarter where the margin dips below 50% but on a fiscal year basis, we are comfortable with the low 50s.  Finally and most importantly, as Joe said, we remain on track to deliver 2009 adjusted earnings per share growth of greater than 20%. And looking to fiscal 2010, we remain unchanged in our view that given a scenario that includes some recovery in the U.S. economy and in cross-border travel combined with more favorable comparisons in gas prices and foreign exchange rates, we would expect to exceed 20% earnings per share growth.  Of course, we are excluding the Visa Net Brazil gain in this calculation, which won\u2019t be replicated in 2010.  That concludes my comments so I will turn the call back over to Joe. \nJoseph W. Saunders: Thanks, Byron. Let me conclude with a review of some of the newer initiatives we are involved in. Earlier today we jointly announced with U.S. Bank the creation of a joint venture, Syncada, which will provide a global electronic business-to-business financial supply chain network. The joint venture expands our commercial product offerings and increases our participation in the B-to-B payment space as we continue to add services that deliver value to our financial institution clients around the world.  Also, at the end of June, we previously announced that we had entered into a strategic alliance and would be taking an equity stake in [Monetize], the United Kingdom based leader in the mobile financial services. This provides us with a development partner for our comprehensive suite of mobile services and highlights the fact that we are making the proper investments in technologies that we believe will be relevant to the future of electronic payments.  These types of strategic alliances and investments, coupled with the numerous partnerships, pilots, and commercialized programs that we are running around the globe today, will ensure that Visa and Visa Net remain the electronic payment system of choice for issuers, businesses, governments, and consumers the world over.  We also continue to make very nice headway in the prepaid space, not only here in the U.S. but in a number of regions globally. Prepaid, which is a natural extension of our already successful debit presence, is a business that we have been in for quite some time in the U.S. and in which we are seeing enormous opportunity internationally.  Domestically we currently run 66 different programs with 38 states for government disbursements. In the healthcare arena, seven of the top 10 insurance companies offer Visa spending account cards.  Other important categories in which we are active and have been quite successful include gift cards, general purpose reloadable cards, and payroll programs, to name a few.  In the U.S., we believe this is a $1 trillion potential market while globally it could be as high as $3 trillion. Stacked up against worldwide Visa payment volume for the 12 months through March of $2.7 trillion, it\u2019s easy to see that even a nominal penetration of this market could be needle moving for us.  The largest opportunity globally is penetrating the under-banked segment with general purposed reloadable cards. The under-banked includes both the under-served, those who don\u2019t have access to mainstream financial services, and those that choose for a wide variety of reasons alternative financial services.  In the U.S., about $80 million individuals fall into the under-banked category. Globally the under-banked may be a majority of consumers. Our success in debit in the U.S. should provide key advantages as we further penetrate the prepaid space.  Lastly, we continue to make progress on enhancing our already dominant presence on the Internet. While we have a commanding 48% payment volume share on the net, our ultimate goal is for an ever-increasing number of consumers to recognize that the fastest, safest, and easiest way to transact online is with a Visa branded product.  To that end, among other upgrades, we are on the cusp of rolling out an enhanced consumer platform that will ultimately assist Internet shoppers in three ways. First, pre-purchase activities like a best price search capability; second, check-out activities like aliasing and auto form fill; and third, post-purchase capabilities like tracking and shipping.  We\u2019ll have more to say about this in the coming months and look forward to updating you further on our next quarter\u2019s call.  With that, we are ready to take questions. Operator. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: Thanks. Great results. Actually I was hoping to ask two questions, one business and one high level question. Just for some of the incentives, good news on the resignings. A couple of questions here -- any surprises here in terms of the demand that you are getting from the banks, you know, up-front payments or ongoing payments, et cetera? And then secondly, I know you are not going to give us guidance here until fiscal \u201910 but directionally, can we assume that we will see some relief in rebates in fiscal \u201910 in relation to fiscal \u201909, Byron, given the acceleration in the renewals?\nJoseph W. Saunders: I think that it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve achieved the objective that we set out to achieve. I think we\u2019ve done it well within the parameters of our expectations. I think that the transactions that we\u2019ve consummated have been good both for our clients and for ourselves. We said in the script that there was a somewhat elevated level of incentives this quarter as a result of that that we wouldn\u2019t expect to continue, so I think that everything that is going to happen in 2010 is pretty well embraced in the re-affirmation of our guidance that we made earlier in the call. \nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: And I would just add that the incentive levels going forward should be more a function of the growth rates in the client portfolios, which are directly linked to the level of incentives we report. \nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: Okay, got it. I think it\u2019s a good outcome for sure. And Joe, I just wanted to ask, obviously a lot of focus out there on the regulatory risk, specifically around interchange and the possibility of some reductions there. I\u2019m not suggesting that anything is going to happen but I just wanted to ask, under a hypothetical scenario where interchange is regulated and let\u2019s say it\u2019s cut in a meaningful way, what kind of impact would that have on Visa? Specifically, would you expect your fees to indirectly come under some pressure as well? And also, what kind of impact could it have on volumes and the whole idea of the secular growth of card based payments, would there have -- would that have some influence on that as well? We obviously get that question quite a bit from investors. \nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, first of all I don\u2019t think that the situation that you describe is going to happen. We are confident that the legislators and the regulators understand that interchange is a pro-competitive structure, that it exists in every payment system around the globe and where there has been governmental intervention, that the consumer is the one that has suffered.  I think that it\u2019s also pretty obvious that merchants get, for a fairly reasonable cost, they get tremendous value. They get guaranteed payments, they get increased speed, they get better security, they get ticket lift -- just to name a few. And our discussions in Washington, D.C. suggest that the legislators now appreciate that there would probably be a significant negative unintended consequence from any congressional action on interchange.  That being said, there are actions that could occur in interchange which I do not believe would substantially affect us as it relates to our guidance or our notion of where Visa is going in the future. I suppose that if they eliminated interchange, which no one has ever even come close to suggesting in any scenario, that it would certainly create a reluctance by financial institutions to support electronic transactions to the extent that they do today.  But our biggest risk, to the extent that there is a risk, lies in the diminution of volume. I mean, if our volume were to go down, then obviously our revenues would go down. But once again, I don\u2019t think that this will happen. Secondly, you are talking about the United States and our volume is growing more outside of the United States than within the United States right now, so there\u2019s a whole number of factors that you would have to get your arms around and I think in the end, you\u2019d feel pretty good about Visa and Visa's prospects. \nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: Very good. Thanks for that, Joe. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Harding with Barclays.\nBruce Harding - Barclays Capital: Is the -- do you still feel as strongly as you did in that previous quarter conference call about the dollar, the currency impact and the gas price impact and when you project the increase from this year to next year in terms of revenue growth, and you mentioned that this year you still expect to achieve high-single-digit despite 500 basis points of currency impact, is the key assumption that the currency impact goes away completely next year and you get a tailwind? \nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: Let me respond to that -- we do have a good measurement of this impact and just to repeat, we feel that it was 500 basis points impact this quarter, this just completed quarter. We estimate 400 to 500 basis points. We hedge 17 currencies so -- and we have been hedging on a rolling basis throughout this past year, so we will -- we are confident that we will be able to bring a level of stability to our -- to FX rates in the coming year which, when compared to the rates that we\u2019ve experience this past year, give us a high degree of confidence that the headwind that we\u2019ve experienced this year will be substantially mitigated.  Second, with regard to gas prices, the June -- the month of June hit the high point in terms of average price per gas, for gallon of gas. We are starting by the first quarter, by November we should have -- actually in October and November, we are tracking to have a much more favorable compare with regard to gas prices and all the forecasts with regard to future gas pricing support that.  So with regard to our guidance going forward on those two factors, we\u2019re pretty comfortable. \nBruce Harding - Barclays Capital: Thanks and Byron, the numbers you gave for July, you said that despite the fact that we are still well into negative territory, you feel encouraged. Is that because -- you say you are encouraged because unemployment keeps going higher and yet these numbers seem to be stabilizing despite that? And do you think the issuing banks have done most of the adjusting that they -- or you know, the process A to the weakening economy and higher unemployment and B, the legislation, do you think from what you\u2019ve seen in terms of looking at your slide on credit cards outstanding that -- you know, where are we in that process by the issuing banks of downsizing their credit card portfolios in favor of perhaps more debit?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: Let me focus on the first part of your question -- what\u2019s giving us confidence, and the take here is that we have guided to low-single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter. We have now moved that up to mid-single-digit guidance in the fourth quarter. What\u2019s giving us a little bit more bullish view -- first of all, as you\u2019ll recall, our service fees are booked on a one quarter lag basis and our service fees directly relate to payment volume that -- and in that regard, the payment volume for the June quarter is substantially [known], so 40% of our revenue for the fourth quarter related to service fees, is now highly estimable. What we have seen is that payment volume, the growth rate in payment volume in the U.S. dropped to minus 2, a little bit better than what we thought and the rest of world is holding up a bit better than what we had forecasted. That\u2019s service fees. On cross border, what we have noticed is that not knowing what the trajectory was going to be, we made certain assumptions. The June quarter, ending quarter went to minus 8. We had originally forecasted something that was a bit lower than that and what we are seeing in July, with the month of July nearly complete, we are at minus 7, so a bit better.  And then turning to transactions, if you look at the trajectory, in quarter two we had 6% transaction growth. In quarter three, June ending quarter, we had plus 8 with July just about in the record books, we\u2019re at plus 9.  So when you put those three perspectives together, that\u2019s really the impetus for our change in view and why we\u2019ve moved it from low-single-digits up to mid-single-digits. \nJoseph W. Saunders: Yeah, the only thing I would add to that is to continue to remember that a lot of our transactional increases were being driven by our debit volume, not our credit volume. The credit volume is already off substantially and none of our projections suggest that it is going to come back, come roaring back in any way, shape, or form. And then finally, we keep reminding everyone that our international transactions, our international credit volume is growing. \nBruce Harding - Barclays Capital: Thank you. Byron, were you going to comment on that other, about the issuing banks or that\u2019s it?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: That\u2019s it. \nBruce Harding - Barclays Capital: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of David Hochstem with Buckingham Research.\nDavid Hochstem - Buckingham Research: Joe, could you just provide a little more color on the operational organizational changes that you announced this week and what benefits you expect to realize in terms of product rollout and interaction with customers, and what Mr. Morris will be doing?\nJoseph W. Saunders: So let me start off -- to answer the first part of your question, we are putting the product development function in with the marketing and sales and I think it will make the organization more effective, and I think that Hans would definitely agree with that.  As it relates to Hans, Hans has made a substantial contribution to this organization. I mean, it\u2019s really something else when you think about where we started out and where we are now and his contributions to the IPO, his contributions to our relationship with Visa Europe, his contributions to organizing our international organization. And so I would say that as time went on, his notion of a succession or how that might go changed somewhat and that led to conversations about the organization that we just talked about, that he was fully supportive of and so I think that we both decided that he\u2019d be best served -- or he decided that he\u2019d be best served by pursuing some other opportunities, and so I\u2019m a huge supporter of his and I\u2019m sure that he will be quite successful. He is on our payroll until December. He is contributing on a daily basis and he is sitting right here and I see him shaking his head and I don\u2019t see anything -- \nUnidentified Participant:  Nodding my head. \nJoseph W. Saunders: He\u2019s nodding his head, so I would say that that\u2019s what the answer is. \nDavid Hochstem - Buckingham Research: Okay, and in terms of just operations -- I mean, does this speed time to market for new products or --\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, look, I mean, we have a commitment to our investors that we are going to keep refining our model and be -- and that we are going to continually become a better company, that we are going to become quicker to market, we are going to be a little bit more decisive, we are going to be very introspective about what we invest in and what we don\u2019t invest in. We are going to be looking to the future to make sure that we do things appropriately and that we don\u2019t get the rug pulled out from under us two or three years from now.  And so I think -- we\u2019re talking about part of the process here. I mean, this isn\u2019t a revolution, it\u2019s part of an evolution and so far I think it\u2019s gone quite well and I would expect it to continue. \nDavid Hochstem - Buckingham Research: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.\nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs : Great, thanks. Byron, just one point of clarification -- is the guidance for fiscal fourth quarter, is that a gross number or net number for revenues? \nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: Net revenue gross, mid-single-digits. \nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs : Got it, and then 400 to 500 basis points of drag, correct? Of currency drag?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: Correct. \nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs : Got it. And then just in terms of marketing initiatives and spend, looking to the World Cup next year, how do we think about how quickly that has to ramp up in terms of spending, or is that spending behind you? Just as a major initiative next year, how will that ramp through your advertising and marketing numbers?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: So to be helpful on this, what we\u2019ve said in our opening remarks is that there is a -- there was a bit of a marketing lift in this quarter, a bit of a marketing lift expected in the fourth quarter. But no call out relative to World Cup because we are lapping an Olympic year and there are natural trade-outs that we make and substitutions as we have premiere events to marquee. And so no call out on World Cup and you\u2019ve got some guidance to finish up the year in marketing. \nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs : Okay, got it. And then lastly, if I try to sort of bridge the gap between the volume assumptions that you\u2019ve already shared with us, the currency, any way to get a sense on what the implied pricing would be, either on the cross border side or on the other side of your business, card services or data processing fees?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: I think what we\u2019ve said is we are in the later stages of the more step function type pricing adjustment and that this will be a more modest contributor going forward, that we\u2019ll grow this business the old fashioned way, which is through payment volume and transaction growth. \nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Calyon Securities.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities: Good evening. One question about Visa Europe -- we\u2019re hearing through our contacts in Europe that Visa Europe is really playing up the independence card, you know, we are owned by European banks for European banks, so we\u2019re not associated with the big bad U.S. company, so you should sign with us and oh, by the way, we\u2019ll pay for your conversions. But the European banks are a little concerned that there is the option to sell themselves back to Visa Inc. and that that might be coming quickly if they do a conversion, so I was just wondering if there\u2019s any additional conversations with Visa Europe regarding them becoming part of Visa Inc. \nJoseph W. Saunders: Most of the time when I think about them exercising the put, I think about it because somebody asks me about it, but other than that I don\u2019t think about it much.  There is nothing in the relationship between ourselves and Visa Europe that would suggest that they are about ready to exercise the put, or even thinking about it. I think that we are running the company as Visa Inc., which is what we\u2019ve always intended to, and that\u2019s about as far as I can go right now. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities: Okay. If I can just follow-up -- have you seen any traction in your money transfer initiatives, as I know the network is capable now of processing money transfers on any Visa card to any terminal?\nJoseph W. Saunders: We\u2019ll be talking a lot more about that when we get into our next quarter call and some of our guidance for the future. I mentioned the prepaid cards which fit into the whole notion of money transfer in a big way. It\u2019s part of our plans. I am sure you\u2019ve seen that we have associated ourselves with Moneygram and Western Union and so there are the beginnings of looking at this very carefully and deciding where we want to go. But I\u2019m just not ready to talk about it publicly. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities: Okay. Thanks, Joe. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.\nDan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: I just have a couple of quick questions, the first of which is as you think about growth in some of the emerging markets where you maybe don\u2019t have as large a market presence and notoriety, have you considered acquiring processors or joint ventures with processors in those markets, and would you be open to that?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, yes. \nDan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Should we expect something in the next couple of quarters?\nJoseph W. Saunders: We\u2019ve talked about it and we\u2019ve thought about it and we\u2019ve looked at it. \nDan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: And it\u2019s something that you would be positively disposed to doing?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, I wouldn\u2019t think about it and look at it and talk about it if I wasn\u2019t somewhat disposed to doing it. \nDan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Let me ask you another question -- do you think you\u2019ve got to have global consumer credit expansion in order to continue to drive growth there, given it\u2019s such a credit focused rest of world? Or can you continue to kind of penetrate debit in those markets using some of your tricks from the U.S.?\nJoseph W. Saunders: I think it is our intention to penetrate markets with the debit product. I also think it\u2019s important though to make sure that everybody understands that the credit market outside the United States is not exactly the same as the credit market in the United States. And in fact, there are many credit products outside the United States that are probably -- that probably have more similarity to a debit product than you might expect. So it\u2019s a little bit different.  But I think we are well-positioned along the entire spectrum, all the way from preloaded cards to premium credit cards as it relates to product offerings and our willingness and ability to start penetrating other markets -- \nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: And I would just add to that that with regard to credit outside the United States, that we did have a solid growth rate for the March ending quarter and we expect to have positive growth in credit outside the United States all on a constant dollar basis in the quarter ending in June as well. \nDan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: And then just lastly and then I\u2019ll be done -- on the incentive fees, around the time of the IPO you had always said that that was a number that actually should trend up because it was primarily a U.S. phenomenon and using that to get contracts and as you went internationally, you were going to start to use is.  But what I\u2019m hearing from you guys today is that that is abating a bit, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a change of tone to using incentive fees as you go abroad?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: As we put more clients under multi-year contracts, which is a strategy that we support, with contracts comes an agreement to offer incentive, and so it is a continuing strategy of ours over time to have more clients under multi-year contract and therefore there would be more client revenue that would be subject to incentives. That strategy was articulated at the time of the IPO and it is still a strategy that we are pursuing today. \nDan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with UBS Securities.\nJason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities: Thanks. I wanted to start with a clarification on the quarter itself -- the $0.67 pro forma EPS number, what tax rate was behind that? Was that a normalized tax rate or -- I think the GAAP tax rate was more in the 43%-ish range related to the gain on sale. Can you clarify that?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: Yes, the $0.67 was at a more normalized tax rate because the boost in our tax rate for the quarter was due to the Visa Net Brazil transaction because of some capital gains taxes and the tax environment specific to Brazil, we ended up experiencing about 4 percentage points higher tax rate in the quarter. When you back that out -- so to go from $0.98 on an adjusted basis down to $0.67, when you remove that transaction, you would then go to the more normalized tax rate, which was trending at about 39.5. \nJason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities: Okay, and that was the basis for the $0.67?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: Yes. \nJason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just to pick up on an earlier question as far as confidence and visibility on the low-end of the 11% to 15% net revenue growth range for next year, you talked about the currency and gas components of that. Obviously the two other underlying assumptions you\u2019ve discussed for a while are the broader U.S. economy and cross-border. It seems like those numbers are kind of stable, bouncing around a little bit. Can you just talk about your relative level of comfort with those two variables and how important they might be versus the other two variables in terms of actually getting yourself into this 11% to 12% range or so for next year?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, I think the specific words that I used in the script were we would start to see some movement, so we don\u2019t expect any significant positive movement in either of the economy or cross border transactions, although we do expect them to stabilize and start to move up very modestly. And as long as that happens in the first quarter, early second quarter, I\u2019m quite confident we will get to where we are going. \nJason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities: Okay, so we don\u2019t really need to see this \u201cpositive inflection point\u201d anytime real soon to still get you into this range, it sounds like?\nJoseph W. Saunders: No, it doesn\u2019t have to happen [inaudible]. \nJason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities: Okay, great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Kissane with Banc of America.\nJames Kissane - Banc of America Securities: Great, thanks. Byron, what portion of the incentives in the quarter were more one-time and what portion is recurring? And maybe on a more normal basis, what portion will be one-time and what portion is recurring?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: Jim, as you can appreciate, we don\u2019t discuss that level of granularity on the incentive. We\u2019ve tried to be helpful here by saying it was somewhat elevated given the unusual high level of contract activity that was successfully completed in the quarter and we will look forward to giving more guidance around the incentive levels when we finish up the fourth quarter and we give you an outlook for -- a more informed outlook for fiscal year \u201910. \nJames Kissane - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Any change in the average term of the contracts on the renewals?\nByron H. Pollitt Jr.: I would say at the time of the IPO, I would say the most difficult contract length was five years. I would say we are starting to see some increasing interest going a bit beyond five. To say that it\u2019s actually moved the average might be too strong a term but we are seeing some contracts now that -- substantive contracts that are going beyond five years. \nJames Kissane - Banc of America Securities: Okay, great. Thanks, Byron. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi, Wells Fargo.\nTim Willi - Wells Fargo: Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering, a question about U.S. debit -- if I look at the last six to seven quarters, sort of boiling it down to the spend and transactions per card, you know, I think the conventional wisdom would have been that as the economy suffered, people would switch spending habits from credit to debit and looking at sort of year-over-year growth in transactions per card, even dollars per card spent, it doesn\u2019t look like that has occurred.  So I\u2019m wondering if there is something regarding inactive or just newer debit cards on the U.S. platform that have not quite matured in terms of the user getting more comfortable with them, and as well if you could talk about any kind of strategies or discussions with your banking partners in the U.S. about trying to drive higher utilization on debit in the face of what you\u2019ve articulated about credit, that it\u2019s essentially probably going nowhere in the U.S. \nJoseph W. Saunders: Wow, that\u2019s a loaded question. Let me start with the back-end of that. First of all, we are working to drive debit [both with our clients and that is the entire basis of our media campaign in the United States this year]. I mean, everything that we are doing in the media is debit centric and is predicated on using debit cards.  I would say that you are going to see debit cards be a very, very good story going forward. I think you will see the number of transactions that people use their cards for going up. I think that we continue to see more cards being put into the market and all the right things are happening on the debit front.  And I want to say one other thing -- I didn\u2019t say the credit card market in the United States was [inaudible]. I didn\u2019t say that. I said that we were not anticipating that we were going to get much velocity from the credit card market in the next 12 months. I think that as a result of the Credit Card Act and some of the issues that financial institutions have with the loan quality of their portfolio, that it would just be na\u00efve to think that there wouldn\u2019t be some reflection as it related to that product and how it was going to be issued and how it was going to be used, but I certainly don\u2019t believe, and unless any of my clients are telling me differently, that the credit card is dead. \nTim Willi - Wells Fargo: Okay, and I appreciate that. Just to follow-up on that debit question then, do you think it\u2019s a matter of just more consumer awareness or are there key verticals and other areas of spend in the U.S. where there just needs to be more merchant acceptance to get that spend up on debit, or is this really just more and more advertising and the banks getting to those consumers more effectively that use this card as much as you can?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, I guess I would have to look at the exact number you are looking at because when I look at the numbers, the transaction -- our transaction volume is up 9% in the last quarter. It is mostly coming from the debit sector.  We have three times as many debit transactions as credit card transactions and have for a little while now, and for the first time in the history of Visa, last quarter the dollar volume of debit card transactions exceeded that of credit card transactions.  So my view into this product is a pretty positive view and I expect that to continue. I think you might want to pick this question up with Jack Carsky because I am just -- you kind of caught me a little bit off-balance here because I\u2019m not sure we are talking the same language. \nTim Willi - Wells Fargo: Okay. I appreciate that, we\u2019ll do that, thanks. \nJack Carsky: At this point, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: The last question comes from Donald Fendetti with Citigroup.\nDonald Fendetti \u2013 Citigroup: Clearly the U.S. seems to have stabilized in terms of credit but it looks like the international growth rates are still positive but moderating. I was just curious sort of what your view is on the insight on the non-U.S. consumer -- are we pretty close to where you think those growth rates will start stabilizing?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, that\u2019s a little bit difficult to call. The fact of the matter is there have been issues, economic issues all over the world and the fact that the international credit card volume is growing has as much to do with the secular shift from cash and checks to plastic as it does with a consumer\u2019s use of credit as you might think about it in the United States.  So I think that this has a while. I think that this has a while to play out and I think that we are continuing to get traction in different parts of the world and I think that -- you know, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to stop so I think we\u2019ll have a pretty positive story as time goes on. And I guess the best I can do is -- to end all of this is to tell you that we are cautiously optimistic that things are getting somewhat better, not somewhat worse. \nDonald Fendetti \u2013 Citigroup: Okay, thanks. \nJack Carsky: Thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to either call myself or Victoria. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. To begin with I am very pleased to report that our fiscal second quarter results were consistent with the guidance and expectations we provided in our last quarter\u2019s earnings call. Despite the challenging global economy, Visa delivered strong operational and financial performance benefiting from its diverse product set, our intense focus on expense management and the underlying worldwide secular shift from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment which continues unabated.  Our operating net revenues in the second quarter were over $1.6 billion, an increase over 13% over the year-ago period and right in line with our guidance this quarter. Our adjusted operating margin of 55% which benefited from our ongoing efficiency drive was solid as well and exceeded our stated full-year guidance of the mid to high 40% range.  Finally, adjusted second quarter net income of $553 million was 38% greater than the year-ago period. Looking forward from a macro standpoint the world economy continues to slow and while Visa is resilient it is not immune. Aggregate payment volume growth in our international regions in the December quarter were a positive mid double digit rate and preliminary volume trends through March suggest only a modest decline since then.  This of course will be reflected in our fiscal third quarter service revenues.  There continues to be regional bright spots around the globe where the trends are holding up even more substantially. In the U.S. specifically, payment growth declined to approximately a 1% negative rate to the December quarter and we saw little change through the March quarter. We are encouraged that in aggregate over the five month period through April we have seen some stabilization in U.S. payment volumes.  Of course the more than 30% rate of decline in the year-over-year price of gasoline has resulted in difficult year-over-year comparables which will continue for the next few months before finally abating as we move into fiscal 2010. Importantly, all of the results we have achieved today are in spite of foreign currency headwinds which we also expect to abate by the beginning of fiscal 2010.  The underlying resilience of our business was evident from the contribution of debit credits in the U.S. which Visa pioneered in the mid 1990\u2019s. Debit in the U.S. posted growth in each month of the March quarter as well as through the month of April. The continued strength of debt is attributable in part to that product\u2019s strong correlation with non-discretionary spending categories which are holding up relatively well in the face of a tough economy.  In fact, in the quarter ended in December for the first time in Visa\u2019s history the U.S. debit payment volumes eclipsed that of credit, an important milestone in the history of our business and a testament to the diversity of our product. Process transaction growth was resilient as well, posting gains of 6% through the end of March with even better performance through this point in the month of April.  Before touching on our near term outlook let me underscore several important things that I think you should take away from this call.  Our financial performance in fiscal 2009 is holding consistent with our expectations and guidance and reflects appropriate funding of all of our growth initiatives. Our business model has proven resilient in the face of today\u2019s economic challenges. Transaction growth led by debit has continued unabated in part driven by the secular shift from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment. This global shift in spending behavior is also being driven by Visa whose product innovation, expansion of payment categories and focused global advertising that moves consumers to want to transact at point of sale with Visa products.  With the global economy having some impact on revenue growth, Visa\u2019s management team remains focused on delivering margins and adjusted earnings per share growth outlined during our IPO road show. We have therefore accelerated merger related cost efficiencies which have fully offset the shortfalls in revenue growth.  In the near-term the continuing challenge in cross-border payment volumes, foreign exchange and gas price headwinds and lapping price increases will have a negative effect on the back half of our fiscal year. For this reason, we still expect low single digit revenue growth in our fiscal third quarter although the fourth quarter should now be higher based on several factors including planned strategic pricing actions recently announced. With this in mind we are confident in achieving the high single digit revenue range for all of fiscal 2009.  With the anticipated contribution from expense savings we are on target to meet our 2009 diluted earnings per share growth guidance of greater than 20%. Given the fiscal year-to-date results and our adjusted operating margin we are taking the full year 2009 guidance up modestly from currently mid to high 40\u2019s range to the low 50\u2019s range. Additionally, we are taking 2010 adjusted operating margins to the high 40\u2019s to low 50% range. Byron will touch on this further in a moment.  Looking ahead to fiscal 2010 we are not changing the outlook we shared with you last quarter. We continue to be cautiously optimistic we can regain our 11-15% revenue growth target assuming some recovery in the U.S. economy and cross-border volumes by early 2010 and we expect more favorable year-over-year comparison on gas prices and foreign exchange rates. We expect to achieve or earnings per share and adjusted operating margin targets even if revenue growth is somewhat below our guidance range.  Finally, we continue to focus on fine service given the historic times in the banking sector and the broader economy. Consolidations in the banking industry may continue and Visa expects to be the beneficiary of this activity. We will do so by remaining committed to providing our clients with products and programs that move their businesses forward and add value to their customers.  Debit and our prepaid platform as well a money transfer and new technologies for payment at the point of sale will continue to differentiate Visa from the rest of the payments industry.  With that let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the financial results and our current thinking on the financial guidance. \nByron Pollitt :  Thank you Joe. As is now our custom let me begin with the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and then I will touch on trends we are seeing for the quarter ending in March as well as some early results for April.  As Joe mentioned it was a solid fiscal second quarter with strong revenue and earnings growth remembering that service revenues which represent 41% of our gross revenue are reported on a one-quarter lag. Total payment volume growth for Visa, Inc. through the end of December 2008 in nominal dollars was a negative 1% falling to $675 billion over the same quarter in 2007. In the U.S. debit delivered a solid 6% growth while credit was a negative 7%. In the December quarter for the first time in our history U.S. debit payment volume eclipsed that of credit volume although credit still remains the payment vehicle of choice internationally.  On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% moderating from the 22% growth exhibited in the September quarter but still solidly positive, a further recognition of the secular resiliency of plastic in many emerging and developing economies. As a reminder, cross-border volume growth in the December ending quarter slowed to zero on a constant dollar basis, down from low double digits in the prior period. The slow down was broad based. Through the end of March it continued its decline and ended the period at a negative 6% constant dollar growth rate.  Excluding Visa Europe, globally total cards outstanding for the period ending December grew 8% with just over 1.7 billion cards carrying the Visa brand. Credit cards grew 2% to 813 million cards while debit rose 14% to 905 million cards. Debit card growth, primarily in the United States was positively affected by prepaid gift card programs that are obviously very popular around the December holidays.  International card growth of 13% remains very healthy as well. Overall credit card growth in the U.S. has slowed as the result of re-trenchment in credit card marketing programs but this slow down is being more than offset by gains internationally.  Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network which are reported on a real-time basis totaled $9.4 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 6% over the similar period a year ago. It is important to reiterate a point we made last quarter and Joe touched on earlier. While payment volume and average ticket sizes have continued to moderate, our processed transactions which represent approximately 28% of our gross revenue continue to post solid growth as the underlying secular shift to electronic payments and more precisely to Visa continues.  Turning to the income statement, in the second quarter gross revenues of $1.9 billion were up 8% from the similar period in 2008. Volume and support incentives decreased by $43 million to $295 million representing 15% of gross revenue, in line with our full-year expectation with a range of 14-16% of gross revenue. As you know, volume and support incentives are recognized based on current quarter results.  The year-over-year decline was the result of lower 2009 fiscal second quarter payment volume growth as well as the effect of a one-time $70 million non-recurring charge in last year\u2019s quarter partially offset by new contractual adjustments in the current quarter. Net operating revenues were just over $1.6 billion, a 13% increase over the operating revenues reported for the second fiscal quarter 2008 and right in line with the guidance we gave last quarter.  Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $804 million, up 2% over the prior year period and reflective of moderating year-over-year payment volumes in all regions for the quarter ending December 31. Data processing revenue, reported on a current quarter basis was $544 million, up 10% over the prior year as processed transaction growth remains solid. International transaction revenue, also reported on a current quarter basis, were up 18% to $446 million as moderating cross-border volumes in the period were offset by competitive pricing modifications enacted during the fiscal third quarter of 2008.  Our adjusted operating margin was approximately 55%, above our stated mid to high 40% guidance as Joe mentioned. The increase in margin was due to lower volume and support incentives which are recognized in the current quarter as well as certain expenses shifting from our second fiscal quarter into the back half of the year. I will provide additional color on our future margin expectations in a moment.  On an adjusted basis, operating expenses for the second quarter declined $38 million or 5% year-over-year driven by lower costs across the board with the exception of network and EDT. Our focus one expense reduction is broad-based and is driven by merger related efficiencies. All of our long-term product investments are being prudently funded. While some expenses will increase in the back half of the year such as marketing, these are anticipated and are fully consistent with our guidance.  Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter, approximately $33 million of which were dedicated to the build out of our new data center. The center was partially brought on line in March and will be fully operational by the end of our fiscal fourth quarter. We anticipate the associated depreciation and amortization costs in the second half of the year to be about $12 million.  Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter in excellent shape with very little debt and cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $5.8 billion. Of this total, $2.1 billion is restricted cash which represents amounts sufficient to fully pay out the American Express and Discover settlements.  We also recently announced our intent to unlock up to 30% of the outstanding Class C shareholdings which will help alleviate some of the share overhang as we approach the ultimate unlock date of March 25, 2011. Conversion and sale of these shares will increase our public float but will have no dilutive impact on our shares outstanding. As mentioned in our press release we are filing a shelf registration that will allow us the flexibility to quickly access the capital markets with either equity or debt instruments. The proceeds of any future transaction could be used for a variety of reasons but at this point in time we have no plans or reasons to go to market. This action is nothing more than proactive capital structure planning.  Now let me comment on the trends we are seeing that will impact our results in the coming quarter and fiscal 2009. As we said last quarter we expect the back half of 2009 to be more challenging from a revenue standpoint and this continues to be our view. Specifically here in the U.S., payment volume growth has declined from a negative 1% growth rate in the December quarter to a negative 2% growth in the March quarter. Deconstructing this further, credit volume growth ended the period at a negative 10% while debit volume growth continued in positive territory posting a 5% gain.  More recently through the 28th of April aggregate U.S. payment volume growth has trended back to a negative 1% growth rate. Credit growth continues at a negative 10% while debit growth has regained some momentum rising from a positive 5% in the March period to a positive 7% April month to date.  Regardless of the potential impact of an Easter shift, these growth trends are encouraging and consistent with performance we have seen over the past four months. As further perspective, certain categories of spend like gasoline, airlines and lodging continue to be challenged especially as they relate to credit volumes. On the other hand, recurring bill pay, quick serving restaurants, healthcare and super markets continue to grow very nicely. These categories tend to favor debit over credit, even more so in this environment which is the foundation of some of the resilience of that product.  On balance, as Joe mentioned earlier, over the past several months we are seeing in aggregate some stabilization in the U.S. payment volume growth trends. Having said that we do not know for certain whether we are seeing an inflection point. Outside the U.S. for the quarter ending March 2009 we expect constant dollar payment volume growth rates to be solidly positive but to decline modestly from their levels at the end of December.  As mentioned earlier, cross-border volumes in constant volumes were flat in the December ending quarter and in the March ending quarter have declined to negative mid single digits. Month to date in April we have seen similar results. Processed transaction growth ended the March period at 6% while month to date in April has reached 9% also a testament to the strength and resilience of debit as a greater percentage of processed transactions are debit based.  Now let me comment on what we see over the coming year as far as our operating performance is concerned and how it may affect our current guidance.  Based on our second quarter results and our improved balance of year outlook we are confident about delivering net revenue growth in the high single digits and as Joe said we continue to expect revenue growth in the third quarter in the low single digits while the fourth is projected to be modestly higher. Also as a reminder, this second half outlook encompasses a more pronounced negative foreign exchange impact which on a year-over-year basis is now expected to reduce revenue growth by about 4 percentage points in each quarter.  Given the strong adjusted operating margin exhibited this quarter we are adjusting up our 2009 guidance to the low 50% range. For 2010 recognizing the general uncertainty around the economy, our attention to continuing investing for future growth and the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expenses we are moving our guidance from mid to high 40\u2019s to the high 40\u2019s low 50\u2019s range.  Most importantly, and to reiterate Joe\u2019s statement, we remain on track to deliver our guidance of annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of greater than 20% for 2009.  Looking to 2010 given the scenario that includes some recovery in the U.S. economy and in cross-border travel, combined with more favorable comparisons in gas prices and foreign exchange rates we would expect to exceed 20% earnings per share growth.  That concludes my comments so I will turn the call back over to Joe. \nJoseph Saunders :  Let me conclude by saying that while the economy continues to present challenges, Visa remains in a strong position to weather the storm and more importantly realize operating advantages when the economy does finally turn around. We have and continue to lay the ground work for an effective and efficient expense structure, we are making the proper investments in products and processes to drive incremental growth in the future and most importantly we continue to work with our clients to provide them the best possible credit and debit products and processing solutions to meet their business needs.  Over the longer term, the success of these initiatives will be recognized in the strength of our relationships with our clients and the growth of our business with each of them wherever they are located around the world.  Thank you all. Of course thanks Jack for introducing me. With that we will take any questions.  \n :\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities. \nJason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities: I wanted to start with a question on the margins. Obviously nice to see the raise in the outlook there. I guess it begs the question of thinking sort of longer term beyond 2010, how high can the margins in this business theoretically go understanding that obviously the business scales very well, you have accomplished some very significant structural cost take out which should be even more beneficial when volumes reaccelerate but at the same time people shouldn\u2019t expect huge pricing power to prevail indefinitely and you are continuing to invest in the long-term growth of the business. How should investors think about the longer term margin potential of this business in your opinion? \nJoseph Saunders :  I don\u2019t think we are ready to predict that at this particular point in time. I think that in the current situation in the current environment and the current economy there are things that we probably are doing somewhat less aggressively because they simply aren\u2019t things that would gain traction right now. It certainly doesn\u2019t make sense to over-advertise in an environment where there is going to be less credit usage for instance, as an example. There is a lot of other things. I think we have to carefully consider that but we are obviously focused on expense control and efficiency and we will never stop focusing on that in the future. So we will see. \nJason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities: How are you guys thinking about the broad impact on the card industry potentially if some of the currently proposed legislation on non-interchange ends up becoming law especially if this ends up including some of the more restrictive elements that potentially go beyond the Fed\u2019s UDAP regulations that were approved in late 2008? Is some of that factoring into your thinking as you are outlining the top line outlook for us into fiscal 2010? \nJoseph Saunders :  Anything that affects our clients ultimately affects us. We are as concerned as they are that whatever transpires is done thoughtfully and in collaboration. We think that we do not believe that what is happening and what will happen will mark the end of the credit or debit card business in the United States and reasonably certain that we will continue to see increasing volumes as the economy recovers. But these are troublesome times and there are many issues out there and while we are not directly affected by UDAP or some of the proposed regulations and bills that are attached to it or some of the opinions that our President has, we are concerned and ultimately impacted. So we are going to keep our eye on that and as I said try to help make sure it gets thoughtfully enacted. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Julio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nJulio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Can I start with you real quick just on trying to reconcile the commentary for cross-border volumes in the March quarter relative to the revenue growth you posted there. I think it was roughly 18%. I think you said it was flat but revenue growth was 18%. Is the delta between that zero and 18% purely pricing and some of the adjustments you are making there? \nJoseph Saunders :  That\u2019s right. We are annualizing out, this will be the last quarter of annualizing price adjustments that we are taking in the third fiscal quarter of 2008. So you are seeing the last impacts of that annualization. \nJulio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.: There was another price commentary you made that would have kicked in April as well? \nJoseph Saunders :  April of? \nJulio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.:  2009 I guess. \nJoseph Saunders :  Not international. No. \nJulio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I\u2019m sorry on North America. Excuse me. \nJoseph Saunders :  I\u2019m not familiar with what you are referring to. The last substantive adjustment we made that would have been impacting this quarter would have been the international adjustment third quarter fiscal year 2008. \nJulio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Nothing else you are expecting going forward in fiscal 2009 at this point? \nJoseph Saunders :  Say that last part again? \nJulio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.: You are not expecting anything else from the international side or domestically going forward? \nJoseph Saunders :  That is correct. As you move into the current quarter you should expect that the impact of that annualization to be felt or the absence thereof. \nOperator:  The next question comes from James Kissane - Banc of America Securities. \nJames Kissane - Banc of America Securities: Just following up on that question, in the release you talked about right sizing the pricing structure. Can you put a little more color around that? \nJoseph Saunders :  I think that we have said that from the beginning in the road show and our guidance we have always suggested a modest amount of growth for the time being is going to come from pricing changes and indeed it has. Indeed I think it will although I think on a somewhat reduced basis. As Byron just said there are no pricing changes that we made in the third quarter that are going to impact our earnings as I said there are some modest adjustments that were made that will affect us and have a positive effect in the fourth quarter. \nJames Kissane - Banc of America Securities: Is that like 1-2%? Can you put a range around it? \nJoseph Saunders :  It is a little too soon to call. \nJames Kissane - Banc of America Securities: You also touched on consolidation. Any update on timing of contract renegotiations as a result of the consolidations like Chase and Wamu?\nJoseph Saunders :  I would certainly like to give you some definitive information and you can rest assured that I will as soon as I can. \nJames Kissane - Banc of America Securities: Is it a 2009 event? \nJoseph Saunders :  We will let you know as soon as we can. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities: I wanted to as you if you could discuss what your planning looks like or your thought process looks like around if the current swine flu was to expand to SARS-like proportions. \nJoseph Saunders :  Well we have looked at that obviously and we at this exact point in time based on what we know right now and of course this is something that is unfolding but as we look at it and we look at SARS this would not cause us to back off of the guidance we just gave you. We would still be looking for high single digit revenue growth for the year. Obviously if something happened it might be a little bit less than if it doesn\u2019t but nevertheless we are talking the same range.  One thing that you should keep in mind and everybody should keep in mind, when SARS occurred the cross-border volume was pretty robust and growing pretty rapidly and then it subsided from that. There was only one really bad quarter during the SARS epidemic and then it was totally back within four quarters and actually after the one bad quarter it went back up about 50%. Now nothing says this is going to be the same kind of activity but the other very important thing to remember is a considerable number of people as we have continued to remind everybody in our quarterly reports have already stopped traveling. You don\u2019t have the same base of leisure travel that is going on today as there was when SARS occurred. They didn\u2019t need the flu epidemic to stay off the airplanes. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities: So that is purely from an economic pressure point of view that people have stopped traveling. \nJoseph Saunders :  Obviously they have. Our cross-border volume has gone down. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities: Another question on cross-border. Would you be able to tell me around what percentage of cross-border transactions occur in the United States from people outside the U.S. versus the other way around? \nByron Pollitt:  We haven\u2019t commented on that level of break down. We were prepared to be a little more specific around Mexico if that question was targeted but we haven\u2019t made a decision yet to regularly disclose that level of detail. We will take that under advisement though and consider that going forward. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities: So how are you doing in Mexico? \nByron Pollitt :  If we were to isolate Mexico the impact on revenue or the contribution to revenue as it relates to cross-border travel is less than 1%. That is primarily reflected in the international fees. Even if it turned out to be a significant impact on cross-border related to Mexico as Joe mentioned earlier we are still very comfortable reaffirming the high single digit revenue guidance for the year. \nJoseph Saunders :  When Byron says less than 1% he is saying about 1% of gross revenues. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the March/April trends. It was nice to hear the stabilization in the U.S. did better than what we expected. Can you detail again what you are seeing outside the U.S. in terms of more recent trends? Maybe more detail across the four international regions? Some flavor? \nJoseph Saunders :  With regard to payment volume trends which I think you are referring to, remember that we report them on a one quarter lag. We don\u2019t have that complete data yet. What we did say was that with regards to payment volume growth on a constant dollar basis, rest of world in the December ending quarter which was the basis for our service revenue in the current quarter grew at 14% and we would expect preliminary results suggest that the payment volume growth rest of world in constant dollars will remain solidly profitable but at a modestly lower level than what we experienced in the prior quarters.  \nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: [discuss] some of the preliminary discussions with some of the international banks. You can come to that conclusion right? \nJoseph Saunders :  Yes. \nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: The process transactions, Byron, glad to hear that up 9% I believe in the April month. Can you break that out as well for us between the U.S. and rest of world if possible or is that not available? \nByron Pollitt :  What I can give you, first of all the 9% was month to date through the 28th for April. We only have that for the moment at an ink level but if we were to go back to the prior quarter for the March ending quarter growth rates were mid single digits for both the U.S. and rest of world. \nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: Last a housekeeping question. Just this accelerated Class C release program, can you give us some detail on how that might get executed? \nByron Pollitt :  Recall that each Class C share represents a one for one conversion ratio into our publicly traded A shares. Today we have 151 million of C shares or A share equivalents all of which are locked up. That represents about 20% of our outstanding shares. All of those shares today unlock on March 25, 2011 which was not a situation that we wanted to allow to happen. Therefore, proactively we wanted to begin unlocking those shares early to release some of the pressure that otherwise would have occurred in 2011. 30% or roughly 45 million C shares have the opportunity to unlock between July 1 of this year through September 30. When we say unlock that means that the banks that own them have the opportunity to sell them. It doesn\u2019t mean they will sell them. It means they have the opportunity to sell them. So we will be ready by July 1 to make a request from our member banks, our non-U.S. banks, all C shareholders are non-U.S. banks. We will be prepared to process requests for them to unlock shares and make them available for sale.  Once a C share sells it automatically becomes an A share and is added to our float. As a further matter of perspective we currently trade about 9.5 million shares a day. So 30% of the 151 million is roughly 45 million shares or about five days worth of trading. So we would expect that the unlock would occur during the course of that window, July 1 to September 30, with very little disruption to our trading volume or price.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: So you will get the description level and that will probably dribble out so there is not necessarily a secondary there or direct share purchase program at this stage. \nByron Pollitt:  That is exactly right. We expect requests to come in during the course of the window. We will unlock promptly so there would be no secondary or any one day or several days that we would expect to have significant transactions. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Donald Fendetti \u2013 Citigroup. \nDonald Fendetti \u2013 Citigroup: I was wondering if you could provide an update on the regulatory environment in the U.S. and outside if there are any hot spots. I know there was a little bit of talk about interchange on the pending TARP bill but it looks very unlikely. If you could provide some color that would be great. \nJoseph Saunders :  I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m in the business of predicting what Congress will do in this environment but we feel quite good about any interchange legislation not being in UDAP for loaning or [Welsh] or any other bill for the time being. We seem to be making some progress, although I do not have an official announcement for you, in Australia. Maybe New Zealand. There has been some things that are going on in Europe which don\u2019t directly affect us. I think generally we are in pretty good shape other than the comments I made earlier about UDAP and how it affects us. \nOperator: The next question comes from Christopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Can you talk about your guidance for fiscal 2010? I think it includes a re-acceleration of revenue growth but yet the operating margin guidance includes the high 40\u2019s. Why would the operating margin fall back into the 40\u2019s on that forecast in your mind? \nJoseph Saunders :  We said the high 40\u2019s to low 50\u2019s. Under the current circumstance you can tell we are running in the low to mid 50\u2019s and before doing all of our formal planning or anything we are saying it will likely be in that neighborhood next year. \nByron Pollitt :  I would just reiterate something Joe said earlier which is this is an unusually difficult time for many of our clients. There has been re-trenching in card marketing programs. There is a more limited expectation that were we to invest in growth initiatives there would be the same level of traction today as there would be if the environment were more favorable. So we are just being cautious about expressing margin expectations, recognizing there is a lot of growth runway with this company and with this industry and once the economy improves we want to be positioned to take advantage of it. \nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: As a follow-up Byron, are you talking about helping your customers does that mean increased incentives and rebates? Increased marketing spend? Both? Are we at a depressed level right now? Will this rebound in 2010? \nByron Pollitt :  Good question. As the autonomy improves as payment volume growth improves for our clients we would expect the way our incent formulas work we would pay out more incentives because more would be earned and we would be thrilled to do so by the way. With regard to marketing that was something Joe specifically called out as an example of an expense that were the environment more favorable and we believe that there would be more traction and response to marketing we would be fully prepared to accelerate our ability to grow payment volumes and revenues. \nJoseph Saunders :  The short answer is I think not necessarily to expect operating margins to go over there now at any time in the near future. \nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: A separate question, is the C class release and the subsequent increase in flow give you additional capacity to do share purchase and any thoughts on excess capital or what your plans are to do with it? \nByron Pollitt :  The answer is yes to the first question. When a C share converts it becomes an A. What that means as an A share it is not owned by any of our member banks. Therefore, the amount of float that would be available for us to repurchase and keep public ownership above 50% would increase. So the answer to your first question is absolutely yes. With regard to the second question, we have continually reaffirmed our intent to use excess cash to pay dividends and to repurchase shares under a strong belief that excess cash should be returned to shareholders. So we remain very committed to that principle. \nOperator:  The next question comes from John Williams \u2013 Macquarie. \nJohn Williams \u2013 Macquarie: I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on what you are seeing from your bank customers in terms of their appetite for things like debit products and prepaid and money transfer particularly when you look at advanced credit type products in this environment? \nJoseph Saunders :  I think that I\u2019m not sure it is an appetite issue with our clients. I think it is a function of the economy and what people are willing to do and what they are capable of doing and how the banks assess that, how financial institutions assess their capabilities so in other words how much credit are they going to give anybody in this particular environment. So, as we said, we are getting a lot more traction off of our debit volume and our debit transactions both in dollars and in numbers of transactions. I would expect that to continue in the moderate run. I don\u2019t think that the credit card business is going to go away but I think we are operating in some relatively troubled times.  I think that our clients are pretty smart about their businesses. I think they know what they are doing and I think they will promote those things they think will resonate at a particular point in time and we are going to have to wait and see what happens in the economy before I can accurately or totally predict exactly what they are going to do. \nJohn Williams \u2013 Macquarie: How about on money transfer? Is there any specific commentary you can offer? \nJoseph Saunders :  I don\u2019t have anything specific to say about it but we have talked about it as one of our initiatives. We have not abandoned that notion at all. We did make an announcement I believe last quarter about an arrangement we have with MoneyGram where people can transfer money between Visa accounts at any MoneyGram location. That is not the end of what we are going to do. It is barely the beginning and we will bring you up to date on it when we have firmer and more specific news. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. \nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods: I guess I was hoping you could help me with the two larger expense lines a little bit more. I guess on marketing could you help us think about how much discretion you have to pull if needed on that line and some of the deflationary pressures you are seeing in that market? Then on the personnel line could you just talk about kind of where we are as far as headcount rationalization is concerned and how we should think about that line going forward? \nJoseph Saunders :  I\u2019ll talk about the marketing and I will let Byron talk about the people. As far as the marketing goes, we have an ROI model. We pay attention to the return that we get. We are focusing all of our advertising and all of our marketing expense right now on increasing usage so we are trying to keep that transfer of attitude from cash and checks to plastic alive and we keep it alive with our advertising. If you look at our new Go campaign in the United States it is totally debit card focused. It is totally talking about using a debit card to buy a pizza, to go to the aquarium, to get a song on your iPod and any one of a number of things instead of using a check or instead of using cash. So we measure the effectiveness of that. We will continue to spend the amount of money we feel is appropriate as it relates to helping us increase the volume and therefore increase our revenue and I think we have done a pretty good job of being disciplined.  Of course we can ratchet back on the category for a period of time without getting substantially harmed. We will do what is appropriate to do in the environment we are in so that we can continue to deliver what we promised we would deliver. \nByron Pollitt : On the personnel side if we were to elevate for a moment and take you back to our road show commitment we had a commitment to reduce $300 million of costs associated with the merging of the six businesses that currently comprise Visa, Inc. that took place in October 2007. What we have said, and rationalizing personnel costs were an important component of that, we would expect that to be largely complete, the merger related synergies by the end of this year and at that point as you can appreciate with a company that is now continuing to assimilate six different companies we have opportunity to re-engineer our processes so they are less regional based and more global based reflective we are now operating as a global enterprise. So the productivity improvement opportunities that are always present with every company become more of a routine opportunity for us also translates that it is heavier sledding to get those because you are re-engineering processes, you are standardizing a systems platform so it takes some investment often to get those gains.  As Joe said we are a business that is maniacally focused on delivering expense improvement as a part of our value proposition and we will continue that focus unrelenting. \nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods: One quick follow-up, in the guidance you talk about certain economic recovery functions. What exactly are those? Are you expecting like a decelerating rate of deterioration or are there any specific data points you guys are talking to? \nJoseph Saunders :  What we said were four things. First that in early fiscal year 2010 there would be some recovery in U.S. payment volume or the U.S. economy and cross-border travel. Recovery means that we are starting to see some year-over-year growth. Recovery is not a lower decelerating. Recovery is some year-over-year growth. We know that in the first fiscal quarter, the quarter beginning in October we know that was the quarter where gas prices took a significant reduction from where the had been through most of 2008 and we also know that during that quarter is when the U.S. dollar strengthened considerably against an array of currencies. So once we get into that October/November time frame we are now lapping those two situations. So from that standpoint we feel pretty confident those two will happen. What it really depends on is some recovery in U.S. payment volumes and in cross-border travel. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray. \nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: There were some discussions I guess reported in some newspapers I guess that Visa was looking at an acquisition of a processing division of a large bank here in Ohio not too long ago. I just wondered what your thoughts are on acquisitions in the U.S. or internationally in the processing market and the merchant acquiring side of that business or otherwise.\nJoseph Saunders :  That is a good question. There was something in the paper and it was about a processing operation in Ohio and we obviously didn\u2019t do it and decided we didn\u2019t want to do it. We also purchased, as you know, YCS which is a processing system that we use outside of the United States. It is multi-currency and multi-lingual and it is easier to deploy than the Visa Net would be and so we made that transaction. We are looking at other transactions that would put us at the center of the payments business in other regions around the world, particularly emerging regions. It is not clear to me there is anything in the offing tomorrow or the next day but we are alert to what is going on and we are paying attention to it and we will make moves that we think are strategically appropriate. \nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: You are talking about merchant acquiring businesses and related? \nJoseph Saunders :  In the end we are not a merchant acquirer. We own 10% of an acquiring business in Brazil which people have talked about potentially being IPO\u2019d. We own small practicing entities in several other Latin American countries. We may participate in an acquiring business in an emerging economy but if we did it would essentially be to speed up the terminalization of that region and we would not ultimately desire to be in the acquiring business. But it may or not may be necessary to get something going. \nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: On the percentage, do you know what percentage of your credit card payment volume is on cards that do not revolve? No borrowing. Approximately? \nByron Pollitt:  I think the way we have tried to approach that is if you take, we can answer it from the U.S. perspective. If you take our total U.S. consumer payment volume, recognizing that a little over 50% is now on debit which by definition doesn\u2019t revolve and then you add into that those credit card accounts where during the course of the year less than half the credit line renews and you add those two together we have a little over 90-95% of our U.S. consumer payment volume would fit that definition. We view saying that less than half the credit line is used throughout the year is basically saying that is an account that generally doesn\u2019t revolve for most of the year. \nOperator:  The final question comes from Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets. \nDan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: With this corresponding shelf registration and I understand you are kind of saying it is just good capital management but I am just wondering can you give us an update on this Visa put. I suspect you would want to issue some debt for whatever reason you would want to handle that. \nJoseph Saunders:  On the put there is no update. We have no reason whatsoever to believe that Visa Europe is interested in the put. Were they to put we would of course look at that as a possible source of financing but that has absolutely nothing to do with the shelf registration. As we were approaching the December time period for replenishing our escrow account we decided in the end to do a direct purchase of the shares, the permission for which was required by our shareholders in the event that permission which required a super majority voting provision was not given we had a back up course of action to do a follow-on underwriting. We prepared for that in parallel. With what we found since we had the favorable vote to do it directly in December we had basically done all the work for a shelf registration and therefore decided to go ahead and file it. \nDan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Does the new data center provide you any near-term opportunity to lower your unit costs and is there a corresponding data center that is closing as a result? I forget how that is. \nJoseph Saunders :  The answer is yes to both questions. So this replaces an existing data center and with that replacement it brings in a significant capacity increase to our existing network and leveraging that capacity increase will allow us to bring down per transaction charges. \nDan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Is that part of the embedded numbers thinking about 2010 or is that part of the embedded number as we think about back of 2009? \nJoseph Saunders :  2010 and beyond. \nDan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Would you be willing to keep incent fees moderately higher than what the volume would suggest to take opportunities to get some greater market share? \nByron Pollitt :  We deal with each of our clients on a basis that advantages both the client and Visa. That is about all I\u2026\nDan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Care to say about that. Understood. \nJack Carsky:  Thank you all very much.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I\u2019ll turn over the call to Joe.\nJoseph W. Saunders: I\u2019m pleased to report that in spite of the ongoing challenges with the economy we began our fiscal 2009 with solid results across the board keeping in mind that our first quarter service revenue which represents approximately 40% of our total revenue is based on a one quarter lag. Earnings, revenues and payment volumes all came in better than we anticipated going into the year. The resilience of our business could be seen in the contribution of our debit products in the US as consumers continue to more frequently use debit as a method of payment. In addition we also saw growth in credit products outside the United States particularly in emerging markets. That said the economic situation across the globe has had and will continue to have an effect on dollar payment volumes in the US and internationally for at least the next two to three quarters. On the other hand I should point out that Visa continues to benefit from growth in the number of transactions conducted over our network. As a reminder approximately 30% of our revenue is derived from the absolute number of transactions that take place over VisaNet. This volume grew 8% in the December quarter to almost 10 billion transactions demonstrating that even in severe economic times Visa continues to take volume from cash and checks. Now let me give you a brief overview of the financials for the quarter. Once again with the one quarter service revenue lag in mind net operating revenues in the first quarter were just over $1.7 billion an increase of 17% over the year ago period and ahead of our guidance. Operating margins which benefited from seasonal impact were strong as well and exceeded our stated full year guidance of the mid to high 40% range. Adjusted first quarter net income of $599 billion was 35% greater than the year ago period. As I mentioned we are now seeing signs of a more pronounced decline in US payment volume growth and global cross border volumes than we had expected going into our fiscal year. While we began 2009 with the expectation that revenue growth would slow to the high single digits in the back half of the year we are now projecting that growth to be in the low single digits. So our full year fiscal 2009 revenue now looks to be in the high single digits somewhere below our longer term guidance of 11% to 15%. In our next fiscal quarter however we continue to expect revenue growth to be in the middle of the 11% to 15% guidance range as it benefits from a one time $70 million addition to incentives in the prior year. This means that the normalized second quarter growth rate is expected to be in the mid to high single digits further decelerating in the second half of the year to the low single digits. On the positive side we are reducing expenses which based on the current trends we see for the year will help us meet our objective of 2009 diluted earnings per share growth of greater than 20%. Specifically we have accelerated our previously announced global integration effort. As we continue to integrate our previously independent operating units we are reducing duplication and prioritizing our project funding including our marketing spend which we expect to be somewhat below the level of fiscal 2008. As a result we are reaffirming our 2009 earnings per share and operating margin guidance. But let me be absolutely clear about our operating plan. All of these efforts will be consistent with fully funding our growth initiatives. Byron will provide additional detail on our guidance momentarily. Looking ahead to fiscal 2010 we are cautiously optimistic that we can regain our 11% to 15% revenue growth target assuming some recovery in the US economy and cross border volumes by early 2010 and the anticipated more favorable year-over-year comparisons on gas prices and foreign exchange rates. On that basis we reaffirm all of our guidance for 2010. Additionally we expect to achieve our earnings per share and operating margin targets even if the revenue growth is somewhat below our guidance range. To deliver these results in challenging times it is more critical than ever that we have the people and the mechanisms in place to effective engage our clients. We are focusing on their specific business needs and challenges and creating programs to help them build stronger and more profitable relationships with their customers. As we make our business decisions we will thoughtfully consider how our actions may impact our clients\u2019 businesses. Of course we take nothing for granted but we believe this commitment to client service combined with our product and network strengths position us well particularly during a period of intense consolidation in the banking industry. With that let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the financial results and our current thinking and financial guidance.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: Let me start with the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and then I\u2019ll touch on trends we are seeing for the quarter ending in December as well as some early results for January. As Joe mentioned it was an encouraging start to 2009 with solid revenue and earnings growth keeping in mind that service revenues which represent almost 40% of revenue are reported on a one quarter lag. Total payment volume through the end of September, 2008 grew 12% to $701 billion over the same quarter of 2007. During this time the US posted solid results growing 9% to $421 billion. Broken down further debit delivered a strong 14% growth while credit continue to moderate and slowed to 3% from the prior period\u2019s 5%. As a reminder our US payment volume is about equally distributed between debit and credit. On a constant dollar basis rest of world payment volume grew at 22% modestly higher than the 20% growth of the June quarter. In contrast to the September ending quarter cross border volume growth in the December ending quarter slowed to zero on a constant dollar basis down from low double digits in the prior period. This slowdown was broad based. Globally which excludes Visa Europe total cards outstanding for the period ending September grew 10% with 1.7 billion cards carrying the Visa brand. Credit cards grew 6% to 812 million cards while debit rose 14% to 864 million cards. Importantly international growth of 16% remains very healthy. Card growth combined with ongoing efforts to broaden acceptance and usage represent a significant opportunity. Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s which are reported with no quarterly lag totaled $9.8 billion in the first fiscal quarter an increase of 8% over the similar period a year ago. It is important to reiterate a point that Joe made at the beginning of this call. While payment volume and average ticket sizes are moderating in the face of much more difficult economic times our transaction counts which are an important component of our net revenue are growing very well as the underlying secular shift to electronic payments and more precisely to Visa continues. Turning to the income statement in the first quarter gross revenues of $2 billion were up 16% from the similar period in 2007. Volume and support incentives increased by $19 million to $269 million which represented 13% of gross revenue moderately below our expectations coming into the year. Volume and support incentives are recognized based on current quarter results and this decline was almost entirely a function of lower fiscal first quarter payment volumes which in turn resulted in lower payments and accruals. We expect that this dynamic will continue to provide some level of offset to lower revenue growth in our second quarter. Given our updated full year revenue projections we now expect 2009 volume and support incentives to be 14% to 16% of gross revenue down from our initial guidance of 16% to 17%. Net operating revenues were just over $1.7 billion a 17% increase over the operating revenues reported for the first fiscal quarter of 2008. Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $793 million up 8% over the prior year period and reflective of solid year-over-year payment volumes in all regions for the quarter ending September 30. Data processing revenue reporting on a current quarter basis was $554 million up 13% over the prior year. International transaction revenues also reported on a current quarter basis were up 33% to $505 million as moderating cross border volumes in the period were offset by competitive pricing modifications. Our adjusted operating margin which tends to be highest in our fiscal first quarter was approximately 48% above our full year guidance as Joe mentioned. In addition to seasonal impacts and better than anticipated expense savings the increase in margin was due to lower volume and support incentives which are recognized in the current quarter. I\u2019ll provide additional color on our margin expectations in a moment. On an adjusted basis operating expenses for the first quarter declined $29 million or 4% year-over-year driven by lower costs for personnel and professional fees as well as flat marketing spend. As Joe mentioned earlier our focus on costs is broad based and aimed at delivering the expense savings committed to by management during our IPO road show. Please note that while we had originally guided to flat marketing spend in fiscal 2009 versus 2008 our current expectation is that the spending level will be somewhat below the level of 2008. Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter approximately $40 million of which was dedicated to the build out of our new data center. The center will be fully operational by the fiscal fourth quarter. Moving on to the balance sheet we ended the first quarter in excellent shape with very little debt and cash, cash equivalents, available for sale investments and restricted cash of $5.6 billion. Of this total $2.6 billion is restricted cash which represents an amount sufficient to fully fund the American Express and Discover settlement. Two significant cash outflows are notable for the quarter. First in mid-October we redeemed all of the Series 2 and a portion of the Series 3 Class C shares that were held by Visa Europe for a total of $2.7 billion resulting in a single class of C shares and the elimination of our pro forma approach to share count and earnings per share. All Class C shares are now translatable one to one into Class A equivalent shares. Second at the end of December we delivered on our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders when Visa funded the litigation escrow by $1.1 billion directly from our cash balances instead of conducting an expensive follow on underwriting. This had the same effect as a stock repurchase and reduced the amount of shares outstanding for EPS calculation purposes by 20.8 million shares. While there was little effect to the average share count in the first fiscal quarter the full effect will be realized in the second quarter and beyond. As a result of these two transactions as of December 31st, 2008 Visa Inc. has 755 million Class A shares outstanding on an as converted basis and began the fiscal second quarter with a fully diluted Class share count of 756 million shares. Now let me comment on the trends we are seeing that will impact our results in the coming quarter and fiscal 2009. While we expect to hit the middle of our 11% to 15% revenue guidance range in our fiscal second quarter in part due to a nonrecurring $70 million addition to incentives in the prior year the back half of 2009 is now looking to be more challenging than we expected going into the year. This will have ramifications to our revenue projections in the third and fourth quarters though we remain committed to delivering our full year earnings per share and operating margin guidance. Specifically here in the US payment volume growth has declined from 9% in the September quarter to essentially flat in the December quarter. Deconstructing this further credit volume ended the period at a negative 6% while debit posted a 6% gain. More recently through the end of January aggregate US payment volume growth is trending relatively flat. Credit growth is negative in the mid single digits relatively unchanged form the December quarter and debit appears to have regained some momentum rising from positive low single digits in the month of December back to the mid single digit range in January. When you dig a little deeper into the underlying dynamics of these trends what we are seeing is that the steep in gas prices over the past several months has noticeably dampened payments growth despite notable growth rates in other categories of spend like recurring bill pay, quick service restaurants and health care. All of these categories tend to favor debit over credit in this environment which underlies some of the resilience of that product. Net, net this leaves us cautiously optimistic that debit will continue to sustain respectable growth in this tougher economic environment. Outside the United States for the quarter ending December, 2008 constant dollar payment volume growth rates declined from the low 20s to the mid teens. As mentioned earlier cross border volumes were flat in the December ending quarter and in January have declined to negative mid single digits. Now let me comment on what we see over the coming year as far as our operating performance is concerned and how it may impact our current guidance. As Joe previously mentioned on a full year basis we are projecting total net revenue to come in below the lower end of our 11% to 15% guidance range in the high single digits. While we still expect to achieve the middle of our 11% to 15% guidance range in the fiscal second quarter the third and fourth quarters are now shaping up to be more challenging than we had signaled last quarter with the probability of low single digit growth. This second half outlook also encompasses a more pronounced foreign exchange impact which on a year-over-year basis is expected to reduce revenue growth by about three percentage points. Despite the strong adjusted operating margin exhibited this quarter we are maintaining our long term guidance of the mid to high 40% range for adjusted operating margin through 2010. Though we should continue to realize incremental savings from our merger and cost initiatives given the pressure on revenues in the back half of the year the general uncertainty around the economy and our intention to continue investing for future growth we are staying with our current range. More importantly and to reiterate Joe\u2019s statement we remain on track to deliver our guidance of annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of greater than 20% for 2009. Looking beyond 2009 assuming some US economic recovery by early 2010 as well as more favorable comparisons particularly in cross border activity, gas prices and foreign exchange rates we expect to achieve our earnings per share and operating margin guidance. That concludes my comments so I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Joe.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Let me conclude by saying that it\u2019s important to remember that Visa\u2019s business in the US while vital to the company is only one part of a large and growing global enterprise. Despite the current economic headwinds our international growth opportunities both in credit and debit continue to offer us very attractive longer term prospects as economies expand and mature and payment systems evolve around the globe. When the economy of the US does turn for the better the actions we are taking now on expenses, on new product development in both credit and debit and on international expansion will pay enormous dividends over the long term. Thank you all for listening and with that we are ready to take questions. Question-And-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities: Regarding the \u201ccompetitive pricing changes\u201d around cross border I was wondering if you could just characterize how that plays with the regulators over there considering the environment particularly in Europe and my second question is can you characterize the level of your marketing spend that\u2019s tied to contractual obligations versus what\u2019s completely discretionary?\nJoseph W. Saunders: To begin with the pricing changes that we\u2019re talking about were made several quarters ago and they\u2019re being manifested in what we do now. This isn\u2019t a recent action. In the second regard the majority of our marketing spending is discretionary not non-discretionary. If that continues to be the case I would say that the traction that we\u2019re getting on marketing spend is mostly related to the efficiency of what we\u2019re doing today as opposed to what we did a year ago when we were a new company.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities: Which includes the recent consolidation of agencies?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Yes, the consolidation of agencies and frankly the lower cost of different types of media.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: Appreciate the commentary on the December volumes in the US. It\u2019s actually a bit better than we expected. I was just curious, it looks like US payment volume is tracking closer to retail sales than it has in the past. It sounded like it was flat, still a premium but not as big as the usual secular premium that we would see. I guess I was trying to better understand what do you think is driving that reduction in the premium? Is it really just lower average tickets and gas influencing that?\nJoseph W. Saunders: To a certain extent it\u2019s modestly lower average tickets which is related to the economy in general. Quick service restaurants and categories like that are increasing more rapidly than high end retail or travel or airlines. Having said that, fuel prices have a significant impact on our payment volume growth in the short run. If you go back through last October gas prices steadily increased to well over $4 a gallon. Depending on what week you\u2019re looking at they\u2019re around $1.70 a gallon right now, so there\u2019s a huge drop in the price of gas and gas accounts for about 10% of our total payment volume across both categories. So you have 10% of your volume where the cost of a gallon of gas is off by 40%, 45%. That obviously will not be the case in 2010 assuming everything stays the way it is you can do the numbers but it makes a difference in our growth rate.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: Did you see any noticeable change in average tickets or I guess the number of flights in the US in December? We got the volume data but I was just curious if you saw a similar trend in transaction counts.\nJoseph W. Saunders: I think as we said we saw the number of transactions go up at a pretty strong high single digit rate, I think we just said 8%, but the average ticket size in the aggregate is down by 5% I think. Not all of that is fuel but fuel is a considerable hunk of it.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan: Yes, because we\u2019ve been trying to focus more on transaction counts. I\u2019ll end by asking just to confirm the data processing line is primarily transaction based, correct, not volume based?\nJoseph W. Saunders: That\u2019s correct.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: 100% transaction based.\nJoseph W. Saunders: We\u2019re very pleased with the number of transactions going through our system in this period of time and frankly you can\u2019t look at it and not think that we\u2019re doing what we set out to do which is to compete with cash and checks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities.\nJason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities: I wanted to ask a question just to start off with, we\u2019re getting more inquiries from investors trying to separate cyclical and secular trends here. Obviously the cyclical part of the growth equation is getting a little bit more challenging which I don\u2019t think is surprising to anyone, but can you talk a little bit about the confidence level in the secular piece? There\u2019s obviously a lot of views out there that the days of easy credit are over and the consumer does go into a period of more sane deleveraging with an increased personal savings rate. To what extent do you guys think about that potential dynamic as you shape the outlook over the next year or so?\nJoseph W. Saunders: To begin with if you look at our combined debit and credit volume, 95% of the volume that goes through our system comes from people that use debit cards which don\u2019t have a credit limit or in those cases where it is a credit card from people that either pay their bill in full every month or occasionally revolve and never revolve at more than 50% of their line. So part of the answer is a lot of the volume that we have is not generated by people that are borrowing a lot of money. We\u2019ve got to keep reminding ourselves and everybody else that the growth in receivables in the credit card business has a lot to do with balance transfers in the acquisition of new accounts. Balance transfers, those loans that are created as a result of the balance transfers never go through our system. Those are transactions that are handled outside of Visa\u2019s system, if you will, so while they may come under a Visa branded product, they are not Visa volume to us. Having said that, it\u2019s clear that things are more difficult than they used to be and it\u2019s clear that our volumes are down as a result of the economy in the US and economies around the world although as we said our credit card volumes in some emerging countries remain quite strong. On the other hand our transactions are up and they appear to be up because we appear to be taking share from cash and checks in categories in the quick service restaurants, in the bill paying categories which are often larger dollar amount transactions, in supermarkets and wholesale retail chains and so forth and so on. I think that the answer that encourages me the most is if things begin to turn around even modestly we have structured ourselves to be poised to take advantage of it in a serious way.\nJason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities: That commentary is great and I think Adam has a follow up question for you.\nAdam Frisch - UBS Securities: Byron you were pretty clear that your expense reduction program would not interfere in your growth initiatives but is it also logical to think that once top line growth recovers at some point, hopefully sooner rather than later, you won\u2019t have to add back at least the bulk of these expenses? I guess another way to ask it is what you\u2019re cutting now, does it have to be added back later once revenue growth re-accelerates?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: I think we made clear from the beginning that not all of the savings that we would realize as a result of the merger would be flowed through to the bottom line and that we stand ready to reinvest a portion of those savings in new products and growth initiatives and that remains true. I think to help ground everyone as Joe indicated the margin for the first fiscal quarter is typically our highest throughout the fiscal year. We would expect margins to moderate through the balance of the year which is why frankly we are holding on margin guidance to mid to high 40%.\nJoseph W. Saunders: I would only add to that in relation to the question you asked, are the expenses that we are saving going to show back up when the economy gets better, the answer is no, they will not show up. They\u2019re going away.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nJulio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.: My question is really just I want to focus more on pricing and I know that we\u2019ve heard a lot of commentary, chatter, I\u2019ve been talking to a lot of folks out there that pricing increases are coming from Visa, MasterCard, prepare for that and I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand more than anything else, even if there were some pricing increases not necessarily the magnitude but where exactly should we be thinking about how each one of those pieces would flow through the revenue items? I guess if you could focus more on things like the card services line, the data processing fees and the cross border, how do we break out where or if you could provide a way to think about where those increases would really actually manifest themselves in the model?\nJoseph W. Saunders: I think in the short run I just suggested in my talk that we\u2019re going to be very careful about what we do given the fragile state of the bottom line of our clients particularly in the US. While I\u2019m not going to say we will do nothing, what we will do will be in concert with our partners and it will be done in a thoughtful, I think we\u2019ve said a thoughtful, surgical way and we\u2019re not going to back off that. That\u2019s not where we believe our greatest opportunity lies.\nJulio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Maybe in terms of the model itself, maybe Byron you could comment on thinking about the line items, where would it actually show up in the model if there were to be anything like that?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: The way we\u2019ve tried to be helpful is to elevate to an overall level of revenue guidance in combination with margin. I think we\u2019ve said from the beginning that in our first 12 to 18 months as a public company, as a merged entity, we had a lot of practices and a lot of opportunity to standardize and optimize our business across the globe. We are doing that and will basically have a non-normalized rate of growth through this year. But as we move beyond this year, again as we\u2019ve said before, that the vast majority of our revenue growth should be attributive to taking share from cash and check and growing our business with transactions and a higher penetration of PCV. We actually expect pricing to be a much more moderated impact over time on our revenue growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Kissane - Banc of America Securities.\nJames Kissane - Banc of America Securities: Byron, just following up on that, what portion of your revenue growth this year will be from the price increase? And then maybe just a quick follow up, when will the cross border pricing adjustments anniversary?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: Let\u2019s start with the second. The cross border pricing adjustment you\u2019re referring to were initiated in fiscal Q3 of 2008 so they will anniversary at the midway point of this fiscal year which is a contributing factor to our guiding down revenue growth in the second half. With regards to how much revenue is tied to price adjustments, that\u2019s not something that we have spoken to publicly and again we\u2019ve tried to be helpful by giving in this case relatively specific revenue guidance by quarter for all of 2009.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: One of the premises on which you\u2019re basing the 2010 outlook is a thought that maybe we find the bottom here at least in the US economy in 2009 and at least in credit volume. Is there anything anecdotally or otherwise that you see out there that makes you feel comfortable with that kind of projection? Is it the disconnect between the view of restriction of credit and the type of customer or the type of transaction that flows through the network? Or is there something else that makes you feel like that\u2019s something that we should be thinking about?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: Let me respond first by saying this is not a projection. What we have said is that if the economy in the US has some degree of recovery in early fiscal year 2010 in combination with some recovery of cross border in addition to more favorable comparisons specifically with gas prices and FX rates then we are confident that we will resume our revenue guidance of 11% to 15% growth. The way we\u2019re trying to be helpful here is if there, under those circumstances, we feel very comfortable in projecting revenue growth back into our guidance range.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Let me be just a little bit more specific. I don\u2019t know when the economy in the world is going to recover. When Byron suggests that there needs to be some recovery, that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying. If there is by around the first quarter of 2010, then I think we\u2019re in good shape. As it relates to the foreign exchange and the gas prices we\u2019re considerably more certain that that will happen so it\u2019s really a mix of the two. Remember I don\u2019t [need] the economy to recover to a point of where I have to get to the revenue guidance to continue to deliver the 20% earnings per share.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: As a follow up on contra-revenue it sounds like you\u2019re getting a little more constructive there, I guess, relative to your net revenue growth. Should we actually begin to see support and incentive payments fall as a percent of volume at some point in 2009?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: The way we\u2019ve articulated that is as a percent of gross revenue. Going into the year we had guided volume and support as a percent of gross revenue at 16% to 17%. Because growth has been a bit less than anticipated as a percentage of grows revenue that has fallen to in this case 13% for the quarter. Then we adjusted our guidance to 14% to 16% on a full year basis.\nJoseph W. Saunders: We don\u2019t expect it to remain that low.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Just a quick follow up on that last question, the 13% this quarter in the volume and support incentives, I assume that in your guidance for fiscal \u201909 is based on volumes staying relatively consistent with where they were in the fourth quarter in January. You\u2019ve taken it a leg down. Does that line item have more potential to drop and could it conceivably be as low as 10% of revenues or is it not that sensitive to volume falls?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Let me start out by reminding you that the incentives are booked on a current quarter basis and the revenues on a lag basis. You\u2019re talking about service revenues up to October and you\u2019re talking about incentive expense on a real time basis that occurred in the ensuing quarter.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: And I would just add to that, that the way the incentives would respond would be with diminishing returns. If payment volume growth was continued to slow there would be a diminishing dampening effect by incentives over time. It\u2019s not linear. The flipside to that is once you begin annualizing that and you have recovery, you have the same phenomena on the uptick that incentives will start to come back as growth in payment volumes begin to recover.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Your guidance for, in your commentary around cross border, it sounds like cross border did get worse in the month of January and once we hit the second quarter for running negative singles, did you like you were in January on terms of volumes we\u2019re going to see that in terms of revenues as well because pricing is going to anniversary. Is that in your guidance already, the negative cross border revenues by the second half of \u201909?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Everything that we know is in the guidance that we\u2019re giving you today. There is nothing that we\u2019ve talked about that we haven\u2019t thoughtfully considered in putting together the comments that we put together today. It doesn\u2019t suggest that things can get worse, but we have considered everything that we\u2019re looking to.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank North America.\nChristopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank North America: I guess just following up on that last question, maybe you could give a little more granularity on the slowdown. Is it broad based or could you touch on your major regions and specify if some regions are dragging down the overall volume numbers more than others? Then also a quick follow up, I don\u2019t know did you give the process transaction growth for January?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: With regards to regional granularity when the economic melees began to set in, different regions entered that zone at different time frames but I think it\u2019s fair to say today it\u2019s broad based. All our regions are experiencing declines, all the regions contributed to the reduction in growth in cross border.\nJoseph W. Saunders: That\u2019s true about cross border but we have seen transaction and payment volume growth in several of our emerging countries in some of our regions outside the United States.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: We have some countries that are excepting. On transactions processed we didn\u2019t give the January number. Our practice is to give it at the quarter which we will do at the next earnings call and that\u2019ll be for all three months.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Donald Fendetti - Citigroup.\n Donald Fendetti \u2013 Citigroup: Joe, I was wondering if you could give us an update on your debit expansion in Asia in terms of timing and your outlook there?\nJoseph W. Saunders: As you know we\u2019ve just begun a joint venture in Asia and we are in business, we have a number of clients in queue and over the next 24 to 36 months we think that that\u2019ll be a pretty valuable operation that will generate more than noticeable revenues. That\u2019s how we\u2019re starting to push debit out in Asia. We have debit initiatives going in other parts of the world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Moshe Katri - Cowen and Co.\nMoshe Katri - Cowen and Co.: Can you break down payment and transaction growth by regions, US, Europe, Asia Pacific? I think these are numbers that you gave us last quarter and then could you elaborate a bit more on your cost cutting initiatives I guess with the exception of advertising? Are we focusing more aggressively on personnel, systems, data centers, etc.?\nJoseph W. Saunders: I\u2019ll the answer the second question then Byron will answer the first question. As it relates to the second question what I said was that we are executing on what we said we would execute on in the IPO and that is to de-mutualize the company and to eliminate duplications and wind up focusing on implementing projects that make sense to the business and eliminating those things that were extraneous or duplicative. That is exactly what we\u2019re doing. One of the fallouts of that of course is that we\u2019re reducing our headcounts in certain places as it relates to this duplication, but that\u2019s essentially what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re putting together a company that is effective, efficient and focused and we\u2019re doing what we should be doing and we\u2019re doing what we promised we\u2019d be doing. It happens to coincide with a period of time where it\u2019s extremely appropriate and important that we get about the business of doing that and getting it done and that\u2019s what we\u2019re committing we will do.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: With regards to transactional data by region, let me refer you to our website and we will have posted today for the period ending September 30th all the detailed statistics of which transaction by region are included and are available for you to access.\nMoshe Katri - Cowen and Co.: Just to verify, did you say that average ticket prices were down 5%?\nJoseph W. Saunders: No, we did not. We didn\u2019t give any specific quantitative on average tickets.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: Joe said it was about 5% in aggregate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods: Joe, I guess I just want a little bit more clarity on that 2010 guidance. Is there a base level of revenue growth in that year that would lead you to believe that 20% EPS growth is still achievable?\nJoseph W. Saunders: We\u2019re pretty confident at this point but without knowing in absolute terms what\u2019s going to happen that the things we know will change off of the base line that we expect in the third and the fourth quarter will get us to where we need to go. We think it could get us back up to the 11% to 15% range. We think it could fall short of that and still deliver the 20% earnings per share. You could stress test it all the way down the hill, but we\u2019re reasonably confident that we\u2019re in pretty good shape knowing what we know now.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: Just to build on that a moment, we guided in the second half of the fiscal year to a probability of low single digit revenue growth. As Joe mentioned earlier what we do know is where gas prices have been and what we will anniversary in terms of gas pricing. We also expect to favorably anniversary the change in FX. We then went on to say that in order to get back into our revenue guidance range, that we would depend on at least some recovery in cross border and some recovery in the US. Joe went on to say that even if we underperformed our revenue guidance somewhat, we could still hit 20% or better EPS growth. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve tried to frame it for you all.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods: So we could think maybe high single digits still achievable, maybe below a little bit?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: I think we\u2019ve given you a pretty good frame. You should take it from there.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods: On capital management, I was wondering where we were with that? I think you guys still have a fair amount of cash. Any intentions of instituting another share repurchase above and beyond the 1.1?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: As I mentioned earlier in the remarks we did 1.1 billion of share repurchase in the month of December and we have ample opportunity to go back to our Board to seek additional authorization at a time and an amount that management feels appropriate.\nJack Carsky: Stacy, we probably have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray.\nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: I just want to make sure the foreign exchange effect on revenue, I think you said in the back of the year was only 3%.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: In the back half of the year we said that it was three full percentage points of impact on growth. That\u2019s on the company\u2019s entire growth rate. That\u2019s currently the ballpark that we\u2019re contemplating.\nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: The change in currencies, the dramatic change we saw over the last 90 days, the net effect of that is only 300 basis points on the growth rate?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: On the year-over-year growth rate.\nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: The effect on profitability?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: In the way that we hedge we hedge the economic exposure so revenue less expenses is an income exposure, we hedge the income. From an economic standpoint that\u2019s hedged. When we gave the guidance for 20% or better EPS growth that\u2019s on an as reported basis. The foreign exchange impacts are fully contemplated in that guidance.\nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: I want to make sure I heard this right, you said fuel was before the decline in fuel prices was 10% of all spending on your card? That\u2019s higher than I\u2019d heard from other.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr.: Joe said about 10% in the US.\nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Last question, there was a major security breach in the industry here in the US and I think that there is the risks of security breaches in the industry are going up. I was wondering if you could comment on that and how concerned you are about that and what economic effects you think the security breach that is out there could have on various players in the industry?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Obviously we\u2019re aware of it and obviously we\u2019re involved in the correction of it and obviously we\u2019re concerned that it happened. We believe that we have made a considerable amount of progress through PCI for lack of a better term to mitigate the possibility that these things happen. There have been some that have occurred but frankly not many. Having said that, to us one of the most important things is that in that regard we have promised consumers that they will never be financially liable for anything like this occurring to them. That is totally in tact and consumers can feel comfortable using Visa cards and comfortable in the notion that no security breach will ever financially affect them. I think that this is the most important thing. We\u2019ve got to work on making sure that nobody in the process gets hurt but our promise is the consumer and the confidence is directed at the consumer and I\u2019m happy to say that that continues to be 100% in effect.\nJack Carsky: Thank you all very much.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Saunders: Thanks, Jack, and as always, thank you all for joining us today. Visa closed out our fiscal 2010 with another solid quarter, delivering net operating revenues of over $2.1 billion, which was a 13% increase over last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payment volume, cross-border volume and Visa processed transactions coming from all areas of the globe. For all of fiscal 2010, net revenue was a record $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over 2009. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes the gain from revaluing the Visa Europe put was $695 million, a 35% increase over prior year. This equates the diluted earnings per share of $0.95, a 38% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, adjusted net income was $2.9 billion, a 23% increase over 2009. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $3.91, 26% ahead of last year. Importantly, we delivered on all of the guidance we laid out at the start of our fiscal year. On a separate front, we completed the repurchase of $800 million worth of Class B stock earlier this month or approximately 11 million shares on an as converted basis. And today, we announced the authorization of the new $1 billion share repurchase program for fiscal 2011. Well, last week, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% over the prior year. All of these actions reaffirmed our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders, a commitment that we initially wait out almost three years ago. But of course we will only do this after all appropriate investment and opportunities to fuel future growth have been funded. We continue to take steps to solidify our foundation for long-term growth. We successfully renewed several client contracts during the quarter. Importantly, this includes securing the early renewal of a major relationship that now leaves us with no major renewals until the beginning of fiscal 2013. While there are challenges to address, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the changing environment and we remain committed to being a growth company. Well, Byron will discuss in greater detail our overall guidance for 2011, and the new once as therein. I'm pleased to report that we will continue to target 11% to 15% net revenue growth, greater than 20% earnings per share growth, and are raising our free cash flow guidance to greater than $3 billion. Our current guidance takes into account a step up in our global investments. This also includes resources to respond effectively to any changes in the U.S. debit landscape. Visa will remain focused on maintaining its industry leadership through growth and innovation. Backstopping that leadership has been a willingness to apply the necessary investment dollars behind new initiatives, expansion and defending our position in the U.S. market. We recognize that we must remain adaptable and innovative appropriately addressing the economic, regulatory or legal challenges before us. We believe we have made good progress in working with the U.S. government to bring clarity to two important issues that directly impact our business. First, we resolve the Department of Justice. And second, we have met with the Federal Reserve staff on multiple occasion to discuss Visa's place in the payments industry and the industry in general. We are encouraged by the open and inclusive process that has been adopted. As we have been saying, we have to wait until the rules were finalized to provide you with more detail regarding the financial impact this year and in ensuing years. With that being said, we are not setting idly buy. We have had a team in place for several months focusing on how we will evolve our U.S. debit strategy based on potential outcomes of the Fed's rulemaking process. As a result, we have developed a range of strategy options that we will choose from when the time comes. It's very important to keep financial reform and perspective. Our foundation remains solid. We are diversified global business and a growth industry, and we will continue to invest to develop our acquired products and services that drive long-term growth. There's been a lot written of late [ph] about Visa's prospects with the U.S. debit market given recent legislative developments. Let me give you my perspective about this. There is a reason we have a strong leadership position in this market. We have the best processing technology, value-added services and brand in the business. We will continue to use those assets to win in the marketplace. Let me now turn the call over to Byron to take you through the details of our financial results, and then I'll be back to provide some context on what we are thinking about from a global investment and opportunity perspective.\nByron Pollitt: Thank you, Joe. In today's call, I'm going to cover first our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the June and September quarter, as well as payment and transaction results for the first three weeks of October. Remember, the June quarter in forms are fiscal fourth quarter service revenue. Please note that we have also included CyberSource payment volume statistics to our operational performance data supplement beginning this quarter. Following the review of our revenue drivers, I'll cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and full year, followed by guidance for fiscal year 2011. Given yesterday's informational call on CyberSource revenue impact, changes in income state presentation related to our Visa Extras business and non-Visa processed transactions and the revaluation of the Visa Europe put, I will not today specifically address these topics. If you missed the call, the webcast, the replay and associated PowerPoint presentation is on our website, and you can reach out to our IR team for any additional clarification. Global payment volume growth for the June quarter, in constant dollar, was 14% flat from the March period. Meaningful growth was sustained in every region of the globe. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 14% in the June quarter, up from 13% in the March quarter. Rest of world payment volume, on a constant dollar basis, was 14% in the June quarter, essentially flat to the 15% rate delivered in the March quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. Turning to the most recent quarter, September global payment volume growth, in constant dollar, was 14%, same as the June quarter. In the U.S., payment billion growth was 13% in the September quarter, down slightly from 14% in the June quarter. Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 14% in the September quarter, flat from a 14% rate in the June quarter. More recently, through the 21st of October, U.S. payment volume growth held steady at 13%. Global cross-border volume growth accelerated considerably in the June quarter, posting a 17% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the 12% rate in the March period. In the September quarter, global cross-border volume growth delivered a strong 16% growth as the world economy continues to mend. October cross-border volume growth on a constant dollar basis sustained the momentum we saw in the September quarter, posting a 17% rate of growth through the 21st of the month. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12.1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 16% over the similar period a year ago and ahead of the 14% growth rate we saw in the June quarter. Processed transactions through the 21st of October continued their growth at 16% over the prior year period. CyberSource billable transactions on a pro forma basis totaled $829 million for the quarter, a very strong 36% growth rate and $3 billion for the year, an equally impressive 32% rate of growth. We expect continued strength in this part of our business as e-commerce activity continues to grow both in the U.S. and internationally. Please see our operational performance data supplement for a history of CyberSource's billable transactions. Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal fourth quarter, gross revenues of $2.5 billion were up 15% from a similar period in 2009. For all of 2010, gross revenues were $9.6 billion or up 18% over the prior year. Net operating revenues in the quarter were $2.1 billion, a 13% increase over 2009, driven by a sustained economic recovery, ongoing secular growth and the two months of revenue contributed by CyberSource, which totaled $41 million. Visa, without CyberSource, grew 11% in the quarter. For the full fiscal year 2010, net revenues were $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over the prior year. Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenues was $912 million, up 13% over the prior year period and reflective of strong payment volume growth in the quarter ending June. Keep in mind that our previously announced price adjustment enacted in July will not manifest itself until our fiscal first quarter of 2011. Data processing revenue was $840 million, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on a similarly strong processed transaction growth rate. Also influencing this quarter's revenue was a $37 million contribution from the CyberSource acquisition. As I mentioned in our call yesterday, the majority of CyberSource's revenues flow through the decline. International transaction revenue were up 22% to $619 million due to the sustained improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. We have not seen any signs of protracted slowdown in cross-border volumes suggesting a continued healthy global travel outlook. Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenue came in at 17%, a little higher than the run rate in our first three quarters due to the successful signing of certain contract renewals during the quarter, which carried a high-level of one-time contra-revenue incentive. As Joe already mentioned, we are quite pleased that we were able to re-sign these issuers. Total operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter were $1 million, flat to the year ago period despite the incremental addition of approximately $50 million in expense from the CyberSource acquisition. Absent this impact, the year-over-year quarterly decline was driven primarily by lower marketing and advertising spend. For the full fiscal year 2010, expenses were also flat, coming in at $3.5 billion versus $3.4 billion in 2009 and in line with our guidance going into this year. For the quarter, our operating margin was 53% as a result of slightly higher expenses and the two-month impact of CyberSource, which were all of 2010, the operating margin was 57% in line with our guidance of mid- to high-50s. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter and full year was a positive 1% as a result of continued weakness of the U.S. dollar in combination with our currency hedges. The CyberSource acquisition added an incremental $60 million to operating expenses this quarter, including $15 million of depreciation and amortization, as well as some minor stock compensation expense. Set against the $41 million of incremental revenue, the two months of CyberSource on the book were approximately $0.02 diluted to the quarter. As we telegraphed on last quarters call, we expected an elevated tax rate this quarter due to the impact of the CyberSource acquisition, the true up of our estate tax rate and the related adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities recorded as part of our October 2007 reorganization. In the end, it was not as impactful as we had expected, though the rate still approach 38%, excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. This resulted in a full year tax rate of 37%, excluding again the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. As discussed on yesterday's call, we have decreased the value of the Visa Europe put by $79 million, primarily reflecting a contraction in Visa Inc.'s P/E ratio [Price/Earnings ratio]. This nonrecurring, nontaxable event was flowed through the fourth quarter income statement, resulting in a reported EPS of $1.6 for the quarter and $4.1 for the year removing the put $0.11 impact yields and adjusted EPS of $0.95 for the quarter and $3.91 for the full year, which equates to 26% growth for the year.  Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter and totaled $241 million for all of 2010. This represents ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiative. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter and the year in the same strong position in which we began, negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.9 billion is restricted cash, which represents an amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the next six quarters with $1.5 billion that's currently uncommitted. As of the end of fiscal Q4, Visa's outstanding share count was $727 million on an as converted basis. Earlier this month, we placed $800 million into the litigation escrow, which had the effect of an 11 million share buyback. On a pro forma basis, this will reduce the share count to $716 million. As Joe mentioned earlier, our Board recently authorized another $1 billion repurchase program beyond the $800 million repurchase just completed. We are now on track to return to shareholders $1.8 billion via share buybacks plus over $400 million in dividends in fiscal 2011. As perspective, during the past two fiscal years, Visa has repurchased $3.3 billion in stock and paid $0.7 billion in dividend, returning in total $4 billion to shareholders. Fiscal year 2011 is on track to add $2.2 billion to that total. Now let me cover our expectations for fiscal 2011 and beyond. We are currently targeting net revenue growth to be in the same 11% to 15% range that we have guided to since our IPO. Our underlying assumptions for setting this include continued global economic recovery and a steady contribution from cross-border volume. Also, as we are substantially hedged through the end of our fiscal 2011, we expect no significant impact from currency fluctuations. We have assumed impact from the financial reform act, primarily in our fiscal fourth quarter. In addition as discussed on yesterday's call, please note that our revenue growth expectations for 2011 reflect 12 months of CyberSource operations in 2011 versus two months in fiscal year 2010; $89 million of Visa Extras revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011; and $140 million of non-Visa processed transaction revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will also not repeat in fiscal year 2011. With the early renewal of a major relationship in Q4 and with no major contracts up for renewal for the next two years, volume and support incentives should be in the range of 16% to 16\u00bd% for the year. Our expectation for full year 2011 operating margin is about 60% based on the reduction in Visa Extras expense and a lower media costs due to the absence of the major Olympic or World Cup event, marketing spend should come in at under $900 million. Our full fiscal year 2011 tax rate should be in the range of 36\u00bd% to 37%. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2011 on an adjusted basis, inclusive of the addition of CyberSource to both years, but excluding the impact from revaluing the Visa Europe put. Capital expenditures are slated to be in a range of $250 million to $275 million, reflecting additional investment over 2010 in several key growth initiatives, including e-commerce and CyberSource. And lastly, we are projecting free cash flow for the year to exceed $3 billion, reflective of our solid earnings trend. That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back over to Joe.\nJoseph Saunders: Thanks, Byron. Earlier, I noted my confidence in the future of Visa. Over more than 50 years, our organization has established a track record of adapting and flourishing during times of change by driving unique intangible value to clients, consumers, merchants and economy. So as we close the prepared portion of this call, I want to leave you with one important theme: Investment. Visa is today and will remain tomorrow a growth company. To extend that position, we are focused on strategically deploying our substantial capital to invest in areas of opportunities with significant long-term growth potential. Our two biggest areas of investment will continue to be international expansion and innovation, both of which are key accelerants to growing Visa share of the secular trend. At the same time, we will come you to protect our position globally in all aspects of our business. Regarding international expansion, earlier this year we stated our strategic aspiration to drive 50% of our revenues from outside the United States by fiscal year 2015. Our strategic plan for fiscal year 2011 and beyond includes several initiatives that will help us achieve this goal. First and foremost, we have developed and began investing in aggressive programs to accelerate growth in key markets around the world beginning with Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. We are also shifting market resources to place increased emphasis on key nine U.S. geographies. In fiscal 2011, we will invest upwards of 60% of Visa's marketing spend on markets outside the United States, where we are focused on driving growth in the affluent segment and debit as a point-of-sale. And importantly, we are investing significant resources to engage directly with local governments in key markets around the world, highlighting our Visa's network, products and services can help meet their needs and spur economic growth. I can tell you that many of these conversations are leading to more productive relationships that will help grow our local business. Because the fact is the scale, reach and sophistication of our network delivers a compelling value proposition, particularly in emerging markets. Innovation is also a top growth priority in investment focus. I'm pleased to say we have made progress on a number of fronts this quarter to deliver tangible consumer facing innovations to market. For instance, as the global leader in developing mobile payment, we now stand on the threshold of bringing this new technology to consumers in the United States. As we speak, we are working with many of our largest banks in the country to pile it and commercialize mobile payment programs, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and U.S. Bank. What excites us the most about our mobile contact of solutions is that it's scalable, it allows customers to use existing bank accounts and it works with most smart phones in the United States today. We've also seen excellent traction with money transfer. Just last week, in addition to several other initiatives in which we are engaged in India, the Reserve Bank of India granted us permission to begin offering inbound cross-border remittances to eligible Visa debit and Visa prepaid card holders issued in India and allows the Visa clients in India to promote our money transfer capability. This service is up and running and generating revenue today. And of course, our investment in CyberSource is already paying off. You may have seen that on Monday, we took a major step forward in enhancing and opening the authorized .NET development center to independent developers. Put simply, we recognize that innovative ideas come from many people and places. By combining the power of our flexible and secure network, with the community of developers creating new payment applications, we are paving the way for the next generation of payment innovations to come to market quickly and for the benefit of all stakeholders. I look forward to reporting out on the progress of this and our other key investments over the coming fiscal year. Finally, speaking of CyberSource, I want to close by welcoming CyberSource employees to the Visa fold and thanking our entire employee base for their contributions to our success in fiscal 2010. We delivered a stellar year amidst much changed, thanks to their collective effort. And with that, we're ready to take questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nBryan Keane: I guess, Byron, I would just hoping you could quantify the financial reform impact in the fourth quarter that you guys are taking into account?\nByron Pollitt: We have, I presume, that you mean the fourth quarter of next year, fiscal year '11? So we have accounted for that with certain assumptions, which will be more forthcoming about once we actually see the rules written. So I think the key takeaway here is that management is very comfortable with the guidance that we have given, recognizing that what impact there might be would be limited to the largely limited to the fourth quarter. And we are comfortable with our guidance, reflecting that period for the upcoming year end when the Fed is more explicit about rulemaking, then we'll be able to have a more informed discussion and more informed guidance with regards to fiscal year, frankly fiscal year '11, but more importantly, beyond fiscal year '11.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMC [JPMorgan].\nTien-Tsin Huang: I wanted to ask about the incentives and the large renewal. The incentives came in a little bit better than we expected but I just wanted to clarify, did the large renewal require any unusual term or pricing concession? And I'm curious, did this renewal get captured in the quarter in terms of incentives or is that something will -- the end of coming quarters?\nByron Pollitt: The incentives that were a part of the renewal were very much in line with the guidance we had given earlier. It did have an impact in the fourth quarter as we anticipated. There are no specific call outs, and it is fully embedded in our guidance for 2011.\nOperator: Next question comes from Moshe Katri - Cowen.\nMoshe Katri: Byron, looking at fiscal year 2011, how should we think about the quarterly revenue progression and then EBIT margins? And also for the first time since you went public, I guess advertising and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales declined sequentially, and we're also expecting advertising and marketing to be below $900 million in fiscal year 2011. That's also below the $1 billion bar that you've had since you went public. Maybe you can give us some color on some of these trends?\nByron Pollitt: We don't comment on a quarterly progression. We wait for the earnings calls to do that to try and be helpful. What we particularly since that we have some unevenness in the progression of the quarters. We prefer to guide at the annual level and with giving you both guidance and margin. Clearly, if you were to look at fiscal year 2010, it was a recovery year. So the comps that we are lapping in 2011 are going to get progressively tougher as you move through the year. And I think that's the perspective, which suggests you view the course of the year. And then of course, to the extent that we have factored in some impact from the Durbin, that's largely a fourth quarter event. So those, from that standpoint, that's a perspective on the quarterly. With regards to marketing, you're right. We, up to this point, our guidance has been under $1 billion based on the change in income statement, presentation that we will be making with regards to Visa Extras, which is one of the topics that was in yesterday's pre-earnings call. There will be $89 million worth of marketing expense that will have been booked in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011. And so that gets you along way towards moving from under $1 billion to under $900 million.\nOperator: Next question comes from Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus.\nChristopher Brendler: Just a quick question regarding the outlook, you mentioned the October trends looking relatively in line with what you saw in the September quarter,, but it appears to me that the comparisons will get tougher as you head deeper into the calendar fourth quarter and as early as you head into 2011. Do you expect a material slowdown in volume growth embedded in your guidance? Or are there other offsets that will keep volume growing at double digits?\nByron Pollitt: We have assumed that there is a continuing modest recovery through the course of the year, and so that would be a positive growth in volumes in each of the quarters year-over-year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott.\nThomas McCrohan: Byron, in terms of composition from a different revenue categories, should we be thinking about data processing and related fees becoming increasingly more a big of a proportion of overall fees over the next two to three years?\nByron Pollitt: Because the CyberSource revenue is largely going to be booked to data processing, you should expect that that, that will have a lift in data processing revenue, certainly initially as a portion of our mix and then we'll just have to see how we grow the other categories to see how it sorts out. But near term, there will be a lift because roughly, 90% of the CyberSource revenues will be booked to data processing fees. And that is also a subject that was covered in yesterday's pre-earnings call for those that would like to explore that a bit further.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Perlin - RBC.\nDaniel Perlin: I just wanted to explore incentive fees combined with the marketing spending, as we think about next year. And the 16% to 16\u00bd% incentive fees are a little bit lower than I would've thought, given in fact that you have been using that product or I guess incentive line to drive kind of that global acceptance. So have you changed the way you're thinking about that going forward? And then secondly, when you put those two categories together meaning marketing, spending and total incentives, because the market is seeing a reduction in Interchange and therefore, not funding much loyalty points, is that also having an effect and is that part of what you're talking about in terms of adjusting for this financial reformat?\nByron Pollitt: Let me give you the three drivers that are impacting incentives and holding it into that 16% to 16\u00bd% range. First, many of our incentive arrangements are tied to year-over-year growth. And when you have growth in a given year, that resets the base of which incentives are paid the following year. And so with fiscal year 2010 being a recovery year, we had an unusually large bump in incentives because there was a steeper recovery in 2010 versus 2009 versus what we would expect in '11 versus '10. So that in effect acts as a dampener. Number two, there are no major contract renewals scheduled for 2011. And so this will be a much more normalized year as it relates to incentives. And then finally, third, we will be adding in the CyberSource revenue into our total and the CyberSource revenue typically doesn't carry with it incentives. So you put those three together and that's the principal reason why we are settling in at a 16% to 16\u00bd% rate.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Kissane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJames Kissane: Byron, in the past you've given longer term guidance say you're going out two years, tonight you're only going out to F11. Is it primarily due to the Durbin uncertainty or are there other factors involved?\nByron Pollitt: It is our custom to give detailed guidance when you're out, which is what we're observing this year. And it would be our expectation that once we have a more definitive clarification from the Fed for the rules going forward, that we would then be in a position to give a much more informed and thoughtful guidance for 2012. So we're going to wait until we can talk about 2012 with that context.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.\nAndrew Jeffrey: PayPal has become increasingly vocal and aggressive competitively, especially in mobile and gateway solutions. And I just wonder, I know it's been a big partner of CyberSource over the years. I'm wondering if you could just give sort of a competitive commentary in terms of how you view PayPal in a lot of ways? They're no friends of your customers as they sort of SAP interchange revenue. So I just wonder, kind of what you think the long-term relationship is between PayPal and CyberSource?\nJoseph Saunders: A lot of the transactions on PayPal are Visa transactions, and I don't necessarily expect that to change in the matter in front [ph]. As it relates to whether we consider PayPal to be a competitor, the answer is, of course, we do. And there are a number of things that we have done and are doing that some of which we talked about on this call, some of which we talked about at our Investor Day, but we are doing to compete not just with PayPal but other emerging payment schemes. And we are focused on investing in and promoting those things that we do best and fit in best with our business. We're going to continue to do that and that's pretty much where Visa is.\nByron Pollitt: Yes, and I would just add that in the way that CyberSource deploys, we have the larger enterprise customers and then we have the much smaller businesses that do business in e-commerce are Authorize.net brand under CyberSource is the one that competes successfully in that space. And so that's to the extent that there is more, that PayPal is an alternative or Authorize.net is an alternative, it would be more in that space. Otherwise, transactions, as Joe said, transactions carried across PayPal automatically offer Visa as an alternative and we have a big role to play as in supporting PayPal in their payment system in that regard.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Frisch with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Frisch: Just wanted to address the incentives with the renewal. It was called out, obviously, it was one of your largest issuers and I'm presuming they issued debit cards. And if incentives didn't jump and there was no unusual call outs from the time where I guess you could say banks have some incremental leverage given the Durbin uncertainty, should we assume that similar discussions are happening with other banks? And maybe the concerns about them coming after you for a concessions maybe overdone or is just one bank that should be taken as a standalone incident?\nJoseph Saunders: We completed a transaction with a large client this quarter and it was a standalone transaction, period. And it included the Credit Card business, the Debit Card business and the Prepaid business. And so and that's about all I can say about it. I don't think that is anything we did or have done with that or others is particularly inconsistent. I don't think that there's anything about this that is highly unusual in comparison to other contracts that we signed.\nByron Pollitt: Yes, let me just emphasis that point, if I could, Adam, so that my earlier comments were not misinterpreted. Incentives were higher in the quarter. They were 17%. That's high for us. A more normalized level is a 16% to 16\u00bd%. We had a number of major contracts with one large contract in particular that came together and was consummated in this quarter. We had telegraphed several quarters ago that this was a situation that was likely to happen and that it was important to interpret our guidance on a full-year basis, not what happens in a particular quarter. And so those, the deals that we anticipated were brought to resolution in the quarter. Incentives came in at roughly 17% and are baked into our guidance for next year in terms of the full-year impact.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Maurer - CLSA. Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc. I was hoping you could add some color around your thoughts on Brazil? I was wondering if you've seen any increase in your growth trajectory following the dissolution of exclusivity and acquiring market, which I know has increased competition for new merchants there dramatically?\nByron Pollitt: I think it's too early. First of all, our growth in Brazil is very attractive. It's a robust economy and our business in Brazil is very strong. We think it's still a bit early to attribute any growth to the restructured arrangement that is in Brazil. Hard to differentiate given that economies are recovering from a recession. I think it's safe to say that Brazil is very attractive, high-priority market for us and we expect great things from that country still to come.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bruce Harting - Barclays.\nBruce Harting: In the discussions that you described as open and cooperative, is there any news on having a tech solution for differentiating banks below $10 billion, for example? And any color input you might have on differentiation between signature in pen and the way they said is looking at that issue? And then if I may, just on the mobile, is one of the things as you described working with the banks on rollout of pilot programs and things like that, how is the cost of that research split? And is that one of the embedded benefits you give to your clients as you explore new payment technologies that's a key part of your pricing scheme?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, as it relates to the first part of your question relating to the Fed, our conversations with the Fed have been focused on the competitive landscape in the Debit business, the substantial investments and ongoing investments that are required to keep the global payment system running securably and reliably. We talk to them why we believe cardholders should have the right to choose which payment networks throughout their transactions on and why consumers are making network choice expect to receive benefits of their selection fraud benefits, chargeback benefits, rewards and promotions, things like that. But so that's the kind of dialogue that we've had with the Fed. As it relates to how the Fed interprets it and as it relates to how the Fed interprets the question of signature versus pen and how many issuers they have to have, we continue to believe that there would be a single signature issuer and at least two pen issuers. Now that doesn't mean that that's going to happen. But we don't know what's going to happen until we see what they come out with. I think that to say that our meeting with them is open and constructive. It's open in the sense that they are curious about the business, curious about what's going on, interested in knowing what our thoughts are and I think we've done it in a way that they at least trust the data that we're giving them. As it relates to how they digest that data and what they do with it or what they feel that they can do with it, that remains to be seen.\nByron Pollitt: On the mobile front, much of what we do is you would consider R&D spending, and we do the investment. We incur costs, but we don't try and cover the full gamut. And so where we have other -- where there's other expertise required, we might, for example, do a joint venture with another technology company, which is exactly the case with the joint venture we have with Monetize. So they are another capability that we blend with ours in order to provide a more turnkey mobile payment platform for our clients. So hopefully, that addresses your question.\nJoseph Saunders: I think, Bruce also mentioned the under $10 billion financial institutions in the call out [ph]. And look, as we have said consistently and we said prior to the law being past, that's a very, very difficult thing to get to that requires a number of different entities to do things in order to achieve that out. Having said that, it's the law and if it continues to be the law, and I have no reason to expect that well [ph], then we will do our darndest to make sure that we adhere to the law. And as it relates to how that can be done, I can't give -- Visa cannot give you the blueprint to do it without the cooperation of other in these.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Parker - Lazard Capital Markets.\nDavid Parker: A few weeks ago, you launched your first debit card in Canada, and it appears that you can only do -- it's limited to certain transaction like online and over the phone, and so forth. Can you just update us on the opportunity that you see for that market and when you feel that you might be able to do all types of transactions, including the face to face point-of-sale?\nJoseph Saunders: Some of the rules put forward by the competition committee in Canada make viewing a full-blown debit product somewhat problematic. And so I don't know exactly when or if we'll get to an ultimate end state. I mean, I think we have to see how things unfold again. But we remain excited about rolling out of debit product a couple weeks ago, and we think that there's a place in the market for the product and we have been very encouraged by what's happened since we introduced it. And the activity was some institutions that aren't currently part of the process, but are now looking forward to join in. So we'll see.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs.\nJulio Quinteros: Just really quickly on the contract renewals that you guys assigned through fiscal 2013, what is the specifics around financial reform coming through in regards to that? So in other words, once you guys see the final ruling, can those contracts we renewed? Can it be forced open? Would you guys be forced to do anything that isn't already sort of built into the contract? How do you guys have that sort of structure? It'd be helpful.\nJoseph Saunders: All of our contracts are with individual financial institutions. They all have different nuances and none which am I going to publicly discuss since they are confidential.\nOperator: The next question comes from Don Fandetti - Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti: Joe, there's been a little bit of talk in Washington about maybe reference to tweak Durbin or even sort of push for a longer implementation time period. Do think that's a possible scenario? And then also just want to get your sense and your comfort on the non-U.S. regulatory environment?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, I mean, an answer to your first question, I mean that, that conversation does exist. And from our point of view, we'll do whatever we can to make the ultimate outcome as plowable to us as we possibly can. So I wouldn't count on anything happening, but there is conversation there. There's possibilities and we pursue those possibilities. As it relates to regulation outside the United States, I mean, we mentioned in the talking points today that we've made a considerable amount of progress, particularly in those countries that we're most interested in doing business in. And I think that, that who's on that front is generally pretty good news. I'm talking about Russia, I'm talking about Brazil. Even to some extent China, where our business is, I think, we have almost the largest revenue increased for any country outside the United States in China, where we get the share and business continues to be robust there. So I see this being a continuing situation. I don't think that government interest or government regulation is necessarily going to go away anywhere in the world. But from our point of view, we are learning to adapt and use our technology to everyone's benefit. And so far, it's working quite well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Drew Dampier - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group.\nDrew Dampier: Byron, I believe that a month ago at Barclay's conference, you gave some guidance on how much you said that contributes to your overall revenues. I think you said about 16%. I know MasterCard said it's up 15% of their revenues. I know you can't really comment directly on their pricing, but can you just help me to understand why those ratios to be so similar given your transaction mix? I just would've thought yours would be a bit higher?\nByron Pollitt: So let me correct that. If you -- what we tried to do was narrow the debit revenue that we thought would be potentially impacted by Durbin. And that's a little over 20% of our total global revenue. So a little over 20%. We actually have more revenue in debit than that, but the increment above that level, we don't see that as being impacted by the Durbin Legislation. So it's a little over 20%. And then within that, we had a breakdown between pen and signature. But I think the key thing here relative to the statistic you had was it's a little over 20% that would of domestic U.S. debit revenue that could potentially be impacted by Durbin.\nOperator: The next question comes from Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer.\nGlenn Greene: I guess just the first the question might be pricing benefits that might be embedded in 11% to 15% net revenue growth guidance, are there any specific call outs other than sort of the assessment fee increase that I think I heard was going to be effect in the first quarter?\nByron Pollitt: So on pricing, let me first restate our longer term perspective, which is one to two percentage points. In the revenue guidance that we gave specifically for fiscal year 2011, we have not assumed any pricing lift in that revenue guidance. If we do have any pricing realized, then it would be an upside to the projection.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Just have a quick question on the card service fee revenue line. One of the metrics I look at is just card service fees revenues relative to payments volume, and that margin has contracted quite a bit year-over-year. And I was just wondering how should we should think about it going forward, understanding that I think the pricing change affects that line as well?\nByron Pollitt: On card service fees -- give me one moment here. So if we were to look at what occurred in the fourth quarter, the pricing as you bridge from Q3 to Q4, some of that is due to the contract renewals, multiple that we had during the quarter. And then we have a mix issue here, it's not really an issue, it's just a phenomena. We have outside the United States, we are experiencing faster growth in geographies that do not have as high a service fee yield. And so the combination of a shift in the geographic origin of where the revenue, the payment volume is coming from, relative to the service fee yield and the impact in the fourth quarter of contract renewal together explain most of the shift.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group.\nDavid Hochstim: I wonder if you could just talk about the personnel expense of what we might expect in 2011? There are a lot of hiring to do outside U.S. and should we expect the same kind of seasonality next year in that number?\nByron Pollitt: Yes, so in personnel, I think, first of all, the principal driver, the personnel expense for next year will be the fact that fiscal year 2010 had only two months of CyberSource with the addition -- as we move into 2011, we're obviously going to have 10 months of comparables for which there was no CyberSource. In addition, I'd be cautious about projecting personnel expense off the fourth quarter because the fourth quarter of the year is always subject to an above average number of accruals. And so the way that we try to be helpful here was to give you an operating margin based on the entire revenue for the year and to give you some guidance on where we thought marketing would come in. With regards to hiring, we do expect to be hiring next year and a disproportionate amount of that hiring to be outside the United States as we focus aggressively on growing our revenue and developing our markets outside the U.S. It's a significant component of getting that done that requires boots on the ground and we're committed to getting those boots in the countries where the opportunity is significant.\nOperator: The last question does come from Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna.\nJames Friedman: I wanted to ask about mobile payments. Joe, your commentary about mobile payments had some noticeable enthusiasm in your voice. I was wondering, without getting into the details of the financial structures in mobile payments, is Visa better off or worse off in a world with high mobile payments penetration?\nJoseph Saunders: And I would have to tell you that everything that we've done and the money that we've invested in the mobile payments would suggest to me that we're better off with that, not worse off. And I think that the other part of the answer is better or worse, it's occurring. It's going to happen. And I mean, it's incredible, the number of people in the world that own a cell phone. And I don't -- and the usage is mind blowing. And so I think that it's something that you have to be involved in, and what I'm particularly excited about is where we are in terms of putting infrastructure together that works with our Visa infrastructure. We aren't starting out by saying, why don't you just slap a sticker on a cell phone and swipe it? We have an integrated mobile network that we've been working on for a number of years. And the monetized entity that we bought that helps connect the mobile technology to the banking systems. I mean, I think we're just in a terrific position and I think it is both offensive in terms of having the ability to increase our volume and defensive in that it is with what we have, I don't think we will lose [indiscernible]. I hope that answers your question. And thank you, everybody, for attending the call.\nJack Carsky: Thank you all very much. If anybody has any follow up, please feel free to call myself or Victoria.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. The call has concluded.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.\nJack Carsky: Good afternoon, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s Fiscal Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Saunders: Thanks, Jack, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Visa once again delivered strong earnings results. Against a backdrop of a recovering global economy, we posted net operating revenues of just over $2 billion, a 23% increase over the year-ago period. Revenues were driven by double-digit growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and Visa processed transactions coming from all areas of the globe. Net income on a GAAP basis was $716 million, a 45% increase over the prior year. Overall, we more than delivered on guidance with fiscal third quarter earnings on a GAAP basis at $0.97 per diluted share, a 49% increase over the third quarter of 2009. And these figures exclude the impact from the gain from the VisaNet do Brasil sale in the prior-year period. We also successfully completed a de facto $500 million stock repurchase, while continuing to invest in new initiatives that will fuel our future growth. On today's call, I'm going to leave the more detailed view of our financials to Byron while I address a few items I'm sure are at the top of your mind. Let me begin by providing color on recent events that have unfolded in Washington. It's clear that the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law last week will reshape the U.S. debit landscape. However, precisely how the Wall will impact Visa's business and that of our financial institution clients is yet to be determined. As you may know, the Federal Reserve has embarked upon a rulemaking process to clarify the details of the legislation and how and when it will be implemented. We have an opportunity to inform their deliberations and we intend to participate in the process as a constructive voice. In parallel, we have teams at Visa focused on developing a range of business strategies that will enable us to compete effectively in the new environment once the details of the law become clear. So until the Fed finalizes the rules and until we finalize our mitigation response, it's not possible to specifically detail our actions. On the other hand, there are things that we do know. First, given the time frames outlined in the legislation, our business should not begin to feel the effects of the legislation until this time next year. Therefore, I do not anticipate any impact in FY '10. And looking ahead to 2011, I expect the impact will be modest and contained to our fourth fiscal quarter. With that, I feel confident reiterating our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2011 at better than 20% growth. And per past practice, we will be updating other guidance metrics for 2011 on our October call. We do know that we are working with the best set of assets in the industry. We are the lowest cost provider of debit services. We have deep debit expertise, and we have a powerful brand. We also know that debit delivers tremendous value as evidenced by the growing appetite of consumers, governments and others to use the product and by merchants who accept it. Given our continuing discussions with our clients and the preliminary business strategy options that we have already developed, I'm very confident that we will effectively adapt to the new environment and continue to lead growth in this segment of the business. And as you think about our future prospects, it's important to keep in mind that Visa has a globally diverse business. While future opportunities in the U.S. remain, our growth is increasingly likely to come from outside the U.S. borders regardless of the domestic environment. Today, our non-U.S. revenues make up approximately 40% of our business, and one of our stated 2015 goals is to generate half of our revenues from operations in the rest of the world. So when I step back and take a global view of our existing business and future opportunities, I'm reminded how strongly I feel that I would rather be Visa than anyone else in our industry. And how personally committed I am to accomplishing the goals we established at last March's Investor Day. Turning to the legal front, we have two topics to update you on. We have made progress on our ongoing engagement with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding its investigation into the payment card industry and its key players. We have been cooperating with the department to satisfy the civil investigative demand filed within late October 2008 concerning the major payment networks, rules on surcharging and merchant steering as previously reported, and in recent months, have met with the department on numerous occasions. The department has indicated that it is considering filing a civil lawsuit challenging rules prohibiting surcharging on credit and differential discount in between networks, similar to the claims that have been included within the merchant interchange litigation that\u2019s been pending since 2005. Although the outcome is uncertain at this time, we are currently engaged in constructive negotiations with the department to resolve its concerns as it relates to Visa without litigation or payment of monetary damages and in a way that proactively addresses concerns in the covered litigation. Regarding the covered litigation, it is proceeding on its normal course, and we continue to be actively involved in settlement discussions. As a reminder, this litigation is covered by our U.S. financial institutions under our Retrospective Responsibility Plan. That being said, I remain highly confident in Visa's strategic plan introduced earlier this year, which will continue to guide our priorities, initiatives and investments over the long-term. In particular, we remain intensely focused on innovation, which is critical to accelerating growth and further diversifying our revenue. To that end, Visa completed the acquisition of CyberSource right on schedule. CyberSource enables us to expand our capabilities and competitive position in e-commerce, one of the fastest-growing segments of the payment industry. Not only do they possess approximately 25% of all e-commerce dollars transacted in the U.S. today, there is also tremendous opportunity for us to expand CyberSource globally, winning the new customers and the potential to increase revenues from international markets. We look forward to commenting on our joint performance in the quarters to come. Another innovation priority for Visa is mobile payments. And on that front, among other mobile initiatives, we built upon our existing relationship with Monetize by establishing a joint venture to provide financial institutions and mobile network operators in India, with a technology platform that enables them to offer a range of mobile financial services to consumers. Additionally in May, we were selected by the State Bank of India to execute a joint venture in India in partnership with Elavon to help drive the growth of digital currency in this important emerging economy by increasing acceptance and acquiring services. We also continued to successfully win new contracts and expand our relationships with issuers, merchants and governments around the globe. For instance, we just signed a five-year credit and debit deal with Tedesco, one of our most important partners in Brazil. It is the largest contract we have ever closed in our Latin-American region. And finally, I'm pleased we were able to continue delivering on our strategy to return excess cash to our shareholders in the third quarter via the funding of our litigation escrow, which has the same effect as a $500 million share repurchase. This brought our fiscal year-to-date share repurchase total to almost $1.2 billion, and we'll continue to be opportunistic in this regard over the next quarter. Let me now turn the call over to Byron to take you through the details of our financial results, and I'll be back to wrap up.\nByron Pollitt: Thank you, Joe. Let me start with the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter, followed by the global payment volume trends for the June quarter as well as payment and transaction results for July. I will then conclude with updates on our Q4 and full year guidance. Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars, rose to 13% from a positive 8% in the December period. We witnessed meaningful growth in every region of the globe. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 13% in the March quarter, up from 7% in the December quarter. Debit continued its strong recent trend, delivering 21% growth compared to 15% growth in the December quarter. Credit accelerated to a positive 3% growth in the March quarter from a negative 1% rate in the December period. On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the March quarter, up from a 10% rate in the December quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy, diversified country base outside the U.S. Now turning to the metrics that drive revenue on a current basis. Global cross-border volume growth accelerated considerably in the June quarter, posting a 17% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the 12% rate in the March period. Growth in the month of June at 18% suggests that in contrast to our view a quarter ago, this is more representative of a broader, cyclical trend rather than just pent-up demand. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $11.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 14% over the similar period a year ago and on par with the 14% growth rate we saw in the March quarter. Turning to the income statement. In our fiscal third quarter, gross revenues of $2.4 billion were up 22% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenue, came in at 16%, below the prior-year level of 17% and below our expectation. The expected rate of 18% was predicated on the signing of certain contracts during the quarter, which carry a high level of one-time contra revenue incentives. While timing is still uncertain, we project these contracts will be signed in our fourth fiscal quarter, which would elevate the support and incentive line into the range of 17% to 18% of gross revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter. Net operating revenues in the quarter were just above $2 billion, a 23% increase over the operating revenues recorded for the third fiscal quarter of 2009, driven by broad-based economic recovery and secular growth. Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $873 million, up 13% over the prior-year period and reflective of accelerating payment volume growth in the quarter ending March. The growth rate for the June quarter should mirror the March quarter's results. Data processing revenue was $792 million, up 31% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth of 14% and the final quarter of previously enacted pricing action. In contrast, our final fiscal quarter will see data processing revenue driven by processed transaction growth, which will be partially offset by yield compression due to two factors. First, recent contract wins and conversions. And second, more clients exceeding volume thresholds which qualify them for lower prices. International transaction revenues were up a solid 25% to $574 million due to continuing improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the third fiscal quarter was a positive 1% as a result of continued currency volatility, combined with our hedging activity. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect the foreign exchange impact on revenue growth to be slightly positive. Our operating margin was 56%, in line with our guidance of mid- to high 50s. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $892 million representing a year-over-year increase of $68 million or 8%, driven by anticipated increases in marketing and advertising spend related to the FIFA World Cup and continued investment in growth initiative. Our expectation continues to be that expenses for the full year will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis, including about $15 million in CyberSource-related acquisition costs, but excluding any CyberSource operating expenses incurred subsequent to the acquisition on July 21. On a sequential quarter basis, we saw moderately higher expenses in marketing and advertising given our higher spending on the FIFA World Cup event. We also saw higher professional fee expenses as a result of costs associated with the CyberSource transaction and higher investment in product initiatives and IT infrastructure upgrades. We expect to see a further sequential increase in professional fees in the fourth fiscal quarter as a result of closing and integration costs associated with the CyberSource transaction and continued investment in product and infrastructure. Capital expenditures were $65 million in the quarter and $144 million year-to-date, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. Based on higher levels of spend in the third and fourth fiscal quarters for all of fiscal 2010, we now expect capital expenditures to be moderately higher than $200 million. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $7.4 billion. Of this total, $2 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement with $1.5 billion that is currently uncommitted. As you recall, in May, we placed $500 million into the escrow account, which had the effect of a 6.7 million share buyback. As of the end of fiscal Q3, Visa's outstanding share count is now 731 million on an as-converted basis. Now let me comment on the June quarter's payment volume data and our early read on July. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year. Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars, rose to 14% from 13% in the March quarter. We experienced meaningful growth in every one of our global regions. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 14% in the June quarter, up slightly from 13% in the March quarter. Debit continued its strong recent trend, delivering 21% growth, same as the March quarter. Credit accelerated to 6% growth in the June quarter from 3% in the March period. More recently, through the 21st of July, U.S. payment volume grew at 13%, one percentage point below the June quarter rate, but one percentage point higher than the month of June growth rate of 12%. Further deconstructed, debit grew at 20%, while credit grew at 6%. On a constant-dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the June quarter same as the March quarter. These results recognize a continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. As mentioned earlier, global cross-border volume grew at 17% in the June quarter on a constant dollar basis. Growth in the month of June was a strong 18%. July cross-border volume growth on a constant basis sustained the strong rate we saw in June, posting an 18% rate of growth through the 21st of the month. Processed transactions through the 21st grew at 15% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 14% growth posted for the third fiscal quarter, and up slightly from the 13% growth rate delivered in the month of June. Now let me comment on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impact on our full year guidance. We continue to be comfortable with a net revenue growth target at the high end of the 11% to 15% range. Despite our year-to-date growth of 18%, we anticipate a couple of dynamics in the fourth quarter. First, the data processing fee increase we implemented in July 2009 lapped in June 2010. This will contribute to a significantly lower growth rate in fiscal Q4 for reasons described earlier. Second, we expect volume and support incentives to increase in the fourth quarter for two reasons: First, higher earn-out rates tied to the higher payment volumes we're experiencing. And second, as mentioned earlier, we anticipate signing certain contracts, which, if concluded, would result in an incentive level as a percent of gross revenue of around 18%. This in turn would result in a full year rate at the high end of our previously stated range of 16% to 17%. Our expectation for full year 2010 operating margin remains in the mid- to high 50s. Increased marketing, advertising and new initiative spending in the second half combined with the CyberSource transaction expenses, offset the higher margin we reported early in the year. We are narrowing our guidance for our full fiscal year 2010 tax rate to a range of 37% to 38%, in spite of the year to date run rate of approximately 36%. This refinement reflects an anticipated increase in our effective tax rate in Q4 due to the impact of the CyberSource transaction, the true-up of our state tax rate and the related adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities recorded as a part of our October 2007 reorganization. Taken together, we anticipate that these factors will cause our fiscal fourth quarter effective tax rate to be closer to 40%. The full year 2010 tax rate keeps us on track to reduce Visa's effective rate. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis, excluding the VisaNet Brasil gain, and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%. Both years include the addition of CyberSource. Regarding the CyberSource impact on fiscal 2010 earnings, we expect the Q4 impact on EPS to be $0.03 to $0.04, of which approximately $0.01 is from transaction costs and is already included in our full year operating expense guidance and an additional $0.02 to $0.03 from combined operations largely driven by the amortization of intangible assets arising from the transaction\u2019s purchase accounting. We still expect this transaction to be slightly dilutive in fiscal year 2011. Turning to capital expenditures, we are adjusting our expectation around CapEx to be moderately higher than $200 million. And lastly, our projection of free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million prepayment we made on the previously settled retailers litigation, but before the $2 billion spent on the CyberSource acquisition. That concludes my comments. So I'll turn the call back over to Joe.\nJoseph Saunders: Thanks, Byron. In summary, I want to underscore my confidence in Visa's future and our ability to drive continued growth both in the United States and internationally. Visa remains at the forefront of this highly competitive, dynamic industry after more than 50 years in the business because we have a track record of innovating, adapting and successfully navigating challenges. And we will continue to take concrete steps to achieve our strategic objectives and secure our long-term growth to the benefit of Visa's shareholders and clients. This past quarter was a great example of executing on those goals. With that, I'll open the floor to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julio Quinteros, Goldman Sachs.\nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Real quickly, looking at both the gross revenue yield and the net revenue yield in your model, seeing some pretty decent uptick there. Kind of taking some of the commentary about the higher rebates and thinking about some of the puts and takes in pricing as we think about the forward quarters. Can you talk specifically about the pricing levers that you guys would have left in the forward quarters as we roll into fiscal 2011 both in the U.S. versus the rest of the world, please?\nByron Pollitt: Julio, Byron. So we're just going to respond to the pricing opportunities pretty much what we have said before that we have behind us most of the mark-to-market opportunities, which were more domestic in nature going forward, more of the opportunity that we have. First of all, more modest. Second, it is much more outside the United States. So much more of a rest of world opportunity. We are still in the process of standardizing practices so opportunities still remain. And then of course, with the unfolding legislation that we have in the United States. Once the legislation is clarified, then that will give us an opportunity to relook at the services that we provide that deliver value and look for opportunities to reprice consistent with the strategies that we will be pursuing in the new environment going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bob Napoli, Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: Joe, the payment system is somewhat of a mess, I guess. If you look at the changes, some of the big ones, banks less than $10 billion are excluded from the bill. Prepaid cards are excluded. You have this debit exclusivity. As you look at some of those challenges in managing that system, do you think it is -- how do you think that will work? I mean, is it too early to tell? Do you think it's feasible that these smaller banks get excluded in practice? And what are your thoughts around how banks will respond with prepaid cards?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, look, the answer is that I can't specifically answer that question until I get a little bit more clarity in the rulemaking process from the Fed. Now we\u2019ll, as I mentioned, be a positive part of that, but until that happens, it's a little difficult to ascertain. Now we maintain through the process that having a dual-price structure would be difficult, if not impossible, and nothing has happened that particularly changes my mind about that. The solution to the issue does not lie with Visa alone. It lies with several different parties in the chain, as you know, so it's not totally in our control. We will, of course, do everything in our power to adhere to the law of the land. And we're just going to have to see what kind of effort that takes and how other people respond to the same challenge.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Hochstim, Buckingham Research Group.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yes, I wondered could you give us a sense of how much customer account conversions might have contributed to the debit growth in the U.S. and processed transactions, are they meaningful? Senator Durbin's got some new credit card interchange proposal relating to government cards. I wonder if you have any color on that.\nByron Pollitt: On the first part, the conversions did contribute, but very, very, modestly, not material. And on the second part of the question...\nJoseph Saunders: As it relates to the proposals that Durbin just made, it would have very little effect on interchange in total. I mean, it's de minimis.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Smith from Duncan-Williams.\nGreg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.: You guys made some changes with regards to the dynamic currency conversion outside the U.S. Just wondering, can you give us an update there? Is that signal maybe a future additional revenue opportunity for Visa?\nJoseph Saunders: We have rules in place that govern direct currency conversion. We have some of the globe operating under those rules. Some of them have been grandfathered based on practices that existed before Visa merged. And so what we have done is put a moratorium on direct currency conversion, while we study this situation. And so in the months to come, expect to hear more from us on this subject.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang, JP Morgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I thought I\u2019d maybe ask about the share repurchases. Just your appetite, Joe, to buy back stock given what's going on. I guess as a follow-up, how much freedom do you have to do something like the $500 million synthetic repurchase that you guys just did?\nJoseph Saunders: I'm going to turn that over to Byron. There is an authorization existing.\nByron Pollitt: So the appetite remains. So I'll just use this as an opportunity to once again reaffirm that management's intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and repurchases. Of the outstanding authorizations that we have today, we have $336 million unutilized, and we will be looking for opportunistic moments over the next several months to use that authorization. And then, of course, we are never hesitant at future board meetings to ask for additional authorization.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Frisch, Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Frisch - Morgan Stanley: The next 12 to 18 months is a more uncertain landscape than when you reported your March quarter. And I just wanted to ask two questions about that uncertainty, whether it be legislative- or macro-related. One, has it impacted your plans at all to invest capital in the growth initiatives you discussed at your Analyst Day? Have any of those plans been altered? And two, Joe, you reiterated your 20% EPS growth for next year. Have you incorporated additional scenarios and contingency planning and so forth, and how firm is that guide?\nJoseph Saunders: At this time I don't have any reason to back off anything we talked about in our March Investor Day. We're moving forward with all of those strategic notions. As it relates to reaffirming the guidance, we're reaffirming the guidance so I mean I think that, that speaks for itself. And we didn't do it without thinking about it. I mean, we didn't do it without looking at what was going on in the economy. We didn't do it without understanding what was happening legislatively. We just didn't do it without being cautious and prudent and thoughtful, and so we're confident that we'll deliver.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Kissane, Bank of America.\nJames Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch: Joe, can you give us a little more color on the DoJ situation? I mean that came across pretty complex, I know it\u2019s legalese. But is it a surcharge issue, a credit interchange issue, or just maybe big picture color?\nJoseph Saunders: There is not an interchange issue with the DOJ. The primary issue is their concern over surcharging, and it relates to credit cards. This is a dialogue that we've had with them for a lengthy period of time. The current conversations are dovetailing with the litigation conversation. So we're in the midst of -- so I think this is just part of the same fabric, and I think that things are moving in a direction that we have anticipated and so we're not unhappy with where we are.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois, Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Bernstein Research: Not that you want to talk any more about the Durbin amendment, but if multiple PIN debit brands are required on all U.S. debit cards, and there are no restrictions on merchants routing, do you think your Interlink business could boost some share or experience some pricing pressure? And then, I guess, a part B to that, have you changed anything in your customer-engagement strategies in light of the Durbin amendment?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, you made some specific statements as to what the implications of the amendment are, and I'm not as certain as you are about how those are going to manifest themselves. And we've already had, of course, had dialogue with our clients. We've had an initial dialogue with the Fed. We\u2019ve continued to pursue it congressionally as it relates to intent. We've looked at who we are. We looked at what we do. We look at what value we bring, and we have a number of different ways to react to the situation that you're referring to. And I think that when everything is said and done, and all the smoke is cleared that we'll continue to do well. What that specifically means, I can't speak to right now. And as it specifically relates to Interlink, it may or may not affect Interlink per se, but that's just part of our business. I mean we have a PIN Debit business and a Signature Debit business. And maybe there's less distinction between the two, maybe there isn't. I think we'll have to wait and see. But either way, we're prepared.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg, UBS.\nJason Kupferberg - UBS Investment Bank: I was hoping you could compare for us your conviction level, if you will, now versus a quarter ago. Just in terms of this volume recovery in your business being sustainable and not just mostly a function of easy year-over-year comps. I think you've made it pretty clear on the cross-border side that you think it's more than just pent-up demand. But putting cross-border aside, we\u2019d just love to get a qualitative sense on how you're leaning now versus a quarter ago in terms of sustainability?\nByron Pollitt: So let me take that one, Jason. Let me share a few more granular numbers to give a little bit of perspective. I would say overall, our view is that we are in recovery. What we're seeing on balance suggests maybe a lower probability of a double dip than what we might have suspected a quarter ago. But we also believe that the recovery is going to be protracted. When you look at it on a month-by-month basis, the numbers are certainly good, given the prior-year comps. But you're going to have some bumps along the way, and hence, the notion of a recovery without turbulence, our guess is it's not in the cards. Let me give you a quick snapshot of what we saw the last several months for the U.S. This is all-in payment volume. Let's start with March. March payment volume increased 16% then went to 15% in April, then it went to 15% in May. Then it dropped to 12% in June, still a good number, but a little turbulent. And July, through the 21st of July, it's positive 13%. So all suggesting recovery. But whether it will be consistently upwards sustaining and accelerating, hard to call.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Maurer, CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: Regarding your marketing budget, you've guided to under $1 billion. The number hasn't strayed that far from there over the last few years. I was wondering if you view that number as enough to sustain you going forward and you probably just move marketing regionally as you have to. But that the $1 billion number seems like a reasonable target going forward.\nJoseph Saunders: Let me offer the initial response. We will look to give you an update on annual guidance going forward at the next earnings call. That's our custom, to guide at the beginning of the year. It has been around $1 billion for the last couple of years. And in light of the unfolding recovery in the economy, where we stand in the environment, hopefully clarified by then in the U.S., we'll take a very hard look at where the marketing dollars yield the most return. And then, on a bottoms-up basis come to a total and give you some reference points at the next earnings call.\nOperator: The next question comes from Don Vendetti [ph 57:17], Citigroup.\nUnidentified Analyst: Joe, certainly understandable that there's going to be some time before you can really assess the risk around Durban and debit. But is there any scenario, I mean are we talking about just arrested growth rates or is there a scenario where you could have to reduce your fees to the banks? And are you feeling any pressure from the banks as they look at their different scenarios?\nJoseph Saunders: I don't think that there's any pressure that we're feeling right now that we haven't been feeling for quite some time. I think we've been in a competitive environment for a while. This probably exacerbates it to a certain extent. I obviously can\u2019t get into talking about any of our contracts specifically. I think that we have thoughtfully taken our relationship with our clients into consideration in giving you our current guidance. And beyond that, there isn't much I can say. I mean, look, there are different things that can happen as a result of the Financial Services Act, and we'll have to see what that means. I really don't believe in my heart of hearts that it's going to stop the electronic payments from growing in the United States. And I really believe that Visa will be a significant part of that in the future as we are now. What that means, what form that takes, how that changes our business model is not -- I'm just not able to specify that at this particular point in time. But you should take some confidence in knowing that we are paying attention. We\u2019re not just sitting on our hands waiting for something to happen. We are aware of the different directions that things can go and we are aware that different things will come into play. But to specify that publicly right now is just not possible.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom McCrohan with Janney.\nThomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Yes, two quick questions on the growth in payment transactions. They grew $1 billion sequentially primarily due the U.S. debit cards. If it was not new clients converting such as WaMu, what drove the really strong sequential growth in U.S. debit cards?\nJoseph Saunders: Some of it was WaMu. I mean some of it was WaMu and some of it was -- we did have some conversions. And I think that Chase started putting out Visa cards last July and started their conversions in January and the conversions are still going on and will go on through the end of the year.\nByron Pollitt: I would just add to that, that in addition to the conversions, we are perhaps seeing a build in recovery. Remember, we are comping off of a pretty low volume last year that is -- relatively, we had actually negative-payment-volume growth last year. So we are ramping up. And then, in addition to that, you have your conversions that are contributing to that. So it is an underlying resurgence in the business. Consumers spend within that. And then on top of that, you have an extra increment associated with the wins that we've experienced and conversion.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Brendler, Stifel, Nicolaus [Stifel Financial Corp.]\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Lots of questions on Durbin. I have one as well. The one area that I can\u2019t put my hands around it and I was hoping, Joe, you could give me some color commentary since you\u2019ve been in the business for so long. Is the prospect of merchant discounting, is that a significant risk? It seems like that could be a pretty big impact on payments volumes, discounting for cash or PIN debits becomes a big part of U.S. payment system. Do you have any color you can provide on just how big that risk is?\nJoseph Saunders: We've allowed discounting for a number of years. The definition of how someone can discount has been modestly expanded. But frankly, we've never looked at that as a significant risk. I mean, we've always been okay with the notion of discount. We've had a little bit more trepidation as it relates to surcharging, but not at this time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Willi, Wells Fargo.\nTimothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Question about CyberSource and maybe the longer-term implications of the mobile in the commerce world. Is there anything in that business model or as you envision those markets developing both domestically and overseas that would have any kind of secular shift on the revenue yield in terms of purchase volume or revenue per transaction? Again, as you advance that strategy which I think you said CyberSource is pretty critical to?\nJoseph Saunders: We have not looked at it so much from the yield side as just the raw, secular revenue opportunity. And you particularly singled out mobile as opposed to the e-commerce space, which is one of the, if not our fastest-growing source of transactions, many of which are cross-border. So from that standpoint on the transaction basis to the extent that there is a disproportionate number of cross-border transactions within the e-commerce space that we're seeking, yes, the yields could be significantly higher. But you focused specifically on mobile, and in our view, there are going to be, particularly in the developing and emerging countries where a U.S.-type infrastructure is simply not in the cards, there is a significant opportunity for mobile to be the plastic of the emerging and developing world. India, it is why we are so focused on building out our business in India because mobile is such a good match with the infrastructure that will be cost effective for that enormous country.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: Byron, could you put a little bit of an order of magnitude around compression in the data processing field in the fourth quarter? And then, also a little bit of a decline in the service fee yield this quarter. That's been ongoing. Could you comment just on what's going on there?\nByron Pollitt: So let me talk about the data processing first. I think the biggest dynamic, as you transition from three to four in terms of quarters, is that we've lapped the pricing action that we took last year. That's by far and away, the single, largest dynamic. And from a modeling perspective, the way you might think about looking at data processing as I described in my opening remarks is that if you began with the underlying transaction growth, Visa processed transactions are the primary driver of data processing. And then, basically what we're saying is that as volume is building, a lot of that volume is going to clients that are already in our lowest pricing tier, or we're putting more of the volume in lower pricing tiers. And that's a natural outgrowth of the healthy growth in the business and what happens when you have increasing economies of scale. We share that with our clients. And so that's basically the dynamic on the data processing side. On service fees, it's a much more complicated dynamic. I wouldn't read too much into month-to-month shifts. And so, hard to comment surgically on that. I would just say, there's no material callout today on service-fee trending.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Parker, Lazard Capital Markets.\nDavid Parker - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: During the quarter, you released a new e-commerce product, Payclick, in Australia that stacks up better with PayPal than Right-Click did. Can you just comment on your strategy with that product and how you might use the CyberSource acquisition to get closer to the merchant and penetrate that channel?\nJoseph Saunders: On Payclick, literally in June, we just launched a pilot. And as you pointed out, that was done in Australia. So it is very, very early days in that. We'll have much more to talk about that going forward, but early days on that. Pilot just underway. Stay tuned.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: I just have a quick question on pricing changes. I seem to recall there was a pricing change that would kick in, in July. One, I wanted to make sure that was the case. And two, just want to make sure that was incorporated into the revenue guidance.\nJoseph Saunders: The answer is, there was a pricing action that took effect in July. But because of the quarter lag in our reporting of service fees, that won't actually show up until the first fiscal quarter of next year. And on the second part of your question, it is incorporated in the guidance that we have given for fiscal year 2011.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Mammone, Deutsche Bank.\nChristopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank AG: I guess the one area on revenues that sort of misses the mark as far as where we were modeling with international transaction fees, especially given the easy comp with last year's. Anything to call out there? And then as a follow up just on the incentive line, were there any recurring themes on why a lot of these deals got pushed out to beyond the third quarter? And I guess, what are the chances that you don't get some of those signed and sealed until fiscal '11?\nJoseph Saunders: No call out on the international. It is somewhat impacted by currency, but basically, we just outperformed during the quarter. And this has been a significant upside for us during the year. Just to give you all a little color, in month of April in constant dollars, cross-border volume was up 15; May, 19; June, 18; July through the first 21 days, 18, and that compares to the first month of the fiscal year when cross-border was zero. So this has been a very good story for us through the course of the year. With regards to timing of contracts, this is always hard. It's just hard to pick the quarter. And so nothing to read into this other than the pace has probably slowed a bit because with our U.S. banks given the dramatic attention that Washington has commanded over the last two quarters. Other than that, I would say nothing in particular to read into it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bruce Harting, Barclays Capital.\nBruce Harting - Barclays Capital: It's hard to differentiate over these last few months of underperformance between fears of double-dip or the things that have happened in the legislation. But I would just be curious to your view on the feedback you get, what is weighing more heavily on the stock? Is it implications from the Durbin amendment or just fears of a double-dip? But Joe, your comment that Durbin won't impact \u2019til this time next year, so therefore, might have impact on fourth quarter next year. Thus, 20% EPS growth is still in place is very reassuring new guidance today, which thank you. But in the past, the President of Australia suggested there wouldn't be an impact on Visa. So I\u2019m just wondering are you implying that there may be -- is that a change in the view from Australia that the Durbin amendment may indeed impact you? And is it too simplistic to simply divide -- to get to per card debit spend, I get about $2,500, if I just take total cards by annual debit spend. Couldn't the banks simply, that's about $25 a year of income at a 1% average debit fee, couldn\u2019t the banks simply replace that with some other form of fee in their bundled checking account structure and recoup what they lose in debit interchange? So sort of another reason I'm wondering why it seems like you might suggest post 2011, there could be an impact on the fees you receive.\nJoseph Saunders: I don't know that I indicated that I thought that there was going to be an impact one way or the other. I just said that I have clarity as it relates to where we are for the last quarter of this year and next year. I also said I wasn't sure of all the implications. And I wasn't sure of exactly how we would position ourselves in response to some of the implications. But if I indicated to you that I thought there was a storm on the horizon, I didn't mean to. I'm just not going beyond 2011 at this particular juncture. As it relates to your question about our stock, you guys have more to say about that than I do. You tell me what happened. That's not my job. My job is to tell you who we are, how we're performing and how we see our performance in the future and that's what we're doing.\nOperator: The last question does come from Jamie Friedman, Susquehanna.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Just as we tune the model, Byron, the personnel expenses were somewhat lower than what we had modeled, but the professional consulting fees were higher. I realized you said the professional consulting fees were related to CyberSource. Will those sunset as we move into fiscal '11, and is the reduction in personnel expenses sustainable?\nJoseph Saunders: With regards to CyberSource, we had some impact in pro fees in the third quarter. We will have much more in the fourth because we closed out the transaction during that quarter. And so, most of the direct CyberSource cost that are specifically deal-related will hit in the fourth and, of course, will not recur. We could easily have some integration costs that will stretch over into the early part of fiscal year '11. But the CyberSource fees pretty much goes away at the end of this quarter. Personnel, we're not going to talk about that specifically. But what we will do on the next earnings call is give you a sense as to where we see revenue growth and where we see margins, operating margins, which will encompass personnel, and don't be surprised if we have a word or two on marketing.\nJack Carsky: Well, that concludes the call. Thank you, everybody, for joining us here today. If anybody has any follow-up questions, please feel free to call either Victoria or myself. Thanks, again.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. The call has concluded.

All participants are in a listen only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations.\nJack Carsky: Welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With us today are Joe Saunders, Visa\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website. With that, I\u2019ll turn over the call to Joe.\nJoseph W. Saunders: As we conclude the first half of our fiscal 2010, I\u2019m increasing optimistic that the worst of the recession is behind is because we are finally beginning to see evidence of a pickup in spending domestically and internationally. This was apparent in the results of our fiscal second quarter as strong year-over-year payments volume and revenue gains were delivered in every area of our business.  However, while we are increasingly more comfortable the economic environment in which we are operating, we remain watchful of the longer term sustainability of growth in the world economy. Earnings for our second fiscal quarter on a GAAP basis were $0.96 per diluted share, a $0.25 or 35% increase over the second quarter of 2009. Net income on a GAAP basis was $713 million, a 33% increase over the year ago period.  Net operating revenues in the quarter were just under $2 billion, a 19% increase over the year ago period as a result of stronger than anticipated payments volume, cross border volume and process transaction growth coming from all areas of the globe. Byron will get in to the details but overall we are very pleased with our results and we remain cautiously optimistic that we will continue to see solid trends going forward.  Process transaction growth continued to accelerate over the quarter ending the period at 14% on a year-over-year basis with over 10.6 billion transactions processed over Visa net. This is up from the 12% growth rate we experienced last quarter and well ahead of the same period a year ago when process transactions grew 6%.  With these trends we are increasingly optimistic that our net revenue growth will now come in at the high end of our 11% to 15% range. While we delivered 16% growth year-to-date keep in mind that we lap last year\u2019s data processing price increase at the end of the June quarter. In addition, consistent with our annual plan and guidance, we are projecting modestly higher rebates and incentives in the back half of the year. Byron will provide greater detail on this. As you know, last week we announced an agreement to acquire CyberSource. It\u2019s a strong fit with our long term strategic view of eCommerce and is complemented by its ability to deliver incremental benefits to our financial institution customers and their cardholders. While we\u2019d be happy to entertain any outstanding questions you may have at the end of this call, please keep in mind that because CyberSource shareholder approval is still pending we will not be able to go in to any more detail on the transaction than we did last week. I would refer you back to the presentation and transcript of our comments from the conference call. Additional information regarding the transaction will be available in the forth coming registration statement Form S4 which will be filed with the SEC in due course. All-in-all we continue to execute well against our business plan. Our management team remains very focused on further expanding our payments network globally by growing issuance and acceptance locations, by expanding our processing capabilities, by adapting our products and services to fit the need of individual markets and by driving transactions with effective marketing programs.  As we navigate through the current economic environment, we are generating solid earnings results and will continue to focus on returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. While we temporarily curtailed our previous announced share buyback earlier in the second quarter, it is our intention to resume share repurchases this fiscal year as conditions warrant.  With that, let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the details of our financial results and then I will back.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our fiscal second quarter and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for April. As Joe already mentioned, it was a very strong quarter with better than anticipated revenue growth. Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 3% in the September quarter to 8%.  In the US payment volume growth was a positive 7% in the December quarter up from a -1% in the September quarter. Debit continued to prove both its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 15% growth compared to 7% growth in the September quarter. Credit improved to -1% in the December quarter from a -9% in the September period.  On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 10% in the December quarter, a modest improvement over the 8% rate delivered in the September quarter. These results continue to reflect solid secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the US.  Now, turning to the metrics that drive revenue on a current basis. Globally cross border volume growth continued to improve in the March quarter posting a positive 12% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the positive 2% rate in the December period. Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled $10.6 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 14% over the similar period a year ago and up from 12% growth we saw in the December quarter. Turning to the income statement, in our fiscal second quarter gross revenues of $2.3 billion were up 20% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenues came in at 16%, up from the prior year\u2019s recession influenced level of 15% and in line with our expectations and guidance for fiscal 2010 as payment volume growth improved. Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $2 billion, a 19% increase over the operating revenues recorded for the second fiscal quarter of 2009 driven by better than anticipated global payment volume and process transaction growth in debit, in credit and cross border payments. Moving to the individual revenue line items; service revenues was $885 million up 10% over the prior year period and reflective of accelerating payment volume growth in the quarter ending December, a trend which continued through the March quarter. Data processing revenue was $728 million, up 34% over the prior year based on strong process transaction growth of 14% and the continuing effect of previously enacted pricing actions.  International transaction revenues were up a solid 22% to $545 million due to an improvement in cross border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the second fiscal quarter was a positive 2% as a result of the weakening dollar against several key currencies. While the balance of this year\u2019s revenue forecast is substantially hedged, some quarter-to-quarter volatility may be exhibited due to the timing of hedges and the underlying volatility of currencies.  Overall, for the full fiscal year, we expect the foreign exchange impact of revenue growth to be neutral to slightly positive. Our operating margin was 57% in line with our guidance of mid to high 50% range. Higher revenues in the period were offset by higher planned marketing and advertising spend in the quarter. We expect a similar dynamic in our fiscal third quarter as we ramp up ahead of the FIFA World Cup.  Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $837 million representing a year-over-year increase of $71 million or 9% driven by anticipated increases in marketing and advertising spend. Our expectation continues to be that expenses on a full year basis will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis excluding any affect from our pending CyberSource acquisition. On a sequential quarter basis, we saw moderately higher expenses in marketing and advertising as well given higher spending on the winter Olympics and upcoming World cup event. We also saw consolidated personnel expenses as we invest for future growth. Capital expenditures were $42 million in the quarter and $79 million year-to-date representing ongoing investment in technology and our newer initiatives. For fiscal 2010 we expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million.  Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter in strong shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available for sale investments of $6.3 billion. Of this total $1.6 billion is restricted cash which represents amounts sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement with $1 billion that is currently uncommitted. The previously announced unlocking of 50% of the remaining locked up Class C shareholdings commenced on March 1st and as anticipated had little discernable effect on our trading activity. As of the end of March there are a total of $100 million Class C shares outstanding of which $55 million shares remain locked up.  Now, let me comment on March\u2019s payment volume data and our early read on April. Then, I\u2019ll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year. Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars rose to 13% from a positive 8% in December. We experienced meaningful growth in every one of our global regions. In the US payment volume growth was a positive 13% in the March quarter up from a positive 7% in the December quarter.  Debit continued its strong recent trend delivering a positive 21% growth compared to 15% growth in the December period. Debit, currently accounts for 57% of total US payment volume. Credit accelerated to a positive 3% growth in the March quarter from a -1% in the December period. More recently through the 21st of April, US payment volumes grew at 15%, two percentage points ahead of the March quarter rate but one point lower than the month of March gross rate of 16%.  Further deconstructed debit grew at 22% while credit grew at 7%. On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the March quarter, up from a 10% rate in the December quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the US. Global cross border volume growth accelerated considerably in the March quarter hosting a 12% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the positive 2% rate in the December period.  Growth in the month of March was an unexpectedly strong 16%. In contrast to our view a quarter ago this trend appears to be more representative of a broader cyclical trend rather than just pent up demand. April cross border volume growth on a constant basis sustained the strong growth rate we saw in March posting a 17% rate of growth through the 21st of the month. Process transactions through the 21st grew at 15% over the prior year period up slightly from the 14% growth posted in the second fiscal quarter but down a point from the 16% growth rate delivered in the month of March. Now, let me comment on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impact on our full year guidance. As Joe mentioned, given our year-to-date results we are now comfortable with a net revenue growth target at the high end of the 11% to 15% range. Despite our year-to-date growth of 16%, we anticipate a couple of dynamics over the back half of the year.  First, the data processing pricing action we took in April of 2009 will lap in our June quarter making year-over-year growth comparisons in this line item less favorable in the fourth quarter. Second, consistent with our guidance, we expect rebate and incentive costs to increase moderately in the second half due to higher earn out rates tied to the higher volumes we\u2019re experiencing. Remember, as discussed at our investor day, the level of incentives tied to payment volume growth declined in fiscal year 2009 due to economic conditions.  Consistent with our internal operating plan and our guidance, the level of incentives earned will naturally rise with volume in 2010 with the financial impact weighted more to the second half of the fiscal year. In addition, we also anticipate signing several new deals, some as soon as the third quarter which may have upfront payments that are directly expensed rather than amortized resulting in some lumpiness to our quarter-to-quarter incentive levels. That said, consistent with our Q1 guidance, we are still comfortable with full year rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenue in the range of 16% to 17% potentially at the higher end. Our expectation for our full year 2010 operating margin remains in the mid to high 50s. As exhibited this quarter, increased marketing and advertising expenses as well as further investments in our numerous initiatives offset the higher margin we reported in our first fiscal quarter. We expect similar dynamics in our fiscal third and fourth quarters. We expect our full fiscal year 2010 tax rate to be in the range of 36.5% to 38.5%. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis excluding the Visa Net Brazil gain and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%. We expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million and lastly, our projection for free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion which is net of the $682 million pre-payment we made last quarter on the previous settled retailers litigation.  That concludes my comments, so I\u2019ll turn the call back to Joe.\nJoseph W. Saunders : In closing let me say it\u2019s certainly been a very busy and exciting time at Visa. We are fortunate to sit at the center of a dynamic and highly competitive industry. Not only are more consumers turning their backs on cash and checks but more government and businesses are embracing the speed, security and reliability of Visa digital currency in every part of the world. Inevitably along with our success comes increased competition from companies large and small both within and outside the United States. However, as we have done on the past, we will continue to challenge ourselves to innovative and adapt to the ever changing competitive landscape. Importantly, we are taking concrete steps to achieve our strategic objectives and secure our long term growth to the benefit of Visa shareholders and clients. We are also continuing to build our management team with key hires to lead and operationalize our activities in mobile and eCommerce. Even as we look to the future we continue to focus on the tremendous opportunities in our core business, the ongoing migration to digital currency from cash and checks. By way of example, at the end of calendar year 2009, the number of Visa debit and prepaid cards issued globally surpassed one billion for the first time in our history. This represents not only further penetration of debt globally but the underlying growth and importance of prepaid cards which are a key contributor of all of our debit business overall. In the coming weeks we will increase our marketing activation around our FIFA sponsorship in advance of this summer\u2019s World Cup. The majority of these marketing investments will be focused on increasing awareness of the benefits of debit and premium credit products with the goal of driving every day and cross border transactions. Particular emphasis will be given to markets with strong growth potential and a passion for soccer. With this, we are ready to take any questions.\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Adam Frisch \u2013 Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Frisch \u2013 Morgan Stanley: I guess I\u2019ll focus on emerging markets since CyberSource is sort of off the table for now. Turning to Brazil, two of the larger banks announced a JV this week. It certainly can be seen as threat to you but our industry contacts suggests they\u2019re going after the private label market and not your core offering. So any color you can provide there would be great and an update in other initiatives like India and Russia would also be appreciated and if you could focus on the support you\u2019re getting from the big banks and government entities in these markets that would be really helpful. \nJoseph W. Saunders : As it relates to Brazil there\u2019s not much to report beyond what you just said. Every indication that we\u2019ve had, any conversations we\u2019ve had with the individuals at those institutions would suggest exactly what you said Adam. So we don\u2019t look at this as being threatening to us certainly in the near term. As it relates to Russia, we\u2019re working well with the government and with Sharebank which is as you know the largest institution as well as other banks. As a matter of fact I signed an agreement with Sharebank while we were at the Olympics and it covered an agreement on how we were going to operate cooperatively at the Winter Olympics in Russia. Sharebank who has actually traditionally been more of a MasterCard bank than a Visa bank is fully committed to issuing only Visa cards from now through the Winter Olympics. I have nothing new to report on India other than what we\u2019ve reported up to now.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: To follow up on the answer to Adam\u2019s question is Sharebank only issuing new Visa cards or are they going to convert from MasterCard to Visa? Then my real question was just could you give us some color on what you see in the way of cross border spending improvement? And then, have you seen evidence in this last quarter of a pickup in discretionary spending in credit card? Is there faster growth in signature cards than in other credit cards?\nJoseph W. Saunders : Well, I\u2019ll answer the first part of the question which is the simple part. The answer is I don\u2019t believe that they\u2019re converting anything they have. I was speaking primarily of new issuance, although that\u2019s over a multiyear period of time. I don\u2019t know that they\u2019ll issue zero MasterCard cards but we are their principle partner by far.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : What we see on cross border is that we are seeing just strong cross border gains throughout the globe. If we were to look at cross border for the second quarter for Visa transactions in constant dollars the category was up 12%, 11% in the US, 12% rest of world. So it is a broad based recovery on cross border. Then, with regards to discretionary versus non-discretionary the mix for us for the quarter just ended in the US which is what we have real time visibility to, the mix is now a couple of percentage points higher for non-discretionary.  So in the spirit of your question, we would say that the pickup is still very much debit, very much non-discretionary but with credit starting to show some signs of life. But, even within our credit portfolio, we\u2019re finding that the mix of non-discretionary is continuing to rise, modestly but continuing to rise. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein Capital.\nRod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein Capital: It sounds like you\u2019re poised to win some new accounts. Can you give us any profile information on the types of wins you\u2019re expecting in terms of size or geography. If you can comment on the basis for how you\u2019re wining these deals. Then also related to that Byron, since you may have some unamortizable expenses attached to these wins should we expect this to be more of a new and common trend in terms of how you deal with the upfront expenses on new wins?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : Let me give you some perspective on that, when we guide at the beginning of the year and by the way let me first say that what is unfolding this year is very consistent with how we planned the year and how we guided to it. We have every year a natural deal pipeline and natural flow of deals. What\u2019s hard to predict is when those deals will actually renew or come to conclusion and it\u2019s when you actually have a signed agreement that you can then trigger the accounting.  So there is no particular call out on wins, losses, renewals here. For fiscal year 2010, this is just how the deal pipeline fell and as a result we\u2019re more second half weighted in the incentives than we would book in the first half. You will notice that we are still affirming that the level of incentives for the year are within the guidance we gave at the Q1 earnings call. With regards to amortized expense, again I would say there is no call out here that we anticipated a certain amount of incentives being expensed and what we are reporting, although second half weighted is still very much consistent with how we thought the year would unfold.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Mosche Orenbauch \u2013 Credit Suisse.\nMosche Orenbauch \u2013 Credit Suisse: Just in that same vein following up, could you talk about what perhaps percentage of the annual revenues in those contracts might be comprise? It would see that that should imply that fiscal 2011 should have some benefits relative to this year?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : We don\u2019t guide or talk about the first part of your question, we don\u2019t break that part out in any detail. But, the conclusion you\u2019re drawing is fair and I think there are two phenomena here and frankly it has something to do with the deal flow but frankly it\u2019s more about the earn outs. Fiscal 2009 was a non-normalized depressed incentive year because portfolios did not grow substantively during that year, many of them didn\u2019t grow at all.  So what you have in 2010 is the beginning of a return to our more normalized incentive level. You have growth in the portfolios, you\u2019ll notice we\u2019re now reporting year-over-year positive growth in the credit portfolios not just the debit portfolios and so what is happening is you\u2019re starting to earn a level of incentives and get back to a more normalized level which then rests the base in fiscal year \u201910 and hence you would expect, everything else being equal a more moderated level of incentives in the year that follows, a more moderated level of growth and incentives for 2011.\nJoseph W. Saunders : I think I\u2019d add that as it relates to the number of transactions that we\u2019ve consummated over the last two years, it\u2019s partially been a result of the economy and the consolidation of the banking industry and I think we\u2019re pretty much at the tail end of that right now. So I\u2019m not sure that you\u2019ll see as many deals in 2010 as you have in the last two years.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Long \u2013 William Blair.\nDavid Long \u2013 William Blair: MasterCard is increasing prices from what we hear on merchant assessments as of April 1st so my question is have you guys raised merchant assessment pricing as well? Then also as a follow up, are there any other pricing increases that we should be thinking about here for your fiscal third quarter?\nJoseph W. Saunders : Well we\u2019ve already announced an increase in our acquirers fees similar to the one that MasterCard did and ours is effective in July. But, because of the way we book our services fees won\u2019t show up in our revenues until our first fiscal quarter which would be the October quarter.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan: I wanted to ask about the cross border revenue which was stronger than we expected. The difference between the 22% in cross border revenue versus the 19% reported volume, Byron is the delta there pricing or did mix continue to the spread widening out there? Do you follow my question?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : We don\u2019t hedge volumes but we hedge revenue so there\u2019s no real call out here. With regards to the international it\u2019s tracking pretty close but it will always have several \u2013 I mean it would not be unusual to have several points of difference plus or minus.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities.\nJason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities: I just wanted to follow up on a comment you had made at the analyst meeting about seeing a narrowing of the traditional GAAP between PIN and sig debt interchange rates. Can you give us an update on what the impetuous is for this movement? And, does it also apply to your network fees or is it really just on the interchange side? Is the goal here to more or less keep the average interchange rate about the same just by tweaking PIN up and sig debit down?\nJoseph W. Saunders : Well there are parts of that question that I can answer and parts of it that I can\u2019t and parts of it that I shouldn\u2019t. What I would say to you is that I don\u2019t think the trend from signature to PIN is any much different than it\u2019s been for quite a while and while the PIN volume has grown, so has the signature volume and the signature volume is considerably more than the PIN volume. It has always been a fact that a merchant can use PIN to any extent that they want. If the merchant wants to put PIN terminals in then they are more than welcome to do so. So, what\u2019s going on isn\u2019t in my opinion or from what we can see much different than what\u2019s been going on for quite some time. By the way which means that it isn\u2019t narrowing anywhere near as rapidly as your questions would suggest.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank. \nChristopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank:  I guess a similar question to Tien-Tsin\u2019s. Just could you go in to more color on the service revenue fee growth? It looks like service revenue fees lacked your payment volume growth which is a reversal of the trend at least from the past four quarters. \nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : With regard to service fees again, I think what we report on service fees on volumes is unhedged so it is a gross number, nominal, unhedged. When we report it in our financial statements, it is hedged and so there is always going to be a delta with regards to that. Now, having said that, I wouldn\u2019t get overly concerned about an individually quarter, you ought to be looking at it over several quarters because there will be ins and outs for the quarter. Having said all of that, there is always a degree of variance that will occur simply because there is a difference in mix. We have one level of service fee yield in the United States which is the single largest source of service fees. As you move outside the United States we have very different mix profiles so it actually does matter from which geographies the stronger growth rates are coming because if the yield is higher in the faster growing than everything else being equal we\u2019ll have service fee revenues growing faster than payment volume. But, if it\u2019s coming from areas that have lower yields on service fees, then we\u2019ll have the opposite. Then of course, there is a difference between the mix of credit and debit. Credit carries on balance higher service fee yields than debit. Then within debit, signature carries a different service field yield signature debit than PIN debit. So in short there are quite a few factors that go in to the actual translations of payment volume in to revenue and what you see is the outcome of all of those in a given quarter. All-in-all we feel it is a pretty healthy growth rate and is growing at a rate that is frankly, somewhat above our expectations at the beginning of the year.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.\nJulio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Byron can I just stay on that same point and just add another quick question on that delta card services fees. How much of that, if any, is attributable to tiering? In other words people moving so the volume is coming back faster and some of the tier pricing that you would see maybe even a merchant mix situation? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense if there\u2019s some of that that could also be another factor to kind of contemplate in the delta there?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : I think the answer that I gave earlier, Julio there are a multitude of factors. I would say that the factor that you just described has very little to do with the calculation. The added concentration of payment volume would be much more a driver than tearing. \nJoseph W. Saunders : I think the short answer to everything that Byron has said is that nothing has essentially changed in the way that we do business or the way we generate revenue or what our yields are. I think that there will be some anomalies on a quarter-to-quarter basis but as he said earlier, look at the year, look at several quarters and you\u2019re not going to see any significant change. So there\u2019s nothing going on that we\u2019re aware of and we\u2019ve looked at it pretty carefully that is significantly changing or that you have to think of as being different than it has in the past.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Byron I was just wondering if you can talk about that personnel line? You mentioned some reinvestment there and I was just wondering how we should think about it on an ongoing basis? Maybe if you could split out the investment spend portion versus the core number there. The second question was just to your comments that the rebound in volume seems to be related to a broader cyclical trend versus pent up demand. I was wondering if you could just maybe talk about the specific items that kind of lead you to believe that that is the case?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : On the personnel line, I think just keep in mind that we are coming off a year, namely 2009 where we had a combination of a very uncertain economic environment where it made sense to put a very close watch on expenses. At the same time we were completing the rationalization of expenses associated with the merging of the various Visa companies at the time of the IPO. So at the same time we were then, as we completed the rationalization we were then waiting for the right time to really start gearing up and recognizing that we have a lot of secular growth to capture.  That means we need people and more people on the ground, in countries, calling and servicing clients and that it\u2019s time for us to start ramping that up. We don\u2019t have a specific call out or breakout on the personnel but the notion here is it is time to start investing in our cross structure to support the growth in revenue and capturing the secular. It\u2019s not a heavy investment because we are leveraging our platforms but it is time to start growing that line which is what you\u2019re beginning to see. With regards to the rebound, we\u2019re just remaining cautious on this front. There are very mixed views from an economic standpoint as to whether or not what we\u2019re seeing in today\u2019s economy even globally is supported by strong fundamentals. But, there is no denying as I referenced on the cross border transactions, that we are in an environment where the world is traveling again. I say the world, we don\u2019t have Europe but it seems everyone else is traveling and we\u2019re starting to see a return to growth in the credit portfolios not just the debit. When we say positive growth in the credit portfolio, that\u2019s a global comment. We\u2019re seeing positive growth in our portfolios, both debit and credit in the United States and across the globe. Whether that will be sustained or at what level remains to be seen but back in December and January it was just hard to know whether, particularly on the cross border front whether we were seeing pent up demand. Well, here we are now in March and we\u2019re continuing to see very strong increases year-over-year on cross border.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Craig Maurer \u2013 CLSA.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 CLSA: I hate to go back to Chris\u2019 question but I just want to be sure that none of the weakness we saw on the yield was driven by the JP Morgan and Washington Mutual resigning and possible concessions there? As a follow up, if you can comment on the composition of the rebound in US credit spending, with American Express we saw pretty extraordinary growth rates out of the co-brand portfolio and I was wondering if you were seeing a similar trend between that and our normal non co-branded cards?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : As Joe said, in terms of however you look at it yield, growth rate, we are not seeing any material change in our yield environment for the yields that have been done over the past year. It\u2019s unfolding very consistently in terms of a yield standpoint with how we planned the year. What is proceeding faster is the rate of recovery. Again, I use the word recovery advisedly but I assure you we did not expect to be generating 19% revenue growth at this time almost a year ago when we were assembling budgets. With regards to credit portfolio, I\u2019m afraid our credit growth is being generated by categories that are a little less sexier. It is we\u2019re starting to see, as I mentioned earlier, a pick up on the credit side with regards to non-discretionary spend so it\u2019s fuel, it\u2019s discount stores, it\u2019s bill pay, it\u2019s grocery stores but what is encouraging is these are categories that are recurring and have a high degree of stability associated with them. I might also add that on the travel front, we are starting to see increases in airline and hotel year-over-year. But, what\u2019s really driving the gate is the earlier [inaudible] I mentioned.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan Keegan.\nRobert Dodd \u2013 Morgan Keegan: A bit of a broader question if I can, on advertising, I know we\u2019ve got the Winter Olympics and the World Cup this year, we\u2019ve got the Rugby World Cup next year, do you have a number obviously to be able to be premium partners in the sponsorship department? Is it the plan to try and grow that number of sponsors at the high end or are you happy with where you stand with the particular portfolio of relationships you have right now?\nJoseph W. Saunders : We actually have reduced the number of sponsorships we have over the last couple of years and our primary focus is on the Olympics, FIFA and the NFL. Beyond that we don\u2019t have any significant or major sponsorships that we leverage our advertising against in any substantial way, nor do we intend to. I would like to go back and just clarify one thing that Byron talked about a little bit earlier just to make sure that nobody misunderstands. I think that we did see potentially a low watermark in some of our personnel line maybe in the first quarter of this year. But, let me reiterate that we are an efficient organization, we intend to be a efficient organization, we\u2019re simply refocusing resources where we think that they should be refocused and our intention would be to end the year spending less on that line than we did last year, modestly less but less nonetheless.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from James Kissane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJames Kissane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: A quick question, Joe are the signings in the back half, are these renewals or are they mostly new business? I guess going on to Byron, are the signing bonuses becoming more prevalent, especially the ones that don\u2019t have the claw backs?\nJoseph W. Saunders : I don\u2019t think so. There\u2019s a combination of things that could come together under \u2013 I mean the funny thing about this is would happily come together particularly in the third quarter. But, they\u2019re not one thing, they\u2019re a number of things and they are in a number of parts of the world. The real answer to the question is what\u2019s going on, is we continue to attract new business, better business and we continue to excel from a competitive point of view and it\u2019s very, very consistent with our plan and where we want to go and where fortunately we seem to be ending up. So it would be wrong to say that everything is something new but it would be just as wrong to say that a lot of it isn\u2019t very new. That\u2019s where we are. But you\u2019re not talking about 10%, it\u2019s crippling our revenue growth by 10% or something, you\u2019re talking about amounts of money that may amount to somewhere between 1.5% , 2% to 2.5% of our revenue growth in a particular quarter. That would be a great quarter. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Timothy Willi \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities.\nTimothy Willi \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities: A question on yield and just sort of tying it in to maybe your thoughts around pricing. I know you\u2019ve commented every quarter about what you expect there but could you talk about how you think about on a multiyear basis impacting revenue yield by value added products whether that be around pools that give consumers more security around using the card or accessibility or prompting. Is there anything there to think about around revenue yield outside of just price increases that you would highlight?\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : I would say at this point nothing to highlight. It is very clearly an objective over time to introduce more services that not only will yield more but that will differentiate Visa more relative to more alternative payment forms and of course, that is one of the strategic underpinnings of why we were interested in CyberSource which is a discussion as you know for another day.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group.\nJames Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group: I wanted to ask about the prepaid and Joe, thanks for sharing the $1 billion debit prepaid number, that was helpful. I\u2019m wondering if the growth in prepaid is noticeably different from some of your other products? And, if as we had dialoged at the analyst day, you might contemplate breaking that out over time, how significant is that for the company?\nJoseph W. Saunders : We\u2019ve never broken out the absolute significance of it but I think we suggested of the new products that we\u2019re involved in or the new initiatives that we\u2019re involved in this is the most mature. I think that we would certainly consider breaking it out as we go in to 2011.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Co.\nMoshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Co.: Can we get an update on the merchant lawsuit in terms of some of the pending deadlines? Then, maybe looking at the recent volcano eruption and in terms of can you give us a feel on whether there was an impact on cross border transaction volumes during the June quarter because of that.\nJoseph W. Saunders : I\u2019m going to let Byron start out by telling you about the volcano and then I\u2019ll comment.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : What we can say is that for about three days we saw a blip in the forest but it was not a blip of any substantive size in that if I can call it the bounce back, things seemed to have bounced back very, very quickly and so we do not expect to have any call out in the quarter associated with the volcano eruption at this time. It was an event but for revenue purposes I think for us it was a non event.\nJoseph W. Saunders : As it relates to the litigation there are motions that are pending. There is no trial date that\u2019s been set. There\u2019s a mediation that\u2019s ongoing but obviously under those circumstances I don\u2019t have anything else that I can report to you about the litigation at this time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bruce Harting \u2013 Barclays Capital.\nBruce Harting \u2013 Barclays Capital: Is there anything to read in to the 1% slide in the April volume from March? Then, is it just my imagination or are you a little skimpy on the guidance for 2011 relative to this time last year? I don\u2019t see any revenue growth guidance or volume?\nJoseph W. Saunders : Let\u2019s just level set everything, I talked earlier about the fact that we thought we\u2019d see a little bit of pullback in the second half of the year as it related to our revenue growth due to lapping the pricing increase in the fourth quarter and due to, as Byron said, the lumpiness in the incentive line. Having said that, our projections for our guidance for the rest of this year are not predicated on a continued rapid ramp up of volume.  I also mentioned earlier in my speaking points that while we\u2019re optimistic I\u2019m not betting on a continued recovery that just goes through the roof. So, that kind of sets where we are in 2010. Obviously, under those circumstances as it relates to 2011 we\u2019ve talked about the better than 20% growth in our earnings per share but I\u2019m really reluctant to try and specifically pinpoint revenue or some of the other categories until we get a little bit further in the year and I\u2019m a little bit more comfortable where the economy is and where it\u2019s going and where our volume is going. We\u2019re poised to do well if the economy does well. Our success to some extent will follow an economic recovery. We have enjoyed volume increases up to now by expanding categories and moving in to new geographies, we will continue to do that but that would obviously be enhanced by any worldwide economic recovery or economic recovery in certain pockets of the world. We\u2019re optimistic but we\u2019re not going to go overboard and I\u2019m going to continue to be reluctant to predict what\u2019s going to happen until I have some more certainty around whether it\u2019s going to happen.\nByron H. Pollitt, Jr. : I would just add to that, that by the time we give 2011 guidance we\u2019d like to be able to include CyberSource in to that guidance assuming the transaction closes in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup.\nDon Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup: Joe, in terms of the alternative payments and eCommerce are you sort of where you think you need to be with our pending acquisition in Right Click? And, how do you think you stand versus some of the other networks?\nJoseph W. Saunders : I think that our recent acquisition is a spoke in the wheel. I think it\u2019s one of the things we had wanted to do and had thought about doing as we were putting our eCommerce strategies and our strategies for growth in the future together. I think we talked about that at investor day and so what we\u2019ve just done is consistent with what we talked about but it\u2019s one part of it, it\u2019s not by any stretch of the imagination the entire answer. But, as it relates to whether I\u2019m comfortable that we\u2019re where we need to be given what we need to do, yes I am comfortable or as comfortable as one can be in a rapidly changing environment. I think Visa has done a good job over the years in doing the research and the heavy lifting and moving that is enabling us to bring products to market today. We at Visa as a public company are very fortunate as it relates to some of the things that went on in Visa the association prior to our IPO. We\u2019re the very fortunate recipients of a lot of infrastructure and a lot of effort and testing and tests in the market that are the type of experience that you can\u2019t buy, you have to experience. So I think we\u2019re prepared and I\u2019m as confident as ever that we\u2019re ready to move forward.\nJack Carsky : That concludes our call everybody. Thank you as always for joining us today. If you have any follow up questions feel free to call either Victoria or myself.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference call.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Saunders: Thank you, Jack. As we begin our new fiscal year, I am pleased to report that our first quarter results were indicative of both the continuing secular shift to electronic payments, especially debit as well as some encouraging signs in spending domestically and internationally. With that being said, and consistent with our guidance expectations, it remains difficult to foresee how global economies will perform in the coming year, so we maintain cautious optimism about Visa\u2019s results over the balance of 2010. Earnings for our first fiscal quarter on a GAAP basis were $1.02 per diluted share, a $0.28 or 38% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Net income on a GAAP basis was $763 million, a 33% increase over the year-ago period. Recall that we will no longer be providing an adjusted basis for these metrics, but will adhere to the GAAP reported numbers going forward. Net operating revenues in the quarter were just under $2 billion, a 13% increase over the year-ago period and in line with our guidance as a result of solid payment volume and cross border volume growth as well as strong process transaction growth. For the first time in our quarterly reporting, we are providing global payment volume growth in our operational performance data pack for the quarter just ended. These results which will still be recognized on a lag basis and reflected in fiscal second quarter service revenue show encouraging improvement over the fiscal first quarter.  Process transactions continue to grow from the mid to high single digit levels we saw over the course of fiscal 2009, ending the first quarter at 10.9 billion transactions, a 12% growth rate over the prior year period and up 9% from the growth reported for the fiscal fourth quarter. I am pleased that we are executing well against our business plan. As we expand our payments network, growing issuers and acceptance locations, expanding our processing capabilities and driving transactions with effective marketing programs, we are able to take full advantage of the secular trend to digital currency and grow our business. As a result even in this difficult economic environment, we are generating solid earnings and returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we repurchased $432 million of our class A shares under our previously announced $1 billion buyback plan at an average price of just under $79 a share. We will continue to execute on this buyback as conditions warrant. We also recently announced the unlocking of an additional 56 million shares of our class C stock which will allow class C shareholders, primarily our international financial institution owners the ability to further monetize their Visa investment ahead of the scheduled March 2011 unlock. This program has no dilutive effect on our earnings per share and is similar to the prior program we executed in July of last year. With that, let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the details of our financial results and then I will be back to share our views on the economic environment and our upcoming March Investor Day.\nByron Pollitt:  Thank you, Joe. As is customary, let me began with the financial highlights for our first fiscal quarter and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for January. As Joe already mentioned, it was a solid quarter with slightly higher than anticipated revenue growth and earnings growth in line with our guidance. As noted earlier, we began providing realtime payment volume statistics this quarter. However, it is important to keep in mind that for the time being, we will continue to recognize current quarter service revenues on prior quarter payment volume. While it is our ultimate intent to recognize the associated revenue on a current basis as well, that's still in the future. Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 2% in the June quarter to 3%. In the US payment volume growth was a negative 1% in the September quarter, up from a negative 3% in the June quarter. Debit again proved both its resiliency as a product, and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 7% growth compared to 5% growth in the June quarter. Credit, while still challenged, improved to a negative 9% in the September period from a negative 10% in the June period. On a constant dollar basis, rest of the world payment volume grew at 8% in the September quarter holding steady with the 8% rate delivered in the June quarter. These results reflect continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the US. Global crossborder volume growth improved in the September quarter, posting a negative 5% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 8% rate in the June period. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $10.9 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 12% over the similar period a year ago and up from 9% we saw in the September quarter. Turning to the income statement. In our first fiscal quarter, gross revenues of $2.3 billion were up 16% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenues came in at 16%, up from the prior year\u2019s depressed level of 13% and more indicative of what we can expect over the course of fiscal 2010 as payment volume growth improved versus the prior year. Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $2 billion, a 13% increase over the operating revenues reported for the first fiscal quarter of 2009. This was in line with our revenue guidance, though slightly ahead of the low end of an 11% to 15% range provided to you last quarter. The drivers were better than anticipated process transaction growth and crossborder volume as well as the continuing effect of previously disclosed pricing actions. Moving to the individual revenue line items for the quarter service revenue was $827 million, up 4% over the prior-year period and reflective of still relatively anemic payment volume growth in the quarter ending September. Data processing revenue was $765 million, up 38% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth of 12% and the continuing effect of previously enacted pricing actions. International transaction revenues were up a solid 9% to $552 million primarily due to an improvement in crossborder volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the fiscal first quarter was neutral due to the impact of our hedging activity. At this point in the fiscal calendar, the balance of year revenue forecast is substantially hedged.  Our operating margin was 62%, but benefited from a one-time reversal of $41 million in litigation reserves and from favorable timing in marketing spend. The $41 million contra-expense in the quarter is related to the previously announced pre-payment of the retailer's litigation settlement which by itself represents two full percentage points of margin and contributed a non-recurring $0.03 to the quarter's earnings per share. Total operating expenses for the first quarter was $743 million, a decline of $30 million or 4% year-over-year. These results benefited from the gain related to the retailer's litigation settlement mentioned earlier and $28 million in restructuring costs incurred in the prior year. Our expectation continues to be that expenses on a full year basis will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis. On a sequential quarter basis, we saw lower expenses in several line items including personnel, marketing and professional fees. The lower personnel spend was primarily due to lower restructuring expenses and incentive accruals in the current quarter. This quarter, we also reclassified certain contractor expenses to the personnel line that heretofore were characterized under professional and consulting fees. This reclassification was applied to each of the four quarters of fiscal 2009 and the full year 2008. We have included a pro forma reconciliation of this with our press release financials to assist you in your modeling efforts. Marketing costs were sequentially lower. For context, we intentionally curtailed some media spend in the first quarter while absorbing Winter Olympics reduction expenses in 2009 fiscal fourth quarter. Media spend will increase in the second and third quarters around the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup event, both of which are major Visa sponsorships. Even with these investments aimed at activating our global sponsorships, we continue to see full year marketing expense below $1 billion. Professional and consulting fees declined sequentially as a result of higher spending in the prior quarter, as we brought our new East Coast Data Center fully online.  Capital expenditures were $37 million in the quarter representing ongoing investment in technology and our newer initiatives. For fiscal 2010, we now expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter in strong shape with negligible debt, and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available for sale investments of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.6 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully payout the American Express settlement with $1 billion that is currently uncommitted. As we previously announced in a press release two weeks ago and as Joe mentioned earlier, we will be unlocking 50% of the remaining outstanding Class C shareholders representing 56 million shares which will further alleviate the Class C overhang as we approach the ultimate unlock date of March 25, 2011. Now let me comment on December\u2019s payment volume data and our early read on January. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year. Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 3% in September to 8%. We experienced meaningful growth in all of our global regions. In the US, payment volume growth was a positive 7% in the December quarter, up from a negative 1% in the September quarter. Debit continued to prove its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 15% growth compared to 7% growth in the September quarter. Debit currently accounts for 54% of total US payment volumes. Credit, while still challenged, rebounded to a negative 1% in the December period from a negative 9% rate in the September period. Looking to January, through the 28th of the month, US payment volume growth up 10% is above the fiscal fourth quarter rate of 7% and on par with December\u2019s month end 10% growth. On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 10% in the December quarter, up from an 8% rate in the September quarter. These results recognize continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the US. Global cross border volume growth rebounded considerably in the December quarter posting a 2% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 5% rate in the September period. Growth in the month of December was an unexpectedly strong 4%.  Whether it is representative of a broader cyclical trend or just pent-up demand remains to be determined. Having said that, January crossborder volume growth on a constant basis showed further resiliency posting a 9% rate of growth through the 28th of the month, up from the 4% rate for the month of December. Process transactions through the 28th of January grew 13% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 12% growth posted for the fiscal first quarter. Now let me comment on our expectations over the coming fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impacts on our full year guidance. Based on an encouraging first quarter, we are recasting our net revenue growth target for the year to be in the range of 11% to 15% rather than at the low end of that range. Holding to our target range recognizes that our fiscal year is just underway and global economic performance is still difficult to foresee. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis excluding the VisaNet Brazil gain and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal, better than 20%. We are raising our expectation for our full year 2010 operating margin to the mid to high 50s, up slightly from the mid 50s, we initially targeted for this year. As mentioned earlier, increased marketing and advertising expenses in the next two quarters, as well as further investments in our newer initiatives will exert a downward bias on our margin for the balance of the year. Based on a better understanding of our tax outlook, we now expect our full year 2010 tax rate to be in a range of 36.5% to 38.5% rather than the 38% to 39% range with which we began the year. Capital expenditures are now expected to be around $200 million at the low end of our initial range of $200 million to $250 million. And our projection for free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million pre-payment we made in the quarter on the previously settled retailer's litigation. That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back over to Joe.\nJoe Saunders: Thanks Bryon. At this point, I'm sure you're sensing an underlying theme of appropriate cautiousness in our comment, and you should. While there is no question that we feel positive about Visa's position in light of what is still a challenging economic picture, it's difficult to predict when a sustained recovery will be underway. As the ongoing secular shift to electronic payments continues, a significant portion of our marketing and advertising activities are squarely aimed at positively influencing that shift to Visa products. We saw a strong growth in debit with positive comparables in certain categories of spend like fuel and recurring bill pay adding to that growth. We saw a better than anticipated international and crossborder volumes, but we're not clear if those are improving volumes representing a rebound or simply pent-up demand as Byron mentioned. We believe that any recovery will take time and will likely have a few bumps along the way. A complete turnaround in the US will arguably take even longer. Things like continuing high unemployment and underemployment, high levels of consumer debt and restrained consumer confidence will keep a lid on overall spending and payments growth especially credit for the foreseeable future. So, at this point in time we are continuing to focus on the initiatives that allowed us to get through this recession up to now in good shape. Focusing on cost efficiencies and making the right investments for the future will allow us to fully take advantage of our business models as economies around the world gain ground. More importantly, it will set the stage for success over the longer term, as the payments industry continues to evolve globally. At our upcoming Investor Day in March we will be providing you with greater insights into our long-term growth strategy. Specifically we'll explore the six key elements to this strategy including our local market focus, products and services, processing, brand, clients and acceptance. And we\u2019ll discuss how the investment decisions we are making today will help us achieve our longer-term growth objectives. As part of Investor Day, various members of our management team will present on their respective areas of expertise to illustrate how the elements of our strategy tie together. We're looking forward to engaging in this strategic discussion with you, and of course we welcome your input on the agenda for the Investor Day and encourage you to reach out to our Investor Relations team on any specific areas of interest or concern you\u2019d like to see covered. With that, we're ready to take questions. Operator?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Adam Frisch for Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Frisch - Morgan Stanley:  Professional and consulting expense, Byron, you explained why it was a little bit lower year-over-year, but it\u2019s actually the one line item we'd like to see increased a lot, given that\u2019s where the bulk of the product and R&D spend is. So, what is the trend there in terms of the investment in product and R&D and would you consider breaking out those investments in a separate line item going forward, so investors can get a better feel for resource allocation?\nByron Pollitt:  Once we normalize out the professional consulting expense associated with getting the new data center open which is now fully operational and live, we should be managing that up as we continue to invest in expanding our infrastructure and capabilities as well as new product investments. With regard to breaking that out to give more visibility to the type of expense that\u2019s going against future growth, great question, we have that under consideration and we'll seriously consider that perhaps later in the year.\nJoe Saunders:  You should remember that that line item includes all of our legal expenses for litigation and we had a lot of that last year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from UBS.\nJason Kupferberg - UBS: A quick question and a clarification if I could. My question is just to what extent are you seeing issuers reengage and start promoting credit products more actively at all and how much of that activity might be directed towards the affluent end of the market. We're also hearing more about increased mailings occurring over the last two months of '09 and then my clarification is can you give a split on your US payment volumes for January between credit and debit within that plus 10%?\nJoe Saunders: I think that there is considerable interest in the higher end of the retail market. I don\u2019t think there is any question about that, and there is some evidence that there is a little bit more activity on the solicitation front, but I would say it's a way too early to say things have turned around and we're back to something that's close to what we were maybe a year and a half or two years ago.\nByron Pollitt: Let me give you a little color on US debit and credit, and give you a little bit of historical trending by month and then into January, so you can see the progress. If we were to go back to October, credit grew in the US at minus four, November minus two, and then December actually turned positive two, January month to date through the 28th positive one.  If we were to do the same chronology for debit, October debit payment volume growth for the US was positive 12, moved to positive 15 in November, positive 19 in December and it's holding it positive 19 January month to date. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.\nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs : Can you just characterize a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of the impact of the CARD Act, and what that might be doing relative to your pricing strategies or anything that you guys might be feeling as a result of the legislation at this point?\nJoe Saunders :  I think as we\u2019ve said before, the CARD Act has an indirect effect on us, but not a direct effect. You are asking a question that is difficult for me to answer. I think it would more appropriately answered by our financial institution customers. Having said that, Byron just went over the gross statistics on the credit card business compared to the debit card business and I think it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not growing at anything close to the rates that it historically has and obviously a lot of that has to do with the economy and a lot of that has to do with the rules and regulations that they operate in.\nOperator: Next question comes from Craig Maurer at CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - CLSA: You had mentioned the growth in recurring bill pay, I was wondering if you\u2019ve had any progress in terms of getting utilities to sign on for that product?\nJoe Saunders: I think we\u2019ve had a pretty consistent growth in that category over the last several years, I can\u2019t tell you exactly what percent of that category it is, it\u2019s something that you might want to follow up with Jack.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - KBW: Byron, I was wondering if you could just quantify kind of the seasonality of the marketing spend this year in terms of magnitude and just the tax rate, should we assume that we build off of that in terms of migrating lower in 2011?\nByron Pollitt: On the marketing side, the way we try to be helpful here is that the first quarter is low spending for the year. We will increase marketing spend in the second fiscal quarter, think of that as Winter Olympics driven. Then third quarter, we will be increasing marketing spend relative to the first quarter, think of that as FIFA World Cup. So the marketing spend which is under $1 billion, with the guidance for the year is much more oriented to the middle two fiscal quarters, with the first quarter probably being the lightest. If you switch to the tax rate, so we have re-guided the tax rate into a range of 36.5 to 38.5. That follows the trajectory that we outlined during our IPO presentation of ultimately aiming to be in the 35% to 36% range, so we consider that a journey. We have yet to process what the administration\u2019s recent tax proposals are and of course that guidance was not enlightened by those tax proposals. So I would say stay tuned on what 2011, 2012 and beyond will ultimately yield, but we remain on this trajectory of getting into that 35% to 36% range that we talked about from inception.\nOperator:  Next question comes from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford Bernstein: You just posted 13% revenue growth, a very strong volume growth and also improving revenue yield and we are at the beginning of what seems to be an upturn in the economy and so your current revenue growth run rate is at the midpoint of your new revenue growth guidance. I was wondering if you could just handicap or sort of talk to us about what would have to happen for your revenue growth to come in at the low end of your revenue range? Then what would have to happen to be at the high-end or even at above the upper end of your range because it seems if the cyclical trends continue just to run on their current page, you might actually be able to exceed your latest revenue guidance range or maybe I'm looking at that the wrong way, so I wonder if you could handicap that for us?\nJoe Saunders: I think that we said on a number of occasions that we're comfortable with our guidance, and we are maintaining cautious optimism. We think that we did better in the first quarter than we thought we were going to do. We don't know whether that level of activity is sustainable and I'm a little bit conservative in that. I'm not ready to predict where the economy is going and so it's hard for me to answer that question. What I can answer is given the environment that we're operating in today, we're comfortable with the guidance that we've given.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bruce Harting from Barclays Capital.\nBruce Harting - Barclays Capital: Can you just compare and contrast the credit trends in US versus rest of the world in terms of the growth rates you're seeing and then to the degree that you can give any kind of outlook to next 2011 on the expense line? Ordinarily companies with the kind of growth you're having are matching that up with some kind of expense growth, but you're able to hold the line on expense in marketing this year and still as the last question alluded to give the appearance at least through the first quarter that you're well ahead of your targets, so if you could just comment on those?\nByron Pollitt: Let me start with the credit trends. So using rest of world as the proxy, for what you are asking about, the rest of world, considered on a constant dollar basis, the growth trends in credit, credit alone, so this would exclude debit, credit alone never turned negative. It did drop from a high double-digits growth into mid single-digit growth, that\u2019s what we are looking at for the quarter just ended in December and on a slight upward trend for rest of world. We are still in that mid to upper single-digit credit growth. If you look at all products, credit plus debit, then you are right around 10% growth for the quarter just ended, and that would be the quarter just ended in December.\nOperator: Next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan: I wanted to ask about debit which accelerated more than we expected both in the US and overseas. A couple of questions there, was there anything unusual to consider like new wins cycling through, just trying to get a better sense of same-store growth? And secondly I was curious if you\u2019re seeing any signs of debit cannibalizing credit?\nJoe Saunders: Well, I don\u2019t how you define whether debit cannibalizes credit, obviously debit is growing quickly than credit, but I think that\u2019s the nature of the economic environment that we are living in. I think that the question is to what extent will the credit volume accelerate as the economy improves and I think till that happens it\u2019s going to hard to measure the balance between the two of them. I mean we obviously remain very encouraged about our debit growth, but we are frankly also encouraged with what's going on with the credit product in the world outside of United States, particularly, but we are not particularly discouraged by what's going on in the US. Was there another part of the question, I think I am missing part of the question. Did I answer your question? Okay. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital.\nDan Perlin - RBC Capital: I was wondering if you could just give us some sort of update as it pertains to kind of the enhanced check out services you guys have been talking about in the past and then the other EC initiatives, e-commerce initiatives that you have been spending a fair bit of money on? Thanks.\nJoe Saunders:  Well, I think the enhance checkout is something that we are pretty excited about and we intend to roll that out in a very big way in about six weeks. So, I think I'll leave that until our Investor Day presentation. But I will tease you by telling you we are extremely excited about it, I think it'll be a big deal. And we continue to invest in that and other electronic payment improvements, whether they are in the Internet space or the mobile space or anyone of a number of other things. Byron mentioned that probably beginning at our March Investor Day we will breakout what we are spending on what a little bit more clearly than we have up to now, but I will remind you that we have committed to spending a $150 million to $200 million on new product development this year and I think that we will get there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Kissane from Banc of America.\nJim Kissane - Banc of America: Thanks. Joe, can you comment on the competitive environment, and your recent loss of a large debit portfolio? Thanks. And maybe just to follow-up, an update on the conversion of the WaMu portfolio and the timing of the SunTrust roll off?\nJoe Saunders: I think that we've said for a long time on a lot of these calls, that you should expect it sooner or later we are going to lose a customer and that's exactly what happened. We like to believe that we are disciplined as it relates to what we are willing to do, and how far we are willing to go, and I think that this is a case in point, so I'm unhappy that we lost a customer.  We don't lose very many, we've gained a lot more than we've lost. But that being said, it's a tough competitive environment and as I have also said on a number of occasions, MasterCard is a good company. And they are just consistently getting beat [ph] on every deal that there is. As it relates to the WaMu portfolio, I think we are just beginning to see any -- we're only at the very early stages of beginning to see any volume. The conversion is going on, I think it's pretty de minimis in the numbers that you are looking after this quarter, particularly since the service revenues are lagged.  I would say as it relates to SunTrust that I don't know what their conversion schedule is, but I believe that will take a reasonable amount of time to fully divest themselves.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan from Janney.\nTom McCrohan - Janney: Joe, can you prioritize kind of your strategic initiatives beyond this year as far as how are you going to generate long term revenue growth outside of just the secular shift from cash and check to electronic payments, one of those initiatives obviously being trying to position Visa as best possible for growth outside the United States. I am just kind of wondering how you are thinking about that, because given it seems like everyone just keeps talking about the secular shift, secular shift, that\u2019s going to slow at some point and it seems like there is a lot more powerful trends outside the US, just want to see how you are thinking about that? Thanks.\nJoe Saunders: But we can ride the secular shift I think for quite a while if we did it appropriately, but you are right. I mean there is a lot more to it than that, I don\u2019t think that I could even begin to answer the question and do a justice in the amount of time that we have. But once again I will encourage you and everybody else to attend our investor conference, because I do intend and we do intend to expand a great deal on the subject and it\u2019s worth listening to and it'll take a little time, but I can assure you, if you come, the trip will be worthwhile.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Parker from Lazard.\nDavid Parker - Lazard: I was just hoping you could update us on the Canadian market, and specifically the finance ministry up there has established some current voluntary code of contact that you and others have responded to, but is that any sense for the outcome of that and has that changed your strategy or your timing for entering that market more aggressively.\nJoe Saunders:  I think that we are in a period of reflection right now and I don\u2019t think it will move quite as aggressively as we might have hoped. But having said that, these rules in general are quite acceptable to us, and I think that the one or two sticking points that will be resolved, and I think that we will proceed into the market, but I can't give you specifics or specific timing as it relates to that. I guess, I'll just have to leave you with the thought that we're still sure that we will be in the debit market in Canada at sometime in the not terribly distant future.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Tim Willi from Wells Fargo.\nTim Willi - Wells Fargo:  A question around debit, two parts, number one, were there any portfolio conversions in 1Q that helped to drive such strong growth and cards issued, it looks like it probably was? And second, just within the debit business and the strong growth in what appears to be accelerating growth, are there any strategic or product driven initiatives within Visa or the large issuers that you are aware of that could be setting the stage for more than just a cyclical rebound, but maybe a lot more life in debit market than maybe was previously thought.\nJoe Saunders:  Well, okay, to answer the first part of the question, we've looked at this quite carefully and there is no effect of adding other portfolios in our numbers in this quarter. The growth is real growth not growth because we added a customer. To answer the second part of your question, it seems to me that when I look at retail services and financial institutions that there is a more holistic customer experience type of movement that\u2019s going on. I think, it\u2019s a share of wallet movement, I think it is an effort by financial institutions to embrace individual customers over a wide array of products and making sure that these things complement each other.  So, I think you'll see things begin to happen that are a little bit different and I believe that you'll see some focus on encouraging transactions and encouraging consolidation within a financial institution. But, I am not a financial institution and I cannot speak for them, and there is a lot going on in every major financial institution, every medium sized and small financial institution in this country as a result of economy that we find ourselves in, rules and regulations that they look like. So, I would encourage you to continue to ask them the same questions and see what they say. \nOperator:  Our next question comes from Roger Smith from Macquarie.\nRoger Smith - Macquarie:  I just know that there is a number of licensing fees in the other line and I was just wondering is there something unique going on there in that quarter? And then the second part I guess is that, you did give us the trends in the US, but was there anything specific that happened in those businesses that did cause you to increase your guidance, I mean relative to what you guys had been expecting, what's changing? \nJoe Saunders:  I think that there is a little bit more pickup than we anticipated. There is clearly more pickup in the cross border volume than what we had anticipated. So, we're pleasantly surprised in that regard as it relates to your first quarter. \nByron Pollitt:  Yes, you're referring to the other revenue. There are a couple of drivers there that are worth pointing out. The first one is, we have a arrangement with many of our clients where we handle their rewards redemption and we refer to these as pass-through revenues or expenses and so, there has been a pickup in our redemptions over the past year, that was true for this quarter and that pickup is the single largest driver of the growth rate and other revenue and that comes with roughly an equal offset in expense. There is some new licensing revenue in this category and this comes from arrangements that we have entered into with the entity we referred to as VisaNet Brazil and up to the time they went public, they would pay us regular dividends. And so the dividends stopped because our share ownership was sold, but instead, we are now receiving licensing fees, and those licensing fees appear in other revenue. The dividends that we used to receive were appearing in other income. And those are the two principle drivers for that growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Dodd from Morgan Keegan.\nRobert Dodd - Morgan Keegan: Just on the pricing that you referenced to, if I remember right, you took a price increase September quarter on data processing. So seeing that flow through, should we be expecting basically lapping of that in the fourth fiscal quarter this year, a slowdown in revenue, or do you have other material pricing initiatives underway to offset some of that lapping effect?\nJoe Saunders: The one that you are talking about, we would lap in the fourth quarter. We have given guidance on what we expect pricing increases to generate this year in our current guidance. I don\u2019t think that that would cover the shortfall. We have always pointed that out. As it relates to anything else, at the point in time that we make any decision as it relates to that pricing, and whether or not it will affect our guidance, we will disclose that immediately.\nJack Carsky: Operator, at this point we probably have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Bob Napoli from Piper Jaffray.\nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: On debit, we look at some banks that put out their debit spending numbers, and your spending numbers are much higher than on debit or much higher than the banks. And I am wondering, are you seeing new customers and are community banks picking up market share? Is prepaid having a significant effect on debit and also, your international debit, I mean have there been some breakthroughs in international?\nJoe Saunders: That\u2019s a difficult question for me to answer. We can't grow any faster than our customers. I mean, whatever they grow, we grow. We don't have any volume outside that. We have a prepaid business that's doing quite well, but there is nothing about it that would shock you in our numbers right now.  I think that outside the United States, it\u2019s the secular shift and our continued success in being able to make electronic payments in a number of geographies. And Tim, other than that, I think it's the things that financial institutions are doing to encourage the usage of debit cards in the United States. And of course I shouldn't diminish our effect, the effect that we're having on moving things to electronic payments through our promotions, and our advertising in our market.\nByron Pollitt: All right, that about wraps it up.

And as always, thank you, all, for joining us today. Visa closed out fiscal 2011 with a solid fourth quarter delivering net operating revenues of $2.4 billion on a 13% increase over the same period last year.  Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.27, an increase of 34% on an adjusted basis. As a reminder, our adjusted figures exclude the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option in the prior year. Revenue gains for the quarter were driven by strong payments volume growth around the globe, strong cross-border activity and continued recovery in credit spend worldwide. Net operating revenue growth for the quarter was impacted in part by a strategic decision to increase client incentives, as Visa aggressively pursued routing decisions from U.S. merchants and acquirers. These deals, most of which are onetime in nature, were the primary reason we modestly exceeded our annual incentive guidance of 16.5%. Visa also delivered strong performance for the full fiscal year. Net operating revenue was a record $9.2 billion, a 14% increase over 2010. Adjusted net income for the full year was $3.5 billion, a 22% increase over the prior year. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $4.99, 28% ahead of last year.  While Byron will get into more specifics on fiscal 2012, we are continuing to commit to our guidance provided in July of high-single to low double-digit revenue growth and mid to high-teens earnings per share growth. This takes into account only modest of global economic growth as well as anticipated industry reaction to the debit regulation. Given our outlook for continued growth, we continued to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. During the quarter, Visa repurchased $423 million worth of our stock at an average price of $80.87. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion, bringing our current repurchase authorization to almost $1.6 billion. And as reported last week, our board raised our dividend 47% over last year's rate to $0.88 per share on an annualized basis. Visa is fundamentally committed to driving growth by expanding our core debit, credit, prepaid and commercial businesses, which offer tremendous potential to deliver near-term and long-term revenue growth and to deliver greater value to our financial institution and merchant clients. The goal is to grow the number of users, acceptance locations and ways to use Visa products. All of our priorities and investments focus on expanding that core well into the future. This includes applying both the businesses we've recently acquired, which are generating revenue growth today as discrete entities, as well as the innovative technologies we're developing in-house. Importantly, our core business is performing well today. Worldwide Visa delivered strong growth in the September quarter, with credit and debit payment volumes growing 14% and 13%, respectively. Cross-border volume also posted healthy gains, increasing 15%.  As I review highlights for the quarter, let's first turn our attention to the United States. To help drive future growth, Visa finalized several deals with financial institutions over the past quarter. These include an extension of our long-term credit and debit issuance agreement with PNC Bank and long-term brand agreements with the Independent Community Bankers Association and card services for credit unions. In all cases, I firmly believe Visa's extensive industry expertise and experience were critical differentiating factors that helped secure these important wins. We also continue to win important co-brand deals with valued partners. This includes a new agreement with Williams-Sonoma, as well as the Marathon Oil co-brand mandate, which is a conversion from one of our largest competitors. These build on our momentum from the United Continental Holdings agreements announced last quarter. On the acceptance front, our ongoing strategic initiative to expand merchant acceptance is yielding important benefits. For the 12 months ended June 30, the most recent date we have available, Visa expanded U.S. acceptance by 400,000 merchant acceptance locations. And now, we are building on that. Beginning next month, Neiman Marcus will accept Visa in all of their stores, building upon their long-standing acceptance of Visa products online. Of course, we are moving forward on several fronts to implement our evolving debit strategies for the newly regulated U.S. market. These activities are progressing well and quickly, as we address the needs of both merchants and issuers. Our first set of activities focuses on winning merchant preference.  As a reminder, U.S. debit revenue impacted by the regulation contributes approximately 20% of Visa's total revenue today. Of that, signature debit contributes more than 75% of the U.S. debit revenue, and we are confident in our ability to retain the overwhelming majority of that as we move forward in the newly regulated environment. However, to address the pockets of debit revenue at risk as a result of the regulation, particularly revenues related to PIN debit, we are moving forward quickly with a program to incent routing decisions. In fact, between the start of the fourth quarter today, Visa completed dozens of merchant deals and executed contracts with a handful of our largest acquirers.  As I noted, by expanding our incentive program to the merchant community, we increased our client incentive sign for the most recent quarter. Byron will provide additional context, but I want it to be clear that I view these merchant incentive agreements as a critical aspect of Visa's business-building strategy in this environment. These are investments that create strong and productive relationships with our merchant client.  We're also moving forward with our modified debit economics, including the implementation of our network participation fee and the reduction of variable acquiring fees on debt, Visa debit and Interlink. As stated last quarter, we believe this offers merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per-unit transaction costs. As for details, we anticipate providing the specific pricing information to merchants and acquirers in January, which will go into effect on April 1. As a result, we will begin to recognize the related revenue impact in our fiscal third quarter of 2012.  At the same time, we are intensely focused on maintaining and expanding debit issuance through a strong partnerships with financial institution client. I've been clear since the Fed debit rules were finalized, the new legal requirements will likely result in a portion of transactions being moved away from Interlink as issuers take action to comply with the regulation. Specifically, in limited cases, this may very well result in the removal of Interlink from the card and migration to a competing network. These changes to the market are incorporated in our guidance. A key part of our strategy positions Visa to compete for every transaction on a Visa-branded debit card. To that end, earlier this year, we reminded clients that Visa check cards are enabled for PIN authentication. While merchant acquirers have historically used signature authentication for check cards, in the overwhelming majority of circumstances, Visa is fully capable of facilitating both signature and PIN debit transactions over one network, VisaNet. This is an important competitive advantage and differentiator in the new environment. Bottom line. As a long-term leader in debit, I'm confident Visa offers issuers a differentiated suite of debit products, a robust processing platform and economics that will help clients optimize their growth. Turning our attention outside the United States, we are steadily expanding Visa's international business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international markets by 2015. In fact, our international businesses grew 19% in the fourth quarter, driving 65% of Visa's overall revenue growth.  Each market is distinct and requires a unique approach to drive local growth. But much like the United States, the overwhelming majority of near-term revenue growth will come from expanding Visa's core businesses, including affluent credit, debit and processing. For one example, let's turn our attention to Latin America, where our core fundamentals are incredibly strong, and Visa has increased share in each of the past 5 years, that is, bulk share versus cash and checks and share versus our traditional network competition.  And we are building on that momentum. In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bancomer to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country. In Brazil, we strengthened our partnership with Banco Rendimento to provide Visa processing services on prepaid products in the country. We are also engaged in productive discussions with other Brazilian clients and hope to soon announce some important transactions.  Our Asia Pacific region also continues to deliver very strong growth, with payments volume growing by 17% for the most recent quarter. And to drive future growth in the region, we signed several important agreements with key clients.  For example, in Australia, we secured an important agreement with Westpac Banking Group for expanded prepaid processing services. On the merchant front, we established acceptance for Visa prepaid products at Woolworths Group, the largest retailer in Australia, a critical step towards bringing prepaid into the financial mainstream in that country. Lastly, let's talk about innovation. We are aggressively stepping up investment in new technologies that will increase transactions on our core business platforms and add incremental value to the merchant community and create a new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our clients. As technology and thus the physical and digital shopping worlds converge, Visa is building its platforms in anticipation of a broad global adoption of next-generation payment technologies, including e-commerce mobile payments and information products.  Over the past 18 months, we've enhanced our position by assembling what we believe are the best assets in the business, including CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. Each of these are discrete businesses driving revenue growth today and arm Visa with best-in-class technology and capabilities to quickly bring emerging products to market. Combined with Visa technology, global reach and proven reliability and security, these new assets will enable Visa to capture significant new revenue opportunities by providing the backbone for our next-generation offerings in the U.S. and globally.  When it comes to next-generation products, everyone is talking digital wallets. As a reminder, you don't transact with a wallet, whether it's leather or digital. You transact with what's stored in that wallet. And we have spent decades successfully placing nearly 2 billion Visa cards in cardholders' wallets. And today, when most people talk about digital wallets, they're talking about NFC payment on a mobile phone, and in that regard, no company is doing more than Visa to set the stage for broad adoption. Visa's suite of wallet solutions include Click-to-buy, touch to buy and tap to buy, which embrace e-commerce transactions, mobile commerce transactions and transactions at the physical point-of-sale using NFC chips. Our top priority is making the act of purchasing online or on-a-mobile device as convenient as when you use your plastic cards, benefiting both consumers and merchants.  Today, 46% of all e-commerce transactions are conducted with a Visa product, and I'm confident Visa is positioned for continued leadership in this category. To that end, we will soon begin rolling out a superior and simple online shopping experience through a Click-to-buy payment capability, which will be available on mobile devices and at home on your computer.  Our Click-to-buy and touch to buy functionality includes aliasing capabilities requiring only a user name and a password at checkout. This increases ease of use and customer convenience, while maintaining the highest levels of security for Visa cardholder accounts.  Rollout of our Click-to-buy functionality begins in November with pilot programs and integration with merchants. Following that, we will introduce subsequent releases in the first quarter of calendar year 2012, expanding functionality to include loyalty programs and the like over the following months. In parallel, we are committed to consumer choice and developing partnerships to ensure that core Visa products can be used easily no matter which wallet a consumer chooses to use. Our recent agreements to license payWave technology to Google Wallet and Isis are 2 prominent examples, and we are actively engaged with other leading players in the social networking, mobile e-commerce and related industries. Another import element of our innovation strategy is creating new offerings that deliver differentiated value with the tremendous data that Visa generates. Our scale and reach provide the most compelling transaction information available in the world, and we will use this data to strategically grow our business.  We use that advantage today in applying aggregated anonymous data to power our advanced authorization service, which has helped to drive fraud rates to the lowest level in years. And now we intend to extend that capability to drive even more value to consumers as well as merchants. Let me be clear that we are 100% committed to maintaining the highest standard of security and privacy with this information. And of course, account-specific information will only be used with direct consumer permission. One example of what Visa can do with the information products is our real-time messaging service, which brings benefits of the virtual world to the point of sale. We are building sales momentum, and now have 14 major merchants under contract representing 68 brands across a wide range of verticals. We are exploring ways in which this platform can be leveraged to enhance issuers' relationship with their cardholders.  Prominent partners signed during the fourth quarter include United MileagePlus, Nordstrom's, Guess and Petco, and we are working towards more deals in the near term. I strongly believe this transaction in the market is a testament to the effectiveness of this product in enhancing the value proposition Visa offers to merchants by helping to drive their customer loyalty and sales, while also incenting routing decisions to the Visa network. Outside the U.S., we are investing in innovative mobile money solutions in both developed and emerging markets, recognizing that different geographies require specifically tailored [indiscernible]. An important key to our efforts is Fundamo, the global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing market. Fundamo has a track record of more than 50 successful client deployments in 40 countries including 27 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East and is in the process of integrating its mobile money services platform with VisaNet in an array of Visa products and services. I look forward to providing some important updates on our progress in the coming months. So to sum it up, I think the examples showcased by today highlight how Visa is building off of our strong foundation and moving ahead both in the U.S. and around the world. We are harnessing our strong core businesses, our competitive differentiators and our ongoing focus on new technologies to position Visa for revenue growth and as a leader of the payments industry well into the future. And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron.\nByron H. Pollitt: Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 13% net revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again broad based with solid 8% growth in the United States and a very strong 19% growth rate in Rest of World. Approximately 65% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 45% of Visa's total. Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 7 consecutive quarters of positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of August and September comped at 11% respectively, which continues the strong growth we have seen all year. While encouraging, much of this volume over the past year has been driven by affluent cardholders. As we enter fiscal 2012, it is worth noting that we have not yet seen any discernible broadening of the U.S. credit spending base beyond this affluent income group. Third, client incentives for the quarter, as a percent of gross revenue, were 19.5%, resulting in a full year incentive level of 17%, slightly ahead of our full fiscal year expectation. Two incentive callouts. First, on the issuing side. As telegraphed on our last earnings call, a disproportionate number of our contracts got signed in Q4. Second, on the acceptance side, we experienced greater success than anticipated in the signing of partnership contracts with merchants and acquirers.  Finally, operating expenses for the quarter were 2% above the prior year, while on a fiscal year basis, they were up 7%. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $30 million of previously unplanned restructuring expenses, close to 1/2 of which were the result of the decommissioning of our London office. The majority of these positions will be relocated to other countries, placing them closer to the clients we serve. And of course, we also incurred incremental expenses associated with the acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo.  Excluding the restructuring and acquisition-related cost, expense growth this fiscal year was in-line with our expectations for heightened investment spending to support our core businesses, our e-commerce and mobile initiatives, as well as the growth of our CyberSource business internationally.  Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for both the June and September quarters, as well as results through October 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012.  Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 13%, relatively flat from the June quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the September quarter: In the U.S, payment volume growth was 9%, a slight decrease from the 10% growth we saw in the June quarter; Rest of World payment volume, on a constant-dollar basis grew at 18%, unchanged from the June quarter.  More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 9%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the fourth quarter, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin.  Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 15% growth rate on a constant-dollar basis in the September quarter, up slightly from a 14% rate in the June quarter. We continue to see a recovery in inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa and the longer-term trend, absent an economic downturn, appears to be back on track. Through October 21, cross-border volumes on a constant-dollar basis grew 13%. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $13 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 9% increase over the prior-year period and modestly behind the 11% growth rate we saw in the June quarter. Through October 21, process transactions posted growth of 8%.  Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in regions outside of the United States, previously enacted pricing changes and solid cross-border transaction growth.  For the full fiscal year 2011, net revenues were $9.2 billion, a 14% increase over the prior year. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue was moderated by our hedging activities and contributed 2 percentage points of growth in Q4 and on a full year basis. Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% over the prior-year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the June quarter, as well as previously enacted strategic pricing adjustments.  Data processing revenue was $925 million, up 10% over the prior year's quarter and based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions. On that note, CyberSource posted a 31% gain in transaction over the prior year's quarter and 36% growth for the full fiscal year.  International transaction revenue was up 23% to $758 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes, strategic pricing adjustments outside the United States and above-average currency volatility during the period. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the full year came in at 17%, slightly ahead of a guidance, but fully consistent with our strategy to incent U.S. merchants and acquirers to choose Visa when routing signature and PIN debit transactions. Total operating expense for the quarter was $1 billion, up 2% from the prior year. As a reminder, these results include operating expenses for CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, of which the latter 2 were not included in Q4 of the prior year. For the full fiscal year 2011, expenses totaled $3.7 million, a 7% increase over the 2010 period. As a final reminder, last October, we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass-through activities. Consistent with this announcement, $45 million of revenue and expense, which were booked in Q4 fiscal year 2010, did not reoccur in Q4 fiscal year 2011. In the current quarter, this represented 2 percentage points of revenue growth.  Our operating margin for the quarter was 57% after absorbing 120 basis points of impact from onetime restructuring charges. Our full fiscal year operating margin was 59%, in-line with our yearly guidance. Capital expenditures were $117 million in the quarter and totaled $353 million for the year. This was on target with last quarter's revised guidance. On the acquisition front, the PlaySpan acquisition was EPS dilutive by $0.01 for the fourth quarter and $0.03 for the full year. The Fundamo acquisition was EPS dilutive by $0.01 in the fourth quarter and $0.02 for the full year. Finally, our reported GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 35% and 35.5% for the full year. Adjusting to exclude the beneficial impact of the put revaluation last quarter, the tax rate would have been 36.3% for the fiscal year, consistent with our guidance. As Joe mentioned, we were buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing 5.2 million shares at an average price of $80.87. For the full fiscal year, Visa spent $3.2 billion to effectively repurchase 43 million shares at an average price of $74.94. Inclusive of dividend payments, we returned over $3.6 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2011. At the end of the quarter, we had 687 million shares outstanding on an as-converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 692 million.  Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion increase to our existing share repurchase plan. Our current open to buy now stands at approximately $1.6 billion. As has been our practice, we will execute trades at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa. We also raised our annual dividend 47% to $0.88 per share, which represents a payout ratio of about 17% on 2011 adjusted earnings. Finally, our guidance for fiscal 2012. Last quarter, we communicated to you our expectation for revenue and earnings. As Joe said at the outset, we remain comfortable with that initial look. Net revenue growth in the high single to low double-digit range and diluted EPS growth in the mid to high teens. Client incentives are expected to range from 17% to 18% of gross revenues. The modest uptick over fiscal 2011 is driven by a growing level of incentives for financial institutions outside the United States, in combination with incentive contracts with large merchants aimed at influencing routing decisions for Visa debit transactions. Marketing expense is projected to be under $1 billion, while somewhat higher than the past 2 years, it is reflective of incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies, our new product initiatives, recent acquisitions as well as some modest incremental spend associated with Visa's sponsorship of the summer Olympic game. Operating margin is expected to remain at about 60%. The cash tax rate is expected to be in the 33% to 34% range. This reduction anticipates a change in the formula for calculating our state tax rate, as well as our initial filing for foreign tax credit.  Since this lower tax rate is expected to be ongoing, it will likely result in a revaluation of our deferred tax liability. This onetime non-cash adjustment may reduce Visa's tax rate an additional 1 to 2 percentage points for the year. However, to be clear, our adjusted earnings per share growth target for 2012 assumes a 33% to 34% cash rate. Capital expenditures are projected to range from $350 million to $400 million. This represents a modest increase over the $353 million we spent in 2011 and fully funds investments we're making across the globe in support of our core business as well as our mobile and e-commerce initiative. Finally, we expect free cash flow above $4 billion. Our priorities for use of this cash remain the same: First, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisition; and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. As the fiscal 2013 guidance, as we previously stated in July, we expect an acceleration of revenue and EPS off 2012 levels. We will provide additional clarity around 2013 as we approach the beginning of that fiscal year. And with that operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bob Napoli, William Blair.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Question on the incentives. What are the length of terms of the merchant contracts, and would we expect to see the incentives higher earlier in the year as you continue to aggressively negotiate these routing incentives with the merchants?\nByron H. Pollitt: Hi. Byron. The answer is the -- let's say, the average length of the merchant contracts that we have been signing are about 2 years. And to your second question, I would say no, they would be more \"back end of year\" weighted, once we begin to see what the actual routing experience is related to those contacts. Much of what was booked in the fourth quarter was onetime, and therefore, the bulk of the incentives associated with this will be validated during the course of the year once we understand what the actual routing experience is.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.\nJason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to ask a question related to the non-U.S. side of the business. Obviously, the growth remains very strong there. And I want to get a directional sense on the kind of revenue yield you are seeing outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S. I guess we tend to think that it's less outside the U.S. because you aren't processing as much or as many of your own transactions there. So I just wanted to get a sense that if we continue to see this trend of non-U.S. growing revs and volumes faster than the U.S., what does that imply for overall operating margins over the longer term if you continue to go through that makeshift and ultimately get non-U.S. to be north of 50% of total revs?\nJoseph W. Saunders: We've never disclosed what the revenues are in the countries outside the United States. Obviously, when we're not processing, there is a different yield structure. I just have to say that what is growing are our net revenues as a percentage of our total net revenues. So net of incentives, these are the revenues that we're booking. And so, I think that's a pretty good news story.\nByron H. Pollitt: And let me add 2 dynamics here. As we begin to grow and penetrate outside the United States, remember, the first areas that are penetrated tend to be cross-volume, cross-border types of transactions. So the yields there, early in the development curve, are much higher. As we begin to penetrate more and more domestic payment volume of countries outside the United States, domestic comes with less international. And therefore, the yields, frankly, in any country, including the United States, will naturally move down as domestic picks up a bigger piece of the payment volume. And then there's one final dynamic, which is actually important to understanding how our incentives behave in 2012, which is, when we originally went public, the notion of having multi-year contracts was primarily a U.S. phenomenon. What has happened over time is that we have pursued a deliberate strategy of entering into multi-year contracts with our major clients. As we have pursued that aggressively outside the United States, the quid pro quo for a multi-year contract is incentives. So as we put more, as our volumes build overseas, as more and more of our clients are under multi-year contract, our incentives will just naturally rise, which then has an impact on yield. So to sum, the most important element is what Joe said, we have a much higher degree of processing penetration in the U.S. Outside the U.S., because of that, it tends to be lower. But we pursue the strategies that optimize the growth of our revenue, and it is revenue measured in dollars we saw [ph] for, not yield.\nOperator: The next question comes Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin T Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just wanted to ask about client incentives as well, just in the quarter to clarify. Now these one timers designed to secure, I think, you said it was for merchant commitments. But did you also secure some network commitments from the issuers as well? And is there a way to quantify what percent of at-risk volume you've actually protected?\nByron H. Pollitt: It's merchant and acquirers, not issuers, which have been the focus, Tien-Tsin. And these contracts don't guarantee volume. What they do is they incent volume. And at this point, we're not public on the amount of volume, but it's a meaningful increment of volume that is influenced by these contracts.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, I mean, as I mentioned in the script, we signed PNC to a longer-term contract. And we obviously have continued negotiations going on with all of our clients. And well, what Byron is talking about is generally the PIN volume and the decision to route the transaction that's in the hands of the merchant or the acquirer. There still are decisions that issuers make as it relates to the signature portion of the card, and we're in a very comfortable position as it relates to that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.\nGlenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Lot of a good color on the call here. We're getting a lot of questions on the impact on debit growth from all these checking and DDA fees that banks are levying. So I think if you give us some color could kind of help investors out quite a bit. I mean, what's your take on how this could impact volume growth going forward? And can you draw any correlations to other experiences in the payment industry to kind of defend your view?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, first of all, I think the banks are clearly making recent business decisions to adapt in this newly regulated environment. I think all of the banks recognize that their customers have an option to move to a competitor. But they believe, in whatever case you're talking about, that their pricing or their future pricing will reflect the value, will reflect the value that they offer to their customers and the value that the customers bring to them. That being said, I don't believe that anything that's happening is going to substantially alter the macro debit volume in the United States. I don't think it's going to go away. Even the one fee that has been specifically announced is a flat fee. It doesn't make any difference. It's not a per-transaction fee, or anything of that nature. I think that, as a result of the recession and the result of the CARD Act, as a result of the Durbin legislation, you're also seeing a lot more activity wind up in prepaid cards. And our growth in that regard, which is really part of our debit-processing environment, is very significant also.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.\nJulio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just want to go back to one item that I know came up here in the quarter about small ticket items and the pricing on those transactions. Can you guys go back and just walk us through what the sort of situation is there in terms of what pricing looks like and maybe how some of the potential unintended consequences here are being resolved with small ticket merchants?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, I mean that's a good question. The answer is that there were a series of events that occurred, and the end result is that small ticket prices from both associations, were raised to the cap of the Durbin legislation. And I'm not sure that I'm not ready to comment on whether that is absolutely the right thing to do or not. What I will say is that we're pretty confident that there is an answer somewhere on the continuum that will benefit both financial institutions, consumers and merchants. And of course, we will endeavor to be a part of getting to the right solution over a reasonably short period of time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just wanted to ask Byron about the incentives to merchants. You said the incentives for routing are for both signature and PIN. Just wanted to ask about the signature piece. What would you be incentivizing them for? Maybe you can explain that. Kind of semi-related to that, you guys think that some volume will go more towards PIN debit than signature debit in the marketplace and maybe why that would be?\nByron H. Pollitt: So probably better expressed is, these are incentive agreements to deliver payment volume, whether it is signature or whether it is PIN. And so, that's the way to characterize that. And we'll just have to see how this plays out in terms of movement between signature and PIN. From our standpoint, it's important to preserve the routing. That's what we're focused on. And whether it's signature or PIN, we'll take both.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Remember, when we incent merchants to deliver volume, there's a lot of things that they can do in-store or otherwise with their customers that incent their customers to use these cards. And we've done that over the years in a pretty significant way, and we'll continue to do that. But it's important to us, so Byron's point of incenting merchants to deliver volume is exactly the right direction.\nOperator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.\nDarrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just when you guys had initially given guidance after some of the Durbin announcements, there was -- it was a discussion with conservatism embedded in on the guidance around what Durbin could mean. Just wondering, since that point, there's been some comments I think, Joe, you made since that point, that have suggested that I think you think you're going to come out okay on this. Just wondering, has anything changed in your expectations around what Durbin will impact your revenue by or your earning's power by? And then maybe just talk a little bit about also whether or not some of the embedded assumptions and conservatism guidance have shifted from Durbin to the macro picture?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, I mean, obviously, the macro picture, Durbin, our business outside the United States, our prepaid and commercial businesses. When we give guidance, we embrace all of those things. And so, we gave guidance several months ago. We're delivering the same guidance today. We remain extraordinarily comfortable with that guidance. And everything that we think about Durbin, about the economy, about our competitive position is embraced within that guidance. And right now, we're very happy with where we are and what we're suggesting that we're going to do. And we'll see where it goes. But there's nothing that's happened in the last several months that would change our position on this.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Back in late September, we heard from industry contacts that Visa is moving to what we've been calling a common-switch strategy. And so, I wanted to ask about the revenue implications of the common-switch strategy. You alluded to this capability in your opening remarks. In particular, will PIN transactions on VisaNet be priced the same as Interlink PIN transactions in terms of network fees charged to both merchants and issuers? And if you can comment to the issuers receiving this common-switch strategy with open arms at this point?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, we are pursuing the strategy. We're comfortable with it. I mentioned it earlier today. We haven't had any negative reaction that I'm aware of. There is some work that needs to take place, but it is a rule, and I have no reason to believe that people won't adhere to it. In order to compete for a routing transaction in a predominantly PIN environment, it's going to have to be at similar pricing or the same pricing or lower pricing. And it's got to be Interlink-type pricing or we won't win the transaction, so I think that, that answers that question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was wondering, not to beat the incentives thing too much to death, but you mentioned that a large portion of them were onetime. Did that include the incentives that went to merchants? Because I mean, I just was hoping you could explain how that would kind of spur them to bring volume with onetime incentives. And could you just also walk through just the signature PIN, the ability I guess to route over the signature network the PIN transactions that you alluded to?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, let me take the second part of the question first, and then I think I'll turn it over to Byron. But the ability to accept a PIN on our debit card network or our signature network is something that has existed for quite some time. We authorize millions of transactions a year, millions, which PIN numbers are used on our signature debit card. While we have defined it more specifically to make sure that everybody understands the capability and hasn't lost the functionality to be able to do that, but it is been a part of our signature card for many, many years.\nByron H. Pollitt: And to answer your first part of your question, the answer is, yes, that the one timers we're referring to were predominantly associated with the merchant and acquired contracts referenced earlier.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.\nDavid Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Could you give us some or quantify, if you will, Byron, the U.S. debit volume growth trends you've seen since interchange was cut 45% for issuers on October 1?\nByron H. Pollitt: Honestly, it's way too early to comment on that. So we have seen no discernible change in U.S. debit volume associated with that October 1 date with the shift in the interchange. And that is something that we will give periodic updates on, of course, as the year unfolds. We are as interested in that as you are.\nOperator: The next question comes from Moshe Katri, Cowen.\nMoshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So considering some of the structural changes that are taking place on the debit side, is Visa doing anything different to maybe gain share in credit? And then, in that respect, can you also comment on whether some of the slowdown that we've seen as of October in some of the metrics, is that -- I mean, is there anything you can comment on that? Is there anything you can -- can you say anything about that in terms of maybe a proxy for future trends?\nByron H. Pollitt: Why don't I take the second part first. The trends that we outlined earlier in my talk demonstrated a pretty strong September ending quarter. So I would say, whether you're looking at the U.S. or whether you're looking at Rest of World, those were pretty strong growth numbers. And it didn't look like we were missing a beat. And I'm looking at the numbers now. Split between credit and debit, both of them looked pretty strong, U.S. and Rest of World. And on top of that, these numbers are comping some pretty serious growth numbers in the prior year. When we move into October, recognizing that's only 21 days, I think in any given month, that is hardly a trend for a quarter. And I would say that there's nothing in the trend data yet to show any material shift in the trend curve.\nJoseph W. Saunders: As it relates to pursuing credit card business, that is one of our primary focuses. I think we've talked about it before. I think we've talked about the relationships we have with our clients. We've talked about partnerships that we signed and talked [ph] today, and we're very pleased with where we are. And we are extraordinarily client focused, and we are working with each of our clients on an individual basis to help them develop a credit card strategy, particularly, if they want to expand it, and many of them do. And I think that, that will be one of the big success stories of 2012.\nOperator: The next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.\nGlenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to ask about it was kind of noticeable that U.S. credit volume growth outpaced debit volume growth in the quarter. It's probably the first time in, I would guess, years? And I was wondering if you can give some commentary on what sort of drove that? Did it perhaps have to do with some kind of competitive factors, i.e., some customer losses or maybe some customer response related to Durbin to drive credit volumes in lieu of debit. Just some color and commentary there.\nByron H. Pollitt: Yes, so, you're right. This is -- I'm looking at the data right now. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of credit card year-over-year growth. Eight quarters ago, it was actually negative. And I think what we're seeing here is a just a continuation of a recovery. The recession hit credit hard, and it actually turned growth negative. And I'm speaking here of the U.S. And so, in the first quarter of recovery, which was second quarter, our second fiscal quarter 2010, growth was 3% year-over-year. It has gradually moved up, so that now, for the quarter just ended, it's 10%, 10% in October. And so for us, this is been a gradual return to credit. It's been a sustained but very modestly paced build. And then, as you may recall from my earnings commentary today and really over the past several quarters, this is a credit recovery that is primarily in the U.S. affluent driven. And that through the quarter, through, I would say the June quarter, which is the data where we have more granular data, this growth is primarily affluent, and we haven't really seen a broadening of the credit base yet. So that's in terms of increased and growth and spend [ph]. And so, that is the opportunity to come. And with a further recovery, we expect credit to benefit -- future credit benefit growth to benefit from that expanded set of cardholders.\nOperator: The last question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital.\nDaniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So as we look at the trends for worldwide process transactions, and I know that the absolute number transactions are still relatively high, but that trend has been coming down throughout the year. And then most recent data, Byron, that you pointed to, is around 8%. So it continues to be kind of on the downward slope. So I'm wondering, what do you attribute that to? And then secondly, to the extent that, that trend continues, do you feel like your business and your strategy going forward is such that you can drive incremental revenue growth, I think from a greater standpoint from increasing prices, throughout the year as opposed to just kind of the secular volume growth?\nByron H. Pollitt: Our focus on growth is primarily the secular growth. We're not looking to drive any material top line revenue growth from pricing, recognizing that when we talk about pricing, that's pricing net of incentives. So it's one thing to adjust your pricing at the top level. But in the end, it's your net pricing that really matters. And so, it is primarily secular growth, which is one of the reasons why we continue to emphasize how much growth we are now delivering outside the United States. And in the quarter just ended, 65% of our growth, our revenue growth, came from outside the United States. And in the fourth quarter, 45% of our entire revenue base is now outside the United States. And as you know, we have an objective to drive that over 50%, and that is absolutely secular growth. With regards to the process transaction growth, that is primarily attributable to 2 things: one, a slowing in the growth rate of U.S. debit; and then second, a year ago, we began -- we had some significant increases in transaction penetration outside the United States, which are now beginning to anniversary. And so, where we are today and that drift down into high single digits, in terms of Visa process transactions, is primarily influenced by those 2 factors for the moment. But we are very focused in our future strategies at increasing Visa process transactions, increasing the percent of transactions, particularly outside the United States, that Visa processes as a function of the total transactions that are performed on Visa cards. And that's where we stand.\nJack Carsky: Thank you, Jos\u00e9, and thank you, all, for joining us today.

Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net revenues of more than $2.3 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth around the globe, strong cross-border activity and continued recovery in credit spend worldwide. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes the gain from revaluing the Visa Europe put option was $883 million, a 23% increase over last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.26, a 29% increase over the third quarter of 2010.  Our performance over the past quarter reaffirms Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and services offering, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide.  Before turning to the business highlights, I'd like to update you on Visa's activities to adapt to the new United States regulatory environment. As stated during our update call on July 6, overall, I continue to expect the impact resulting from regulation to be dilutive but manageable with fiscal 2012, bearing the majority of the financial impact. It is important to appreciate that we were prepared for a wide range of outcomes. And with the Federal Reserve's final rules in hand, we have the clarity needed to execute on our strategies. We are now moving forward on multiple fronts and with a variety of new offerings for our clients. And today, I'd like to share with you, at a high level, a feel of our areas of focus.  We will offer additional detail in the coming quarters once we've had the opportunity to further discuss these strategies with our clients and partners. Regulation has dramatically altered the competitive environment in the United States and given merchants' broad discretion over how transactions will be routed. Recognizing this new dynamic, we are resetting our business approach and implementing a number of new strategies for all products.  Specifically for debit, we will continue to focus on maintaining Visa debit issuance through strong partnerships with our issuing clients, thereby positioning Visa to compete for as many transactions as possible. Equally important, we will ensure that Visa is positioned to compete for routing for merchants and acquirers by strengthening these important relationships. We are adapting Visa's business to deliver even more value to all participants in the value chain, while preserving our ability to grow and positioning Visa for continued leadership in the U.S.  Our approach is based on multiple actions, which were incorporated into the guidance we provided earlier this month. I'm going to address 2 of them now.  First, we are modifying our economics in a way that we expect will result in a reduction in merchant cost in total and on the margin. The modifications include both fixed processing fees and a reduction in variable fees. We expect this will help us win routing decisions and maintain debit volume in the new environment. Specifically, Visa is implementing a new fixed acquirer fee called the network participation fee, which will apply to the acceptance of all Visa products and is based on both the size of the merchant and the number of merchant location. This fee will allow Visa to continue investing in our secure, reliable and interoperable global payments network, a long-standing area of strength for our organization. These attributes are cornerstones of Visa's brand promise, and it is critical that we make ongoing upgrades, innovations and enhancements.  In fact, Visa facilitates issuer-standing processing each day for more than 600,000 transactions, minimizing system disruption and ensuring more transactions get completed. In order to reduce fees in the aggregate, Visa will also lower our variable processing fees for all Visa debit products across all merchant segments. That combination of fixed and variable fees offers merchants an even greater incentive throughout more transactions over our network by providing them an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction costs and take advantage of economies of scale that are now more readily available to them.  As I said a few moments ago, our 2012 guidance, which incorporates the reductions we expect at Visa's debit, volumes and fees and the fees we charge also reflects our appreciation that regulation has changed the landscape in which we operate.  We recognized that we need to focus more than ever on delivering greater value to both issuers and merchants to win debit routing while continuing to grow our successful credit business. In that regard, we are taking multiple actions to ensure we are well-positioned to compete for both issuance and routing. We will extend the merchants of all sizes through direct negotiations and through acquirers the successful partnership programs we have historically offered issuers. We will also increase our engagement with merchant associations to achieve the same goal. Now a broad set of acquirers and merchants can receive incentives from Visa in exchange for routing commitments.  The second quarter element of our strategy focuses on additional investment and value-added services aimed at winning routing decisions. These include powerful merchant benchmark analytics, loyalty rewards programs and realtime mobile messaging to drive merchant sales growth.  For example, we continue to make progress on our realtime messaging program, including the Gap's recent decision to expand their existing program across more brands in their portfolio as well as new agreements with the Sports Authority and the Kangaroo Express, a leading convenience store operator in the Southeastern United States with more than 1,600 locations.  With these actions, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the United States and positioning Visa to grow from here. We are 100% prepared. We are fully engaged with our key stakeholders. We are focused on their needs and we are moving forward.  Taken together, our strategies will provide Visa with a strong foundation to adapt to the new landscape while also generating sufficient revenue to make the investments needed to drive forward the future of this industry. Of course, while the regulatory process generated headlines over the past 13 months, the overwhelming majority of Visa's revenues are derived from products and geographies that are completely untouched by VisaNet. And in that regard, I'm pleased to say that Visa's employees maintained their focus and continued to advance our growth agenda.  In the U.S., we saw a continued strong performance in credit, posting Visa's sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Of note, affluent credit posted particularly strong performance, growing 3 times faster than the overall credit category. Building on that success, we announced a multiyear agreement with United Continental Holdings to continue to issue co-branded Mileage Plus Visa cards. The recent merger of the United and Continental Airlines will result in the consolidation of their card portfolios under Mileage Plus, and the combined entity will begin exclusively issuing Mileage Plus Visa cards to all new customers beginning January 1, 2012. An important aspect of this major co-brand program is the proportionally larger number of affluent card carriers, and the greater cross-border volume usage associated with Mileage Plus Visa cards, all big benefits to Visa's overall growth.  Another key renewal was with Disney, with whom we have enjoyed an important co-branding and promotional relationship for many years. Outside of the U.S., International markets are increasingly important contributor of Visa's growth, increasing payment volume by 17%, which is driving approximately 60% of the company's overall revenue growth. In line with our strategic aspiration to grow Visa's business outside the U.S., we continue to make progress on our long-standing commitment to invest in key markets that show the greatest potential.  In critical markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, the GCC, Mexico and Sub Saharan Africa, we have tailored acceleration plans to substantially increase revenue growth over a 5-year horizon. We will continue to target additional countries for our investment in 2012 and beyond.  For example, in Russia, one of the fastest-growing countries globally, we are focused on delivering the core Visa product at value proposition and continuing to expand acceptance. We are investing to enhance mass credit and premium credit offerings and delivering products like prepaid and Visa Money Transfer to our Russian issuers and consumers.  In Brazil, where the acquiring landscape is changing, Visa is accelerating growth of processed transactions versus new acquirer relationships in renewing issuing partnerships. We continue to differentiate ourselves by delivering superior products across our core portfolio of credit, debit, small business and commercial solutions.  We also continue to advance our core product growth in India, establishing new or expanded agreements with several large clients, including the Life Insurance Corporation of India as well as the State Bank of India. As I mentioned earlier in the quarter, we signed a multiyear agreement to support Visa debit products across the State Bank of India franchise. In just a few short months, over 1 million Visa debit cards have been issued as part of this program.  In Japan, we are accelerating growth by driving more sophisticated product offerings, such as co-brand programs with major issuers, merchants and commercial card programs that deliver solutions to more mature electronic payments environments. For example, we recently launched a debit program with Resona Bank, Japan's fourth largest financial institution. It's our first traditional debit program in that market, and we are hopeful that it will lead to similar programs with other clients, accelerating the migration towards electronic payments in Japan's traditionally cash-centric economy. And we are partnering with clients and governments and investing in long-term growth in developing markets in Africa, Latin America and South Asia to accelerate efforts to advance financial inclusion and ultimately grow domestic transaction growth.  On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. We continue to make progress on Visa's next-generation e-commerce and mobile payment solutions announced in May, including a focus on single-click and aliasing capabilities. We believe these elements of the Visa offering will help to differentiate and deliver value to the other NFC-only solutions recently announced. This remains a top priority for the organization, and we are moving full speed ahead towards broad commercial availability.  As we've said all along, Visa firmly believes an open approach is the key to success in mobile commerce. So in addition to building Visa's own capability, our strategy must also enable Visa payments on third-party platforms. That's why last week, we announced an agreement with Isis to join their consortium and we continue to engage in productive discussions with other potential partners.  Part of our efforts to make mobile a reality in emerging markets, we completed our acquisition of Fundamo, a leading mobile wallet software provider for emerging markets with over 40 programs in more than 25 countries. I can report that the integration is progressing well and we are now focused on building managed services for issuers and mobile operators around the Fundamo platform. Additionally, we are developing capabilities to overlay a virtual Visa prepaid account on the closed loop accounts managed by Fundamo and other wallet platforms.  Since our announcement, we have received substantial interest from issuers and mobile operators into Asia and Latin America. We are also taking action to further tap into the creativity and the expertise of the developer community, an increasingly critical participant in the creation and rollout of new payment technology.  Today, our existing developer center has more than 6,000 active developers using our tools and resources to build Visa payment functionality into websites for mobile applications, which in turn brings more merchants into the Visa network, ultimately driving transactions and payments growth. Additionally, through the center, Visa helps reduce e-commerce transaction risks, which means even more transactions are approved and flow through the network. This makes Visa a more attractive payment network partner.  To accelerate these efforts, we will launch our expanded Visa developer center in the current quarter, combining our existing PlaySpan and CyberSource developer activities into a single platform while also introducing direct connectivity to VisaNet for the first time. By connecting directly to VisaNet, we can offer our merchant partners and financial institution customers faster and easier access to Visa products and services, making them more competitive and ultimately driving incremental revenue growth.  On the e-commerce front, CyberSource's business continues to gain traction in the marketplace. During the quarter, billable transactions totaled just over $1 billion, a very strong 38% growth rate over the same period a year ago. We secured a number of new business wins with major merchants, including Twitter and Torno [ph]. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business, as e-commerce growth remains strong in the United States and internationally.  Finally, we continue to deliver on our long-standing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. Today, we are pleased to announce that our board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. This comes on the heels of completing our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized in April. At approximately $77 per share, we retired 13.7 million shares in the quarter. This brings our repurchases in fiscal 2011, including escrow funding actions, to $2.8 billion.  In conclusion, as we reorient the U.S. debit business in the wake of the new regulations, we will simultaneously pursue our growth strategies both at home and abroad. Our commitment to our clients, new product rollouts and ongoing innovation combine to make Visa's value proposition more compelling than ever. And we are prepared to use our comprehensive array of products and functionalities to win in the marketplace. Visa remains a strong, globally-oriented growth company as we move ahead.  With that, let me turn the call over to Byron.\nByron Pollitt: Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth was once again broad based with solid 9% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Over 62% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means the non-U.S. revenue is now 44% of Visa's total, up from 41% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.  Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 6 consecutive quarters of positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of May and June comped at 8% and 12%, respectively, which continues the strong growth we have seen all year. We continue to be encouraged by this trend.  Third, incentives for the quarter as a percent of growth revenue was 16.2%, down from 16.7% in the second quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, incentives as a percent of gross revenue was 16.1%, in line with the lower end of our guidance. However, as we stated on our update call on July 6, we expect client incentives for the full fiscal year to be at the top end of the 16% to 16.5% range based on the pacing of our contract pipeline and potential Q4 partnership contract that provide merchant incentives aimed at further encouraging Visa routing preference.  Fourth, as first discussed back in January, we sold our 10% stake in Visa Vale, a Brazilian prepaid issuer. Though we expect to book the gain as investment income in our second quarter, we actually recorded a gain in Q3 once we received the necessary Brazilian regulatory approval. The net benefit to Visa in the quarter was $85 million pretax and $44 million after tax.  Finally, as we did in the fourth fiscal quarter last year, we revalued the Visa Europe put option, which had a positive noncash impact to our earnings this quarter. The $122 million decrease in the value of the option is nontaxable, is reported in other income and is solely due to decline in Visa's TE ratio relative to historical level. It does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise the put. The put option is now valued on our balance sheet at $145 million. Eliminating this impact provides a cleaner picture of our operating performance, and yields an adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the quarter.  Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the March and June quarters, as well as the results through July 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal years 2011 and 2012.  Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollar was 13%, relatively flat from the March quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the June quarter. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 10%, a slight decrease from the 12% growth we saw in the March quarter. Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 17%, up 2 points from the 15% growth rate in the March quarter. More recently, through July 21, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 10%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the third quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth to be higher. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 14% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the June quarter, up slightly from a 13% rate in the March quarter. We have seen some rebound in inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa, but it is still too early to gauge the longer-term trends. Through July 21, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 18%.  Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an 11% increase over the year ago period and modestly behind the 13% growth rate we saw in the March quarter. Through July 21, processed transactions posted growth of 10%.  Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal third quarter, gross revenue of $2.8 billion was up 14% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in regions outside of the U.S., continued recovery in the U.S. economy, previously enacted pricing changes and solid cross-border transaction growth.  Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the March quarter and the impact of pricing adjustments. Data processing revenue was $886 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions.  International transaction revenue was up 15% to $652 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes during the period. As I mentioned, client incentives as a percent of gross revenue came in at 16.2% and are running at 16.1% fiscal year-to-date, on track with expectations. Total operating expense for the quarter is $977 million, up 10% from the prior year. As a reminder, these results include operating expenses for CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, none of which were included in Q3 of the prior year. While marketing expense was up, approximately $70 million on a sequential quarter basis, this was due to the timing of planned campaign and is consistent with our full year guidance of less than $900 million.  In the U.S., we have continued to rightsize our spend, and refine our marketing focus to put greater investment toward digital media. We have also focused on marketing efforts on driving greater cross-border transaction growth. As a reminder, last October, we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentations related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass-through activity. Consistent with this announcement, $52 million of revenue and expense, which was booked in Q3 fiscal year 2010, did not reoccur in Q3 fiscal year 2011. In Q3, this represented 3 percentage points of revenue growth.  The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the third fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity, and contributed 2 percentage points of growth. Our operating margin for the quarter was 58%, on target with our expectation for the full year. Capital expenditures were $89 million in the quarter and now total $236 million year-to-date.  Given the pace of our investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives, we now expect our full year 2011 capital spending to be moderately above $300 million.  On the acquisition front, the PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the third quarter. For the full year 2011, we anticipate a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.04. The Fundamo acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the third quarter. Full year EPS dilution is also expected to be $0.01. Finally, our recorded tax rate for the period was 35%, including the favorable impact from the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe consumption. Adjusting to exclude the put impact, the tax rate would have been 38%. On an as adjusted basis, we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be consistent with our guidance.  As we announced on July 6, we completed the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board in April. During the quarter, we spent $1.1 billion to repurchase 13.7 million shares at an average price of $77.36. Year-to-date, Visa has spent $2.8 billion to effectively repurchase 37.8 million shares at an average price of $74.12. At the end of the quarter, we had 691 million shares outstanding on an as converted basis.  Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Bill mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion repurchase plan through July 20, 2012, which we will execute at prices we feel are attractive, relative to the long-term value of Visa.  As to guidance, for the balance of 2011, given results to date, and to reiterate what we told you on the July 6 call, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and EPS growth of better than 20%. Client incentives are expected to come in at the top end of the 16% to 16.5% range. And we are now expecting capital expenditures to be moderately above $300 million for the year, up from our prior range of $250 million to $275 million.  Our net revenue outlook for 2012 stands at high single to low double-digit growth, while earnings per share growth is expected to be at the mid- to high teens range. We will have additional guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 when we report our fourth quarter earning in October.  And with that, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.\nJason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Just wanted to ask a question on the network participation fee, and thanks for the disclosures around some of your post-Durbin strategies there. Can you talk a little bit about that network participation fee in the context of some of the what sounded like are fee reductions from merchants and merchant acquirers? Just trying to understand from the Visa point of view how do you envision all that netting out on the merchants/acquiring side of your business?\nJoseph Saunders: I think that our intention is clear, and that is to affect this change in our infrastructure while at the same time reducing fees to all merchants in every category. So the variable fee reductions are obviously an offset to fixed fee. If you look at our 2012 guidance, it presumes that there will be a deterioration in our debit card revenues for the year. We said that 2012 will be the low point. So that is the net result. The net result is that we won't do as well as we have here for in the debit card business at least in 2012. Hopefully, we can grow off of what we do in 2012 to 2013. But what we have done is, in our opinion, consistent with helping to ensure that Visa will be successful in the long run, and done within the spirit, and the intention of the regulation.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on the expense lines on a go forward basis. The personnel and the admin lines are fairly elevated. I was just wondering, is that the run rate to consider on a go forward basis? And also, just the card service fee margin, that seem a little lighter for this quarter sequentially relevant to past quarter, so I was hoping for some color there.\nByron Pollitt: On the personnel, in particular, the expense line items, no, that would -- at least on a percentage increase, that is not the run rate. So in the personnel line in particular, a little over 55% of the year-over-year increase is due to the personnel costs associated with CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, none of which were in Q3 of the prior year. So we're -- we will have a lapping for one more quarter for CyberSource, a few more quarters for the other 2. And we will give more color on the run rate with regards to expenses in the context of our margin, operating margin, at the Q4 earnings call. No real call outs on the service fee. We were pretty pleased with the yields, which held pretty firm for -- sequentially over the 2 quarters. So from that vantage point, no call outs.\nOperator: The next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc: Joe, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit on the new debit pricing strategy, how the issuers might be thinking about that just given sort of the issuers' fee that you try to balance between the merchant acquirers and the issuers. And also, does that impact your ability to raise pricing in the future?\nJoseph Saunders: I don't think that anything that we've done is inconsistent with our commitment to our current clients. In fact, most of what we've done and the restructuring that we've done is to ensure that we can continue to serve them and we can continue to help them run profitable businesses. I think what we've done also reflects our focus on making sure that everyone in the value chain has higher expectations of what they can expect in the future and that that helps regenerate the whole, at least from a debit card point of view, it helps sustain and regenerate the whole process of electronic payments continuing to move forward. I -- what -- there was a second part of the question...\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc: Pricing?\nJoseph Saunders: Oh, it doesn't constrain our ability to price. I don't think that we have done anything that constraints our ability to take actions in the future that we deem to be appropriate. I think the key word here is deem to be appropriate. And right now, we don't have any intention of raising any prices in the United States. I think that we're in the position that we're comfortable with, and that's the way we're going to look at it going forward for the time being.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: I was hoping you could help us understand a little more the magnitude of change between the former pricing structure in debit and what's coming perhaps in the context of the 20% of revenue, 20% plus of revenue, that you've discussed as being generated from U.S. debit. Now I'll totally shift the topic. This morning, Cielo down Brazil held their conference call. They discussed that in a very brief time. LOs are already issued over 0.25 million cards, and that growth rate is accelerating. And I'm curious, if you take into account that the bank's pushing LO or mainly Visa issuers, are you seeing any impact to your growth rate of cards enforced down in Brazil?\nByron Pollitt: So Byron. Let me respond to both questions. With regards to a deeper description of the impact on the 20%, I think the way we've chosen to respond to that for now is related to what we described on our last call that in preparing for a new post-Durbin environment, there are a number of ways this can play out competitively. We have run a variety of scenarios. We have used those to inform the revenue range we gave to you all at the July 6 call. And I think you all recognize that there's a lot of market reaction here yet to unfold. Strategies need to play out before we can be more descriptive about these impacts. And as they do, we will update appropriately. Having said that, we do believe that the primary impact of the Durbin legislation will be felt in 2012, and we would expect to regain some revenue growth momentum in this arena in 2013. With regards to Cielo, it was contemplated all along that Cielo would be entering in this market. It is a lower income profile, lower spend-oriented market segment, and that's a segment very different from the one that we currently occupy. And so from that vantage point, we're -- we feel that the enormous growth we're experiencing in Brazil will continue and the developments we're seeing today are not unexpected.\nOperator: Next question comes from Glenn Fodor, Morgan Stanley.\nGlenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley: Regarding your comments on the July 6 call, and this call as well on, that net revenue growth in fiscal '13 can regain momentum. This is a very important nuance for investors in the street. I was wondering if you can provide us with a little roadmap of how you see that occurring. I mean, I appreciate the color you gave today on Russia, Brazil and India, but those are going to take some time. So where is the fiscal '13 reacceleration going to come from? And then given that margins are pretty healthy already, could we still expect the same spread between revenue and earnings growth and why?\nByron Pollitt: Maybe the best way to respond to that, again, I'm going to elevate a little bit and describe some of the high-level baseline assumptions that we -- that informed the 2012 guidance, recognizing that on the fourth quarter earnings call, that is typically when we would provide more metrics to describe '12, and we'll see about '13. So in '12, we are projecting a global payment volume growth off of current trends adjusted for the investments we are making related to our country acceleration strategies. In U.S. debit, in particular, we do expect, as Joe mentioned, a decrease in yield. We expect to lose some routing, weighted more to PIN. We expect some volume shift from Signature to PIN. We expect much of that to play out in '12, therefore becoming part of our base in '12. And so from a revenue standpoint, by the time we run into 2013, we are benefiting from strong growth outside the United States that is accelerated, based on investments we are making in a number of key markets, to amplify the growth in those markets, and with post-Durbin impacts substantially embedded in the 2012 base, with our strategies in place and gaining more traction with each passing quarter. That is the underpinning of why we would expect to see revenue begin regaining momentum in '13.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: So first, a quick clarification and then I guess an easy question. U.S. guys debit payment volume growth decelerated by a couple of points from March to June. And I guess I'm wondering if Durbin potentially had a disrupted impact at all in your opinion on the debit volume growth. And then the meatier question is really about how do you expect your debit competitors might react to the altered debit pricing structure that you're rolling out? It seems desirable to avoid price-based competition, but it seems price-based competition is now somewhat of a certainty given that the other competitors are likely to respond to your altered structure. So do you expect the other networks to be more aggressive on pricing? And to the extent that they are, are you prepared to do something with your financials to try to buffer the impact, such as cutting advertising expenses, or something along those lines? Can you just give us an idea, because I know you run multiple scenarios on how competitors might react. But if those worser scenarios play out, where pricing competition gets more aggressive on a more aggressive side, you have a kind of a plan b to buffer the impact.\nByron Pollitt: So I'll take the first one. So Rod, with regards to the deceleration in debit, which you will also see in the -- that is also the explanation for why processed -- Visa processed transactions dipped a bit in the quarter. What you're seeing is the tail -- the runoff, so to speak, of the Chase/WaMu Conversion and the initial ramp up of the SunTrust change. And the combination of those 2 completely explain the drop in growth rate down to -- the dropping growth rate on Visa processed transaction. So that's the answer to the first question. Joe?\nJoseph Saunders: And the -- well, the answer to the second question is, yes. We thought very clearly and gone very deeply into what our notions about what our competition would do. We think we have put ourselves in a position where we are more than capable of responding. We have no intention, nor do we think we have to start a race to the bottom. We do have contingency plans. We are very confident in the guidance that we gave you for 2012. And if you can remember, we withheld giving specific guidance on 2012 for quite some time. And we didn't actually say anything until after the Feb regulations came up, so that we could match what the rules said to what our plans were. We've done that. We're confident we're going to get where we said -- where we say we are going to go. I just would add to what Byron said earlier. He explained to you why 2013 might go up. I will also tell you that I think that 2012 is an extraordinarily achievable objective.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I had a couple of quick clarifications tuned in on each question I had as well. Just on the fixed fee versus lower variable fee strategy. I just want to make sure, is this just for debit? Or is it also for other Visa products? And also, just the impact on the P&L, does this -- I'm just trying to reconcile the strategy versus, Byron, the guidance you talked about the fourth quarter and the incentives picking up to win routing decisions. Is that one and the same? Or are they 2 different strategies? And then my primary question was just around the International volume that did accelerate. It looks like, and yes, it did accelerate in every region. So how much of that acceleration is from new programs being launched versus just a pickup in underlying same-store growth? Or is same-store secular growth obviously a lot of focus on the macro today?\nByron Pollitt: Yes, so with -- on the last one, it is same-store growth without question. That's the accelerator; fixed fee, all products and the 2 different strategies. So when we talked about entering into some additional merchant partnerships, trading incentives for routing preference, that is a different strategy. It's all contemplated in the guidance that we've given you for '12. But it's 2 different strategies with the network participation fee and the introduction of lower variable transaction cost being a separate pricing strategy, all contained within the guidance we gave for 2012 .\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Kissane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJames Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch: Just another question on the network participation. Do you have a sense on what portion Visa will directly negotiate with merchants and what portion will be negotiated by the acquirers? And will merchants be able to opt out if they don't want to go along with the program and stick with the old variable structure?\nJoseph Saunders: I'll leave the financials to Byron, but as it relates to an opt out, they can opt out if they don't want to accept Visa cards.\nByron Pollitt: And yes, we do. It is -- we have a sense as to the proportions. That's part of the scenarios that we have run. For competitive reasons, of course, you wouldn't expect us to be very specific on the call, so I will honor that expectation and not be.\nJoseph Saunders: Yes. And let me go back and just remind everyone that this fixed fee that you're talking about is not a fee that sits on top of what merchants are paying. It is part of what we consider to be a reduction in the fees that merchants will pay.\nByron Pollitt: And I...\nJoseph Saunders: I think that's extraordinarily important because to mischaracterize it would be a mistake and a disservice.\nByron Pollitt: And I would add, Jim, that the -- when Joe said earlier the strategies in part intended to honor kind of the spirit of the new regs, this will allow merchants to begin realizing more economies of scale on the incremental transactions as they grow their volumes. And we thought that that was an important design element of the pricing structure going forward. And so the notion of introducing a fixed component, having a lower variable and then allowing the variable to be the one in play as merchants grow their volume honors one of the objectives of this regulation.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.\nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Byron, just a clarification. Just a second ago, you said that this would apply to all products. Did you mean credit and debit products? Or did you just mean all debit products?\nByron Pollitt: No, all products. So the fee -- to pay the fee is -- makes you eligible to use -- to accept credit, debit, prepaid, all Visa products.\nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Got it. Okay, great. And just out of curiosity, in the rollout of India, you talked about 1 million debit cards being issued. I'm just curious on form factor there in terms of choice. Why not having gone to something more like mobile or some alternative technology, I guess, relative to classic at this point?\nByron Pollitt: Yes, there's some history there in the Indian market. We are absolutely going to mobile in India. But there initially, we are solving for cards that are PIN-enabled and that have standardized protocols that will allow broad-based acceptance and it addresses some historical issues in the India market. But this is in no way a substitute for mobile, which we view as a very important form factor to penetrate the vast majority of locations in India since it is very unlikely they would ever be able to support the fiber-optic infrastructure that more developed countries have developed overtime.\nOperator: Next question comes from Robert Dodd, Morgan Keegan.\nRobert Dodd - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: Just again seeking on the NCSA, how confident are you in your reporting ability to track the number of locations? If we look at the PCI DSS data you've given us in the past, the number of Tier 1 merchants that you disclosed has always been something of an estimate. I mean, so is there going to be a -- necessitate a change in recording from acquirers or anything like that for you to be able to extract the number of locations to appropriately levy the fee?\nByron Pollitt: The short answer is, yes, but we have researched this significantly, understand what the changes would be, have solutions to make those happen and are comfortable that this can be done in a relatively straightforward way within the timeframe contemplated.\nOperator: Next question comes from Tim Willi with wells Fargo.\nTimothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Just a question on sort of thinking about routing preference and minimizing some, I believe, end market share. To what degree do you think that the market share you currently possess and maybe the touch points of data and scale between the Signature business and Interlink affords you a competitive advantage around cost or the data and value that you've talked about in terms of building additional products versus what might be at the disposal of the competition if they decide to employ the same type of strategy?\nByron Pollitt: So I don't think there's any question. With our installed base, we have a highly, highly competitive cost position. With the data that we process, we are very well-positioned in order to add value-added services. And with regards to routing preference, given our market position, we have assumed, as I said earlier in our guidance, that some of the volume is at risk. It's contained in our guidance, more PIN and Signature, and that there is -- and our guidance assumes that there would be some conversion of Signature to PIN. So our guidance is based on those assumptions. Having said that, we feel very well-positioned to compete for transactions. The one change in the environment that we are sensitive to is that 2 unaffiliated networks need to be on those cards. And a meaningful number of our cards today are Visa branded on the front, Interlink on the back. And so we are mindful of that situation, mindful that we will -- that puts us in a different competitive position in the post-Durbin world. And those -- these -- that is the set of circumstances our strategies are aimed to address.\nJoseph Saunders: In general, we think that our clients', that our infrastructure, that our recent announcements on e-commerce and the wallet capabilities that we're developing among a number of other things put us in a very, very, very strong position, which is not to say that there won't be competition and it's not to say that we're not mindful of what other people can do. We think that we have the largest market share because we have executed better than anyone else. I think that we have shown an ability to operate in front of the market. I don't see any reason why that should change. We will be diligent in that regard, and we will be mindful of the competition. And we have thought long and hard about all of that in delivering our guidance.\nOperator: The last question comes from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I was wondering, are you planning to offer a new pricing structure and network participation fee in any markets outside the U.S. at this point?\nJoseph Saunders: Not at this point.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And then could you just clarify 2 things? One, what the impact of gasoline prices was on spending in the last quarter and through July; and then just on the United agreement, what happens to the existing Continental cards when they expire? Or after the merger, what happens when somebody grabs a Continental card with another brand on it?\nJoseph Saunders: We've asked -- you've asked a number of -- do you want to answer the gasoline one, Byron?\nByron Pollitt: Yes, well, the gasoline -- well, actually, we can get back to you on the actual impacts. We do have a phenomena that, when looking at the payment value -- payment volume trends, that once pricing gets much above, I think $3 approaching $4 a gallon, you begin seeing a switch from debit to credit. And so we're starting to see some of that, and some of that switch may come back the other way if prices drop. But largely, what we're seeing is a somewhat higher percentage on credit and debit to gasoline with no immediate trade out on other expenditures that's particularly noticeable. So that's it on gasoline, and...\nJoseph Saunders: It does not, in aggregate, add at least significant amount to our growth.\nByron Pollitt: Yes, and we've made no explicit assumptions with regards to the impact of gasoline plus or minus in next year's -- with regards to next year's guidance. On United Continental, all new cards under the new plan will be issued Visa. And then the existing cards -- well, the way that we articulate this is the deal is focused on the new issuance. And we get 100% of the new issuance given the effective date of the contract going forward.\nJoseph Saunders: Cards outstanding will be reissued as they are -- must a consumer, of course.\nJack Carsky: All right. Thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has nay follow-up questions, feel free to give Victoria or myself a call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. This call has concluded.

And as always, thanks to all of you for joining us today. Visa delivered another quarter of solid financial performance posting net operating revenue of over $2.2 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. As has been the case for over a year now, these revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payment volume, cross-border volume, and Visa-processed transactions from across the globe.  Notably, 62% of our total revenue growth came from outside the United States, getting us progressively closer to our stated objective of having our business outside the United States represent more than 1/2 of our revenue by fiscal 2015.  Net income for the quarter were $881 million, a 23% increase over the prior year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.23, a 28% increase over the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, we effectively repurchased an additional $630 million worth of shares nearly exhausting our $1 billion authorization first announced at the beginning of this fiscal year.  Given that, and recognizing our ongoing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, today, we're pleased to announce that our Board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. This brings our total amounts of repurchases in fiscal 2011 to $2.8 billion. Byron will provide some additional detail on the specifics of the activity.  Before covering some of the business highlights from the quarter, I'd like to first address the ongoing legislative dialogue in Washington in the industry's efforts to address the Durbin Bill. Reiterating what I said on last quarters call, since the introduction of the Durbin amendment, Visa has worked with the industry to help educate legislators on the unintended consequences of this piece of legislation. And our efforts are gaining increasing traction.  As you know, Senators Tester and Carter have introduced legislation calling for a delay in the study of the Durbin Bill. The Senators' efforts have generated support from a large, growing and diverse group of individuals and organizations who are concerned about the unintended, anticonsumer consequences of debit regulation. We believe strongly that Congress should examine what the real impact of this regulation will be on consumers, the financial institutions that serve them, the payment system and the economy as a whole. This would be the reasonable and rational course of action. To that end, we are hopeful that the Senate will consider Senators Tester and Corker's Bill in the very near future.  That said, no matter what happens with Durbin, we will continue to compete in and lead the U.S. electronic payments market, and be a growth company for years to come.  I'll now turn to Business Developments from the past quarter that underscore our focus on driving global revenue growth today, while also setting the stage for future growth through new and innovative ways to pay. As ever, our strong relationships with clients continue to help drive our success. In addition to delivering solid financial gains in the second fiscal quarter, we were successful in advancing our strategy of growing and protecting our core business through key wins and relationship renewals with financial institutions and merchants.  First, we grew our core issuance business with several important new deals. For example, in India, we've made significant strides in expanding our business with the State Bank of India. We signed a multiyear deal to issue Visa debit products across the SBI franchise, whereas until now the bank's business was entirely with our competitor. Nearly 500,000 Visa cards have been issued since March, and we expect several million to be issued within the first year of the program with significant runway beyond that.  This new win is in addition to the joint venture we already have in the works with SBI and Elavon to terminalize major metropolitan areas of the country. We also recently signed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with HSBC, covering most of our Latin America and Caribbean region that will considerably broaden our issuance with HSBC in this part of the world.  This builds upon the long-term issuing relationship we have had with HSBC globally for many years. And in the U.S., we expanded our credit program portfolio with a new 7-year program with U.S. Bank and Kroger, one of the largest grocery retailers in the U.S., which will begin converting to Visa in September.  We also strengthened several relationships with longtime key issuing clients in the U.S. Most recently, we resigned Regions Bank to a multiyear credit debit agreement to include signature debit, interlink, and some processing services. Regions is a top 10 debit issuer in the U.S. and a longtime client of Visa.  We also continue to see good traction on the prepaid front in the U.S. with our state government programs. We recently initiated unemployment insurance programs in Connecticut with Chase, and in Florida, with Wells Fargo. On that subject, our unemployment programs with the Bank of America in New Jersey and California are ramping up at a very nice pace. Importantly though, we are seeing increasing use of these cards at the point of sale versus cash withdrawals at the ATM, as consumers get more comfortable with this form of prepaid product.  Beyond working with our financial institution and merchant clients to expand issuance and acceptance of our core products, we also continue to look ahead and develop new channels and form factors to diversify the utility of these products.  For instance in the mobile space, we just announced our realtime messaging service with our first client, the GAP. This service allows merchants to send realtime location-based discounts and promotions to consumers via text message. In this case, consumers can opt into the GAP Mobile for You program to receive GAP discounts that are triggered when they conduct a qualified Visa transaction, which they can choose to redeem at a GAP store while they are out shopping. GAP was the first national retailer to test and rollout realtime messaging and we have a strong pipeline of other retailers to follow.  This is an excellent example of a value-added service that supports merchants' desires to personalize the consumer shopping experience made possible by the realtime processing capabilities and unparalleled data from our Visa Net processing infrastructure.  Equally important is the legislation has not delayed, RTM along with other offerings such as CyberSource's enhanced decision manager, which I'll talk about in a moment, are the types of Visa value-added services that would incent merchants to route transactions over Visa Net.  In the area of person-to-person payments, we continue to make important strides in leveraging our network and significant card base to enable people to pay each other using Visa cards. Our recent announcement with CashEdge and Fiserv in the U.S. underscores one of the important ways we are accelerating growth in this area. Increasingly by working with partners like these, we have existing distribution channels, we can broaden the reach and ease of use of the prepayment programs of Visa products.  A recent example of one of these P2P programs overseas involves a service we recently launched in Russia and the Ukraine. We are working with Kiwi, Russia's largest payment kiosk operator, First Processing Bank in Russia, and PrivatBank, the Ukraine's largest bank. Together, we are enabling domestic transfers within Russia and with the cross-border functionality between Visa account holders in the U.K. and Russia. Over time, we will partner with additional entities to expand these programs globally.  On the eCommerce front, we closed the PlaySpan the acquisition on March 1. In the meantime, we have seen CyberSource's business continue to grow rapidly and gain increasing traction in the marketplace. During the quarter, CyberSource delivered 38% billable transaction growth and secured a number of new business wins with major merchants including IDS, America and Olympus America. I also want to point out one or more of the recent examples of the synergies we are finding with CyberSource that deliver tangible value to our global merchant base.  This quarter, we combined the strength of Visa and CyberSource's individual fraud detection capabilities to launch our first iteration of enhanced decision manager, which I mentioned earlier. By combining the risk force that CyberSource has historically provided to its merchants clients with data from the Visa Inc. advanced authorization service, we are delivering a unique and unparalleled view of transaction data that merchant clients recognize will serve them as a powerful new fraud detection mechanism for their business.  All of these advancements are important steps towards capturing the enormous opportunity we see ahead, with payments innovation fueling our business growth over the moderate to long term. All of us know the way people connect and transact across the globe is changing dramatically driven by 2 global forces. First, the continued secular shift from paper base to electronic payments that still largely occurs at the physical point of sale, and second, the widespread adoption of mobile and Internet technology. These forces our conversion, and consumers and merchants are looking for payment solutions that harness these technologies. To that end, we have been working hard to develop a Visa quality payment solution that brings reliability, security and convenience to mobile and eCommerce environments.  In our view, a globally viable payment solution must have 5 fundamental characteristics: convenience and simplicity, standardization, interoperability, global accessibility and security. None of the solutions we have seen from competitors is comprehensive enough because they don't address all of these criteria at once. Visa has long delivered solutions at the physical point of sale that passed this test and we are applying the same standard in the online and mobile arena.  Look for us to make an announcement of our global eCommerce and mobile strategy later this month. And now, over to Byron.\nByron Pollitt: Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 15% net revenue growth was broad based, with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 21% growth rate in rest of world. As Joe mentioned earlier, over 60% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means non-U.S. revenue is now 45% of Visa's total.  Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 5 consecutive quarters of year-over-year positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of February and March both comped at 11%, which is the first time we have seen double-digit growth since the recession. We are clearly encouraged by this trend. Third call out relates to client incentives. Incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue was 16.7%, up from 15.3% in the first quarter. Taken together, incentives as a percent of gross revenue was 16% for the first half of the fiscal year, at the low end of our guidance. While we still expect client incentives to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% for fiscal 2011, if implementation of the Durbin amendment is not delayed beyond July, it is probable that we would see some upward pressure on this number as a result of potential actions we would take to mitigate volume loss with certain issuers and merchants.  Fourth call out relates to Durbin. Whether the legislation gets delayed or not, we still expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and earnings per share growth of greater than 20%. Finally, it's worth noting that beginning with the second fiscal quarter, our 3 key revenue drivers are now growing at double-digit rates, while comping double-digit growth in the same quarter of the prior year. This is true both globally and for the U.S., indicating that the strength of the recovery is now more broad based.  Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for the December and March quarters, as well as more recent payment and transaction results for the entire month of April. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal year 2011.  Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 13%, a modest decline from the 15% growth we saw in the December quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the March quarter figures. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 12%, relatively flat from the December quarter. Rest of World payment volume on a constant dollar basis, grew at 15%, down 2 points from the 17% rate in the December quarter.  More recently, in the month of April, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 11%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the second quarter, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth to be higher than the U.S.'s 11%. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the March quarter, down slightly from a 15% rate in the December quarter. There was notable drop off in inbound travel to Japan, Middle East and North Africa. In aggregate, these situations may have negatively impacted growth by about 50 basis points. In April, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 13%.  Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12 billion in the fiscal second quarter, a 13% increase over the year ago period and modestly behind the 15% growth rate we saw in the December quarter. In April, processed transactions posted growth of 12%. CyberSource billable transactions totaled just over $1 billion for the quarter, a very strong 38% growth rate over the same period a year ago.  We continue to expect strong results in this part of our business as eCommerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally.  Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal second quarter, gross revenue of $2.7 billion was up 16% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.2 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year, driven by a sustained economic recovery, previously enacted pricing changes and cross-border transaction growth.  Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 24% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter and the impact of pricing adjustments.  Data processing revenue was $823 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transaction. As expected and discussed previously, data processing revenue growth has moderated due to the impact of key contract renewals 2 quarters ago, and by the prospective removal of certain offsetting Gateway pass-through revenue and expense.  International transaction revenue was up 14% to $624 million due to the sustained improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. As I mentioned, client incentive as a percent of gross revenue came in at 16.7% and are running at 16% fiscal year-to-date, on track with expectations. Approximately 65% of the year-over-year dollar increase in incentives is due to payment volume growth in client portfolio, about another 25% of the increase is due to non-U.S. client renewals.  Total operating expense for the quarter was $862 million, up 3% from the prior year. Increases in personnel, professional fees and general and administrative expense were offset by lower marketing in the period. Additionally, and I'll continue to remind you of this for the next 2 quarters, recall that we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass through activity.  As a result, $55 million of revenue and expense, which was booked in Q2 fiscal year 2010 did not reoccur in Q2 fiscal year 2011. In Q2, this represented 3 percentage points of revenue growth. For the remainder of the year, these changes in presentation will continue to be earnings neutral, and will affect revenue growth.  The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the second fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity and contributed a positive 2% increase compared to the same prior year period. While our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, please note that we expect to aggressively fund important long-term investments across our entire business.  Capital expenditures was $72 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. Lastly, the PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. And we anticipate a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.04 for the full 2011 fiscal year.  Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investments of $6.6 billion. Of this total, $3 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the remaining 3 quarters with $2.7 billion uncommitted as of the end of the second quarter.  In terms of our ongoing buyback, at the end of the quarter, we announced the prefunding of the litigation escrow by $400 million to be funded with cash previously designated for our $1 billion share repurchase. This was executed at an average price of $73.81 per share. Additionally, we repurchased $230 million of our shares in the open market during the quarter at an average price of $70.53 per share. All told, we effectively repurchased 8.7 million shares at an average price of $73.58. This leaves us with $64 million of open to buy under the original program.  At the end of the quarter, we had 704 million shares outstanding on an as-converted basis. And importantly, the A class now accounts for almost 75% of our outstanding shares. Management remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And through this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion repurchase plan, which we will execute at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa.  As to guidance, for the balance of 2011, given the results to date, we are not making any adjustments at this time. With or without a Durbin delay, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and EPS growth of better than 20%. Once the timing and content of the Reformed Act Regulations are clarified, we will determine whether any 2011 guidance requires adjustment, such as client incentives, and we will consider providing an early earnings outlook for fiscal 2012.  In summary, we expect Visa to remain a solid growth company for years to come. Our core businesses continue to grow at healthy rates, while we are aggressively investing in technologies and platforms that will extend our core payment and processing capabilities, thereby creating new sources of growth.  Finally, we expect to deliver this growth while driving significant free cash flow, which we will use to enhance shareholder returns through a continued dividend increases and share repurchases.  And with that, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bruce Harting with Barclays Capital.\nBruce Harting - Barclays Capital: With 60% of growth coming from Rest of World, I'm just trying to circle the next time you have an earnings announcement, hopefully, we'll know one way or another the outcome of the fed decision and whether it's stalled or not. But is it one way to look at it of $2.2 billion of net revenue this quarter, I figure about 10% given your previous numbers came from issuers at U.S. debit, so call that maybe $200 million. And in theory if that were reduced say, 20% just to pick a number or maybe worst case, or $40 million a quarter, the other $2 billion of revenue is growing faster as you said with 60% of revenue growth coming from Rest of World, particularly strong in credit given that credit is much larger Rest of the World than debit. Is it one way to look at it and say that, that other $2 billion of revenue not impacted by Durbin growing say, 15% would more than offset say, the $40 million decline and the $200 million of U.S. debit coming from issuers. Is that one way to try to size this in the second half if we get a worst case?\nByron Pollitt: Without confirming any of the numbers, I think the mindset that we are conveying and you're picking up is that with that 45% of our net revenue in the quarter is now coming from outside the U.S. That revenue this quarter, grew at 21%, twice what the growth rate is of the U.S. at '10. And we were particularly pleased to see that this is the fifth straight quarter of positive payment volume growth in U.S. credit. And so, within the U.S. portfolio, which is being outgrown by Rest of World, credit is beginning to take a stronger presence and thereby putting debit in a different financial perspective than it was say, 12 months ago. So I think that thesis is exactly what we were trying to convey on the call. Thank you for asking.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Joe, I guess I want to ask you, I guess you're teasing us a little bit here with the eCommerce mobile strategy announcement later this month, is there anyway you can elaborate on that further? And I guess, I'd also ask if you can update us on your willingness to work with I'll call it, non-bank partners in the U.S., names like Isis, which I believe is now opening things up outside of Discover?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, I can't really expand on the first point because as I suggested, we're going to make an announcement and we'll begin with something in the middle to the end of next week. And so, you're going to have to hold off for a few days or several days in that regard. As it relates to the second part of the question, obviously, one of the things that we're looking at is opening up new and different sources of revenue. And that would suggest that we'll be working with different types of entities and we have pretty much exquisitely worked with before. Having said that, I want to make perfectly clear, we're not going to do this at the expense of our primary customers and financial institutions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Frisch with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Frisch - Morgan Stanley: I want to address the 8 online in the quarter because all the calls that I'm getting post their releases is on this. And I know Byron, you went through the details. It was based on the accounting changes around extras and no Olympics this year and so forth. But just to set an apples-to-apples basis, what would the year-over-year EPS compare have been? And as a follow-on, you said that you will continually invest in growth initiatives with the margins of 62%. Does that mean they're not sustainable at current levels?\nByron Pollitt: So on the first one, I think what you're asking, Adam, on marketing is because we took the Visa extras out of the expense base going forward, does that have a P&L impact? Is that the question? Because the revenue came out equal to the expenses, so while marketing is down and it is down in part because of the removal of Extras and also because of timing, the full year impact of the change that we made with Visa Extras is income statement neutral. So no impact on EPS, and no impact on the full year guidance for marketing because when we guided, while marketing is down versus the same quarter last year, there's always, given the campaign that we have last year relative to the Olympics, you would naturally expect it to be down somewhat. So we are still fully consistent with the guidance that we gave earlier on marketing. And the adjustments we made for Extras no income statement impact. With regards to the margin at 62 for the quarter, that would be -- what you should take away is that we are increasingly investing in our products platforms to drive future growth. And the margin will simply be an outcome of the level of investment that we make and we continue to invest aggressively in that arena.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.\nDaniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: I had a question as it pertains to watching inflation, gas prices and food. I wanted to know what really has been your experience, where in a certain I guess, friction points or price levels, which could impact your transaction growth relative to what you guys get from higher average ticket prices? And then, are you really concerned at current levels? Or would you be concerned if these levels, where kind of held up for a long period of time?\nByron Pollitt: This is Byron. Let me give you a few -- a little bit of factual perspective first. With regards -- let's talk about this in the context of the U.S. So for gas, historically, go back a year. At gas prices that we're roughly 30% less than they average, on average than they are today, we were running about 8% of total U.S. payment volume in the gas category. We refer to it as oil, in the oil category. In the month of April, that was just a little over 10% of U.S. payment volume, suggesting that the share had moved up about -- that's about a 25% increase in the share of U.S. payment volume. When you compare that to roughly based on our measures of 32% increase in the average price of gasoline, April versus about where we were a year ago, and you factor in that there is probably been some degree of consumption cutback given prices that are now posted in the $4-plus range. That is the immediate impact. We have not yet seen and it may be a bit early, we have not yet seen any specific call outs relative to trade outs on other spending categories, which may be in part due to the additional disposable income created by reductions in withholding tax and social security. So we're still trying to sort that out. Inevitably, there is probably going to be some friction. But at the moment, it's hard for us to identify it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Byron, if we operate under the assumption that indeed, Durbin is not delayed, and as you said, you would adjust incentives to maintain volume, should we think about that, first of all, I'm assuming what you're saying is you'd be above the high end of the 16.5% range you set. And second, would that effectively be a onetime event concentrated in the second half of '11 and then you'd go back to more normalized levels in the future? Or is that a structurally higher level of volumes to support incentives in your view?\nByron Pollitt: Let me deal with the first part of your question. We've delivered the first 6 months at 16% incentives as a percent of gross. And our guidance was 16% to 16.5%. That 16% to 16.5% guidance did assume that Durbin would not be delayed, that we would have some impact of Durbin before the end of the year and we provided for some degree of incentives in the event that, that were to happen. Without knowing the exact timing, without knowing exactly how the rules will be promulgated, without knowing the timing, the implementation timing associated with those rules, those are some pretty big wildcards with regards to the incentives that we may or may not be putting on the table this fiscal year. And therefore, we were drawing attention to the fact that we've got a year in the bag at 16, but there's some significant uncertainties still to go. But some of those uncertainties we're contemplated. So don't automatically assume that were it to be -- were it not to be delayed that we would necessarily be above that range. But where we end up is going to be a function of the timing and the exact wording of the rules. And I would say on the second, it's just hard to know with regards to how we would be deploying incentives today versus how we would do it under Durbin. The notion that incentives would be in play I think is a fair assumption. To what degree whether it be onetime, sustained. I think it will be -- once we understand better the environment ahead, we'll be much better able to opine on that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.\nDavid Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Guys, I was just wondering if the acceleration in credit growth is just all being driven by just consumer preferences as maybe their incomes arise et cetera? Or if there's some external push from the banks that are just starting to push credit over debit or just deemphasizing debit?\nByron Pollitt: Credit is typically much more discretionary in its use. And therefore, we have continued to see very strong debit growth, which is more nondiscretionary. As the economy recovers, our belief is that consumers in combination with more employment, become more willing to spend on the discretionary side. From what we can see, this is still concentrated in the high-income segment of the market, but driven by more discretionary spend and not coming at the expense of debit at this point.\nOperator: Next question comes from David Hochstim, Buckingham Research.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Could you just give us maybe a better stance of how much deconversions affected the revenue and payments growth metrics this quarter, if we look at year-over-year comparisons this quarter versus the December quarter?\nByron Pollitt: We are -- we don't actually guide to or disclose what the actual impacts are. But it is a -- conversions are accretive for us through this fiscal year. And we can address that again with fiscal year '12 coming up when we talk about our guidance for that time period at the end of the year. We'll address conversions or deconversions at that point. But it should be accretive in each quarter for the balance of this fiscal year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citi.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc: Joe, as you look at markets such as Asia, I mean there's clearly a very strong growth trajectory. I was curious on the headwind side, I mean, how do you feel about the competitive sort of landscape from a regional network perspective. We talked to some folks over there, and it seems like they are continuing to be pretty active?\nJoseph Saunders: There's a lot of competitive activity that is different in Asia than in the United States. I mean there's China UnionPay, there's JCB, there's national payment system considerations. And so there's a lot going on. But we've been doing business around the world in a lengthy period of time, we've had people on the ground for decades in most of these countries. And the fact that these economies are emerging, and that electronic payment mechanisms are becoming more and more prevalent, we continue to have a huge opportunity almost everywhere in the world. Now I'm not being dismissive about the competition that we face. I mean obviously, there are areas of the world like China where we can't do business domestically. But I don't think that -- I think that our numbers would suggest to you that we're doing quite well in increasing our volumes in Asia and other parts of Latin America and other regions outside the United States. And so, I'm pretty bullish on where we'll be on the next few years in that regard.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.\nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Byron, maybe just sort of horn in a little bit on sort of the confidence to grow through Durbin, as we think about that longer term, is it the volume growth outside of the U.S., some of the mitigation strategies that you're talking about, what gives you guys the confidence? Or is it a combination of all of the above? You guys have the visibility on obviously, where the growth of the business is? But maybe anyway to sort of hone in on how you're think about the mitigation efforts themselves in terms of post-Durbin world et cetera?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, it would be -- this is Joe. It would be kind of silly for me to sit here and tell you exactly what we're going to do, because it clearly has something to do with the competition in the event that the rules change. But we certainly haven't been passive as it relates to understanding what the various implications and scenarios could be coming out of Durbin, whether it is delayed or it isn't delayed, what the final links from the fed would be. And so each of those cases, we have a different set of mitigation tactics that we would intend to use. I mean, obviously, we'll be doing some things that we would intend to do across the board regardless of how things developed. But our suggesting to you that we're comfortable, that we are going to be valuable and a company predicated on confidence that we have as it relates to what we do. If that's sufficiently vague, I'm sorry.\nOperator: The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Maybe just a follow-up on that Joe, some of the things that would mitigate the effects on you wouldn't necessarily even be things that you would do, you might help them. But I was wondering about the idea of how much do you think of debit volume could be shifted either in more upscale customers up to credit or downscale customers to reloadable prepaid that would have kind of better economics for the issuer and for yourself as well? And would Visa be advantaged in that just because you tend to be partnered with the banks that have more robust credit card platforms like JPMorgan and BofA?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, yes. I mean I don't -- your logic is good and then also [indiscernible] space is a significant investment. I can't tell you, it's hard to judge what percentage of debit a volume could move up or down in the way that you're suggesting. But I don't certainly wouldn't be saying anything out of score or giving away any secrets if I suggested that there isn't a bank in the United States that isn't.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: Yesterday, on First Data's earnings call, they have mentioned making significant investment in dynamic routing, whether that's premature or not depends on the Durbin delay or not. But I wanted to get your thoughts on the prospect of dynamic routing at the acquirer level and whether that would create a price war at the merchant level for debit?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, I mean, look, if this gets back into what are the mitigation tactics that we're going to use, and I understand what FDR thinks, and I understand that they're probably excited about the potential from their point of view. But frankly, I'm as excited about what we can do as they are about what they can do. And I'm really quite prepared to do what I need to do to compete with FDR. And at the risk of sounding -- let's not -- I'm not being flippant. I'm just -- I have a considerably hide the real confidence that we'll be just fine.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: It makes sense that you have your incentives outlook and your 2012 outlook essentially on hold until we get clarity on the fed's debit rules. But I'm wondering if you could give us a way to dimension the percentage of your U.S. revenues that are attached to clients, where your incentive agreement would need to be altered if the fed chooses either alternative A or alternative B, under the no network exclusivity provision. In other words, how much of your U.S. revenue mix is subject to incentive agreement modifications under the Durbin amendment, if in the long run, recognizing that Durbin's timing is very unknown?\nByron Pollitt: Rod, let me try and be helpful in putting some perspective with 2 observations. The first one of which, since we're not going to specifically talk about revenue in the context that you asked. We're already public that roughly a little over 50% of cards are issued in the U.S., where Interlink is exclusive on the bank, number one. In the debit, where Interlink is exclusive on the bank. Second, we have also said on a number of occasions that most of our contracts are set up with incentive arrangements that are tied to volume. And so, we will naturally at our impetus, want to revisit a number of those contracts to make sure that the incentives are structured in a way that makes sense given the legal environment that we will be under post-Durbin. I can't think of very many contracts at all that require us, because of the legislation to revisit the contract. We're going to want to in order to adjust the incentives so that it is a win-win for both us and the financial institution.\nOperator: The next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: So Byron, I'm just going to just improvise here in light of your response to that prior question which was intriguing. I just want to kind of reiterate what it is that you have addressed so far with regard to volume and et cetera. So you have said that you're 16.5% for this year had contemplated already some impact from Durbin, but the comment you just made suggested that perhaps volume and incentive would be in your interest to reduce in fiscal '12, should Durbin actually proceed? Am I misinterpreting that comment?\nByron Pollitt: Yes, you're misinterpreting. The incentive contracts that we have in place -- most of them are based on volume growth. And if the routing provisions go into place, where the financial institution potentially has less influence over the actual routing, we just have to look at the incentive provisions to make sure that they are reflective of the way the operating environment will conduct itself under legislation.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Mammone with Deutsche Bank.\nChristopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank AG: Just wondering, I know it's small, I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the PlaySpan acquisition. And we know the digital gaming category is displaying pretty explosive growth, so just any color on earliest thought and the strategy there as you layer in that platform? And then maybe as a quick follow-up, was there anything to call up in volumes, Byron, regarding the Easter shift?\nByron Pollitt: On the Easter shift, I would say there might be -- that one's hard for us. There might be a little noise in April, but we've got a pretty diversified portfolio. And so I don't think there's really a call out April and May. Early days on PlaySpan. Joe, do you want to, I think we just completed the acquisition. So we're fast integrating it and that may be...\nJoseph Saunders: It will play a role beyond the gaming space and our strategic direction, which we will kind of an add for next week, so which will be much more apparent next week when we make an announcement.\nOperator: The next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen.\nMoshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC: Byron, can you comment on the expected timeframes for contract renewals with some of the maybe top 5 or maybe top 10 banks, and how much flexibility do you have in trying to modify some of those contract terms long before some of those contracts expire obviously, specifically we've been focusing on what you were saying regarding rebates et cetera?\nByron Pollitt: Yes, there are no top 5 contracts scheduled for renewal, I want to say, for a good 18 months or more. We do from time to time, when the opportunity is attractive, we will look at early renewals. But in terms of major contract renewals, at the end of last year, we pretty much cleared the decks and don't expect, we have no scheduled major renewals for at least another 18 months.\nJoseph Saunders: And we just announced Regions today.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: Joe, I know you're not going to give -- there's a lot more data coming next week. But I was hoping you might be able to give a little more color on -- like with the Visa announcement here leading us to tonight, for next week. Is it going to be something that is comprehensive with other joint ventures combined that is like live business? Is it something that's incremental? I mean maybe a little bit more color to help prepare us for next week?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, I think that what I said earlier was that we recognize that as time moves on that mobile and eCommerce technology are going to consume a greater role in the electronic payments arena. And if we are going to remain as a viable player as we are today then we are going to have to be out in front as it relates to interoperability, simplicity, security and factors of that nature. So we have been paying attention to that, the acquisitions that we have made, that in the back of our mind. And we have a strategy both in the United States and other mature economies in a different strategy in different parts of the world, where there are emerging economies that depend more on technology. So it is kind of bringing that together, the way that we think about that. What we've done, what we have ready to induce and what we will be contemplating doing as time moves on. So our point of view, it's significant and from our point of view, it is -- we are better than any in the competition that we think we have to deal with, has been because our solution is a more complete solution than what we've seen in the market before. And so we've been reluctant to talk about it until we have put together and put together in an appropriate where we can tell you something positive and significant. And we can talk about how it all comes together. So that's where we are.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bill Carcache with Macquarie.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: There has been some recent announcements that suggests that EMV is gaining traction in the U.S. Can you talk about whether you're seeing that and share your thoughts what that would mean for Visa?\nJoseph Saunders: Chips, it is gaining traction and we've supported it. We've made an announcement several months ago as it related to our support globally. We didn't encourage it in the U.S. There have been a lot of things going on as you are probably aware like the [indiscernible] acting, the Durbin acting. Distracting to issuers in the United States. But for cards to be global, chips are going to play a role and we encourage moving the chip technology. We don't necessarily encourage them into pins and chips. We encourage moving to chips and other forms of identification or authentication than what exist, have existed here before. We don't believe that contact with chips would become something that is ubiquitous within the point of sale marketplace in the United States in the near future. We didn't know that there will be specific things to which it is applicable and for which it will be used, but it won't necessarily be widespread tomorrow or the next day or in 2012, 2013.\nOperator: And the last question does come from Jim Kissane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJames Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch: Joe, do you think the economics with mobile would be better, worse, or the same, compared with plastic today, given that there's any carriers involved, handset manufacturers involved, potentially technology companies?\nJoseph Saunders: I think we have a terrific opportunity in mobile technology. And I did mention answering one or the other questions, I believe that, we believe that not only, well, as it relates to the technology and just payments in general, we do believe that there are other sources of revenue that will be made available to us that are not now, that takes our CyberSource acquisition or PlaySpan acquisition, and other things what we've done and when we put it altogether we're pretty excited about the revenue that can come out of this in the future. Now let me caution you. I'm not talking about the spike in revenue in 2012. I mean this isn't something that happens overnight. It's something that evolves. But as I sit here and look at Visa and I look at our sources of revenue and our growth, I have to anticipate what is going to be fueling that growth 3 years from now, 4 years from now, not just what's going to happen next week. And so I think that what we're going to talk about next week, the way we're putting things together. And mobile technology in particular will be something that we'll be happy -- excited to be involved in as time moves on.\nJack Carsky: Well, that ends it. Thank you all very much for joining us today. And if anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to give myself or Victoria a call.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. The call has concluded.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe\nJoseph Saunders: Thanks, Jack, and as always, thanks to all of you for joining us today. Visa began fiscal 2011 with another very strong quarter, delivering net operating revenues of over $2.2 billion, a 14% increase over last year. As has been the case for several quarters now, these revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payments volume, cross border volume and Visa-processed transactions from across the globe.  Net income for the quarter was $884 million, a 16% increase over the prior year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.23, a 20% increase over the first quarter of 2010. As previously reported, early in October, we funded the litigation escrow by an additional $800 million, which has the same effect as the share repurchase. Later that month, our board authorized a $1 billion repurchase program, which we actively executed upon during the first quarter by buying over $300 million worth of shares. So we're off to a good start in terms of returning excess cash to our shareholders. Byron will provide more additional detail on the repurchase.  Nearly one year ago at Visa's inaugural Investor Day, we laid out our long-term strategy that would drive continued revenue growth. Key to this strategy is maintaining a dual focus on growing usage of our core products, which drives the majority of our revenue today while simultaneously advancing an aggressive innovation agenda to accelerate long-term growth through new platforms and channels.  During that same event, we also made a commitment to further diversify our business, including a long-term goal of ensuring our revenues more fully reflect Visa's global presence. We continue to make steady progress on achieving our aspiration of having more than 50% of revenue come from outside the United States by 2015.  Consistent with that objective, in this quarter, just over 60% of total revenue growth came from Rest of World. VisaNet is the key asset that enables Visa to deliver on these innovations and revenue diversity commitments. As we invest in long-term growth initiatives, we will maintain the unmatched scale, reliability, security and convenience that we deliver today. Our competitive advantages in this regard are significant. VisaNet's processing infrastructure is unparalleled in its capabilities, enabling us to deploy those assets and drive more volume and more value to networks and its participants.  Importantly, the flexibility of VisaNet allows us to lead the evolution of our industry towards payment into new technologies and form factors that will spur the future growth of this industry. To illustrate that point, I'd like to provide you with our most recent updates on key initiatives.  First, we will look at eCommerce and Money Transfer, two critical channels to driving usage of our products. Growing our eCommerce business remains a top priority for Visa and will be an area of increased emphasis in fiscal 2011. Our investments in this category to date are yielding results as we saw 25% year-over-year growth in eCommerce payments volume globally in Q1.  CyberSource enables us to accelerate growth of the eCommerce category overall by extending Visa's capability to deliver innovation to merchants, consumers and partners with services such as fraud management and payment security management. CyberSource got off to a great start in 2011, delivering 40% year-over-year growth in billable transactions in the first quarter.  We have also made progress in driving future growth by continuing to expand merchant relationships with new wins such as Hertz and Tommy Hilfiger. We also signed up LAN Airlines thanks to a lead from our Visa LAC team that demonstrates the synergies that exist for building the business through shared lead generation.  We've also begun making targeted investments to expand CyberSource's international footprint, including adding personnel to our existing office in Singapore, establishing a legal entity in Brazil and assessing the landscape in our CEMEA region. While the international build out will take time, we are excited about the opportunities for growth.  Money Transfer is an example of our commitment to leading the evolution in payments, giving consumers a new channel to use their credit, debit and prepaid products. In fact, today, I'm pleased to announce substantial progress on that front.  We have expanded our partnership with MoneyGram to introduce the first cash-to-Visa account program for remittances from the United States to Mexico, which according to the World Bank is the largest remittances corridor in the world. Utilizing the strength of our global network, this program allows consumers in the U.S. to visit any of the 35,000 MoneyGram locations to send funds directly to any Visa credit, debit or prepaid account in Mexico in a fast, secure, reliable and cost-effective way.  Money Transfer holds significant potential for our business, both in the U.S. and globally. In addition to our strong partnership with MoneyGram, we are currently engaged with other leaders in the field to pursue additional opportunities.  As a leader in product innovation, prepaid is an area where we will continue to invest and foster global growth. In the U.S., our efforts to support issuers of major government prepaid programs continue.  With the Bank of America, we recently launched a significant prepaid disbursement card program for the state of California Employment Development Department. Additionally, the state of New York recently announced the launch of a Visa prepaid pilot program with Chase bank that will streamline how payments are made to parents receiving adoption subsidies.  Adoptive parents now have the option to receive those funds through a Visa-branded prepaid card issued by Chase instead of receiving their funds by check.  More and more, we see prepaid making a case for itself in every pocket of the globe and particularly, in emerging markets. This is true from Botswana and Georgia, two countries that recently partnered with Visa to introduce their first prepaid product solutions to India and Pakistan, which are further along the payments development curve.  In India, Visa developed the payment solution for the Unique Identification Authority of India to support that country's massive national program to issue unique identification numbers to local residents. This program has the benefits of deepening our relationship with the State Bank of India, potentially growing the number of transactions on Visa's network and advancing our goal of financial inclusion for underbanked individuals worldwide.  And in Pakistan, we are gratified to see the progress that has been made since we joined the government of Pakistan and United Bank Limited, Bank Alfalah and Habib Bank Limited to launch a national aid disbursement card program after last summer's floods. More than 1.4 million cards have been issued, delivering $317 million in humanitarian aid, one of the fastest rollouts of a disbursement program of this kind.  All of us who have been reading the news have seen a clear build up of excitement and attention around mobile payments, and we absolutely agree. The convergence of payments with mobile devices is a significant development in the evolution of digital currency and a top priority for Visa. Visa's presence in mobile payments is already well established worldwide with 25 payment programs in 19 countries worldwide.  We expect international markets will continue to be amongst the fastest adopters of this innovative payments technology. That said, we announced the commercial availability of mobile contactless payments in the United States and in other select markets. Last quarter, I said that we were standing on the threshold. And now for the first time in Visa's history, a mobile contactless payment solution is officially included in the list of Visa-compliant products available for use by our client financial institutions.  Wells Fargo has joined Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bank in piloting the technology with their customers. The solution works with existing contactless payment terminals installed at retail outlets worldwide, enabling Visa account holders to simply hold up their phone to pay for purchases.  We recognize that the U.S. market is complex and will require an inclusive approach that addresses the specific needs of all stakeholders. However, I believe Visa's network and payment expertise offers significant competitive advantage over new entrants, and I'm confident that we will play a key role in the evolution of mobile payments in the U.S. Visa's presence in the mobile channel also offers opportunity to build deeper relationships with existing customers as well as connect new participants with Visa through value-added products and services. An example is our recent launch of the Visa Mobile iPhone application, now available as a free download from the iTunes app store.  The application delivers customized discounts and is tailored to consumer's preferences and physical location, which enables merchants to reach consumers in a targeted way and gives consumers access to exclusive deals not available to other shoppers.  Security is another area in which we are evolving and differentiating Visa through innovation. Just last month, we announced significant improvements to VisaNet security capabilities, which will dramatically improve our ability to detect and prevent global electronic payments fraud.  By enhancing the underlying processing platform that powers Visa's advanced authorization offering, we are enabling our issuers to isolate fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones in real-time. And historical data tells us that this could help identify an incremental 29% of the global fraud annually. Not only is this applicable domestically but more importantly, in cross border applications, where you have higher incidences of fraud and so have greater levels of denied authorizations. Enhanced measures will allow for a greater number of transactions.  It's often easy to take our reliable, secured global processing capabilities for granted. But the reality is that as technology enables new payment platforms and competitors, our processing excellence will differentiate and advantage us competitively. So in that regard, I'm pleased to report that we had a flawless peak season of transactions processing, which means that we achieved 100% success in authorizing and settling all transactions between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. This marks the 18th year in a row that we have hit this mark.  That captures some of our most recent highlights and there will be more to come. Overall, we believe that we are operating from a position of strength, fully utilizing our assets and points of differentiation. Our competitive advantages are significant and will continue to enable us to deliver the payment in commerce solutions that consumers and merchants want.  Finally, I'd like to close with our thoughts about the recent legislative developments in the United States. With respect to the Federal Reserve's initial recommendations related to the debit provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, we believe the government is engaging in price mix into the benefit of virtually no one.  The debit price control legislation has been policy and requires thorough review and revision before potential implementation. To that end, we're working with the entire industry to help the 112th Congress and the Federal Reserve better understand how the provisions create significant unintended consequences that will harm consumers, the economy and financial institutions of all sizes, even if those institutions were supposedly exempt from the regulation.  Because of these threats, particularly the harm to the consumers, we believe Congress should re-examine the Durbin provisions and delay implementation to more carefully consider the complexities and unintended consequences of the provisions. Joint federal agencies should also provide an objective assessment of the impacts and present their findings to Congress for review and debate.  We are encouraged by the increasing number of voices speaking up about the unintended consequences of this legislation, most notably the authors of the financial reform, Representative Frank and former Senator Dodd.  We believe it is noteworthy that Representative Frank has indicated a willingness to work with those who are similarly concerned and amend the debit provisions to allow financial institutions to recover full costs associated with want running a reliable and secure debit network.  I've never seen the industry, including banks of all sizes, this engaged and coalesced around working together to improve the outcome. We and others in the industry are looking forward to participating in Representative Bachus' proposed hearing on this legislation, currently planned for mid-February. As we have seen, the more this issue is debated, the more questions are raised about who will really benefit in the end.  While we don't know yet the final rules, Visa is working aggressively to protect the interests of consumers and our clients, and we'll support the industry's activities to shape the legislation that impacts community banks, credit unions and larger banks alike.  But no matter the ultimate outcome, I want to say to you that we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth over the long term. We have developed a priority set of business strategies and are ready to deploy them when the law is finalized, allowing us to utilize our people and our assets to drive us successfully towards our goals. As you can appreciate, I think it's inappropriate to elaborate further on these strategies at this time for a host of reasons.  And now over to Byron.\nByron Pollitt: Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. Our business results reflect continued positive economic momentum, which remains global in scope. We saw solid worldwide growth driven by increases in cross-border travel and healthy gains in both credit and debit payment volumes. Now let me quantify these trends.  First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the September and December quarters, as well as payment and transaction results for the first four weeks of January. Following the review of our revenue drivers, I'll cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter, followed by guidance updates for fiscal year 2011.  Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 14% and improved slightly in the December quarter to 15%. We saw the following breakdowns in December quarter figures. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 12%, down slightly from 13% in the September quarter.  Rest of World payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 17%, up two percentage points from the 15% rate in the September quarter. More recently, through the 28th of January, U.S. payment volume growth moderated to a positive 10%. Although not yet available, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth to be significantly higher.  Global cross border volumes delivered a healthy 15% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter as the world continued to travel. And more recently, through the 28th of January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis sustained momentum with a 16% rate of growth.  Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 15% over the similar period a year ago and just slightly behind the 16% growth rate we saw in the September quarter. Through the 28th of January, processed transactions stayed the course, posting growth of 14%.  CyberSource billable transactions totaled $987 million for the quarter, a very strong 40% growth rate. We expect continued strength in this part of our business as eCommerce activity continues to grow both in the United States and internationally.  Now turning to the income statement. In our first fiscal quarter, gross revenues of $2.6 billion were up 13% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenues in the quarter were $2.2 billion, a 14% increase over the first quarter of 2010, driven by a sustained economic recovery, ongoing sectoral growth and better-than-anticipated cross border transaction.  Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was just over $1 billion, up 22% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the quarter ending September and the impact of pricing adjustments.  Data processing revenue was $844 million, up 10% over the prior year's quarter based on strong processed transaction growth rates for both Visa-processed and CyberSource transactions. As expected and discussed previously, data processing revenue growth was moderated by the impact of key contract renewals last quarter and by the prospective removal of certain offsetting gateway pass-through revenues and expenses.  International transaction revenues were up 14% to $630 million due to the sustained improvement in cross border volumes during the period. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenues came in at 15%, a little lower than our guidance but on track with expectations. We still expect client incentives to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% for the entire year.  Total operating expenses for the quarter were $872 million, up 17% from the prior year, driven by the incremental expense from the acquisition of CyberSource as well as the non-recurrence of our prior year onetime benefit of $41 million associated with the prepayment of the retailers litigation.  Additionally, remember that we announced an earnings-neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass-through activities. As a result, $67 million of revenue and expenses, which were booked in Q1 fiscal year 2010 will not re-occur in Q1 fiscal year 2011.  In the first quarter, this represented four percentage points of revenue growth. For the remainder of the year, these changes in presentation will continue to be earnings neutral and will impact revenue growth.  The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the first fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity and contributed a positive 1% increase compared to the same year period. While our operating margin for the quarter was 61%, please note that we expect to aggressively fund necessary long-term investments across our entire business.  One callout on depreciation and amortization. While the CyberSource acquisition added $22 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter, as an offset, beginning this fiscal year, we no longer recognize the $17 million in quarterly amortization for the asset step-up that was applied when we first merged in 2007. This step-up became fully amortized at the end of September 2010.  Capital expenditures were $75 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives.  Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investments of $6.5 billion. Of this total, $2.7 billion is restricted cash, which represents amounts sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the remaining five quarterly payments with $2.3 billion uncommitted as of the end of the first quarter.  As Joe mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we effectively repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of Class A shares at an average per share price of $72.08. This resulted in the lowering of our outstanding share count by 15.3 million shares, taking us to 713 million on an as-converted basis at the end of the fiscal first quarter.  Management remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. Accordingly, we will continue to be active buyers of our shares in the future at prices that align with our long-term view of the value of our shares. At the end of this fiscal quarter, $694 million of open-to-buys still remains from the $1 billion authorization approved in October.  Last week, we announced the early release of all remaining locked up Class C shares. This means 55 million shares will become eligible for sale on February 7, a month and a half ahead of the prescribed unlock date of March 25. All Class C shares sold in the public market after this date will automatically convert to Class A shares. As a reminder, the release does not increase our outstanding share count nor is there any dilutive effect.  In order to broaden our participation in the Brazilian prepaid market, we recently announced the sale of our 10% stake in Visa Vale issuer, CBSS to Banco do Brasil and Bradesco. CBSS will continue to issue Visa Vale prepaid cards in Brazil.  Visa's gross proceeds from the sale are $103 million. Upon regulatory approval, we will recognize an estimated pretax gain of approximately $85 million net of transaction costs, and we'll record the event in investment income. The amount of the gain, net of tax, is estimated to be approximately $44 million.  As for our guidance for 2011, given the results to date and little incremental clarity from the recent initial Fed rule-making, we have no changes from our prior outlook. As evidenced by our stock buyback, we remain optimistic about Visa's growth prospects over the long term. Once the final rules have been promulgated by the Fed, we will be in a better position to share with you our views on the financial impact to Visa in 2012.  And with that, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.\nTimothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about Money Transfer and how you sort of see your expansion plans, not only geographically, but if you'd also shed any light on sort of the economics that are shared between you and future Money Transfer partners. How do you think about that occurring as the business opportunity evolves?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, I think we've mentioned pretty succinctly the arrangement that we have with MoneyGram, and much of the revenue that we generate out of that comes through the transactional volume on our cards, both at the front and the back end of the transaction. Beyond that, Money Transfer is an integral part of our mobile strategy or our mobile technology strategy, both domestically and outside of the United States. I think that money transfer takes on different forms, depending on what part of the world it occurs in. The transactions or the cards that we provided in Pakistan are a good example of how something might be manifest. Some of the things that we are beginning to think about doing in India also would embrace that notion. As it relates to our financial arrangements between various different parties from a Money Transfer point of view, I think I'll decline to comment on that at this point in time, but we are excited about the notion of money transfer and how it will fit into our nook going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: As far as your goals for 2015, over 50% of your revenue international, looks to me like -- I mean, are you progressing faster than you thought? It looks -- I mean your revenue, your payments volume is down to 55%. Now U.S. actually down 200 basis points just quarter-over-quarter, and it looks to me like you might get your payment volume under 50% in U.S. maybe in one year to a year and a half. So are you progressing faster? And what is the difference in the revenue yield on the U.S. and international?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, there are differences in our yields around the world, depending on what business we're in in various different geographies. Having said that, I mean as it relates to your question, I think we have a goal out there. I think we're well on our way to meeting that goal. We might get it done a little bit faster. Remember, I've talked about country acceleration strategies, and we're doing much better in Brazil and Russia than we had thought we'd be doing. We think that the same thing will happen in Japan, and we're looking at several other countries right now. I can't bring that all together as succinctly as you might like and say, \"Hey, we're going to have more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the United States in two years or a quarter, three years.\" But we are well on our way to getting to that point, and let me re-emphasize what I said in the comments. And that is that 60% of our growth in the past quarter came from -- revenue growth came from transactions outside the United States.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with UBS.\nJason Kupferberg - UBS Investment Bank: Joe, just wanted to pick up on some of the comments you made around what's going on in Washington and just to get your sense if there is truly a genuine effort within Congress to pursue legislation that would actually change the language of the Durbin amendment. And absent that type of legislation, do you feel that the public comment period and lobbying by various folks on the Hill would be enough to try and make the final version of the rules much less onerous on the industry than the initial proposals? Because it seems like the Fed kind of came out December 16 and said, \"Hey, it doesn't really matter whether we like the Durbin amendment or whether it makes logical sense.\" They're simply charged with writing rules that implement the language and intent of the amendment, and they kind of said, \"Hey, our hands are tied.\" So I just wanted to get a sense from your vantage point, is the approach here to really push the legislative path to try and actually get the language of the amendment changed as opposed to just work kind of softer lobbying channels, which was kind of done back in November and December and at least, as it relates to the initial proposals, didn't seem to have a big impact on the Fed's initial decision making?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, I learned in November and December that it is foolish to try to predict exactly what Congress will or will not do. Having said that, I think I lean towards agreeing with you as it relates to the Fed and what they are able or not able to do. And while I don't think that dialoguing with the Fed or sending opinions or commenting about what's already out there, as we are supposed to do, is over and while I don't necessarily believe that some things can't be changed at the margin, I would say that the focus would be the Congressional focus at this particular time. And our position as well as I think every other financial institution in the United States is that the enactment of this legislation should be delayed and the unintended consequences should be studied, and it should require some action to reinstate or to bring into that anything associated with this amendment predicated on the findings of that study.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Frisch, Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Frisch - Morgan Stanley: The question we get a lot is around the fiscal '12 guide. And while you were able to give the fiscal '11 outlook, which theoretically includes one quarter of the Durbin impact, but not a view on fiscal '12. So Byron, my question for you is can you provide at least some color on the influences to the P&L in 2012 as a result of the regulatory activity?\nByron Pollitt: Our view has been from the beginning that when we guide to 2012, we would like the benefit of being able to interpret the rules that the Fed has promulgated and to put them into the context of the mitigation strategies and our go-forward strategies in the debit arena that we have crafted knowing that once the rules are clarified, we will know which ones are relevant. We'll be able to much better size the impact by line item and be able to give to all of you much more thoughtful guidance than we would today, which would be largely speculative. And so until the rules are clarified at which point we'll be able to -- we'll be much more open about what our competitive strategies would be at that time, we're going to defer at least another quarter before we address 2012.\nJoseph Saunders: Having said that, we've repeatedly suggested, by buying back our own stock and by publicly making comments, that we believe that Visa will survive and be a very viable growth company in the future, regardless of the outcome, the specific outcome of the legislation. But the specifics of that and the timing of what happens and how things may or may not happened really is, as Byron said, pretty dependent on what the final outcome of everything is currently happening becomes. I will remind you that the majority of our growth in the past quarter did not come from the debit card business. Much of it came from outside the United States and from other initiatives that we have within the United States. And I'll remind you that the debit business is about in the neighborhood of 20% of our total revenues. So I, again -- and of course, without being specific, we're not going to lose all that business under any circumstances. So you're going to have to think about it in your own terms, but we are excited about Visa's future, and we'll be specific about how excited we are when we have a framework in which to communicate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Kind of as a follow-up to what Adam just asked, I saw in the 10-Q that you know that it's going to be possible to mitigate the negative impacts from the Reform Act. And I'm curious, are these mitigation efforts going to come from primarily diversifying away from the U.S. and growing the international business like you just talked about, Joe? Or do you have a game plan in place in the U.S. to, I guess, reinvent the business model, particularly in debit? I'm not really looking for details. I'm just trying to rank the two in terms of priorities as we think about modeling the midterm -- the longer-term outlook for Visa?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, certainly, not all of our mitigation efforts will be focused on increasing our revenue outside the United States, although that is and has been, even prior to Durbin, one of our primary objectives, and it's an important part of who we will be in the future. But there are mitigation efforts that we will back against the business in the United States. And as we've just said, I mean, I'm not going to go into detail, but we're not going to turn our back on the United States. And we expect to grow revenue and develop our business whatever the outcome of the legislation is.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julio Quinteros, Goldman Sachs.\nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Byron, real quickly, just on the expense side, a little bit higher than what we were looking for here on the personnel side. Obviously, it looks like you guys have the inclusion of the CyberSource stuff and talked a little bit in 10-Q about having some additional headcount. And then on the other line item, I guess if you could also address the G&A side with a comment about the reserves for potential government assessment? How big is that? And is that a recurring item? Or it was just a onetime item?\nByron Pollitt: Yes. So on the personnel side, the major callout is we are lapping a quarter in which we did not have CyberSource. So we are -- that's the single largest component being added to the personnel line year-over-year. And then in addition to that, we are actively staffing our growth initiatives outside the United States. And so as we continue to put more boots on the ground to drive and accelerate revenue growth outside the U.S., you're going to see some of that in the personnel line, which will be somewhat amplified by the weakening U.S. dollar. So you are seeing some foreign exchange impact in that line as well. With regards to the G&A line, there are always going to be some factors that are non-recurring that are adjustments to certain reserves. That's the line item that it appears in, and this quarter, part of that explanation is non-recurring accruals related to those matters.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Bernstein Research: Turning away from the Durbin amendment stuff, can you give us an update on the latest status on the merchant litigation case in the Brooklyn court? And can you give us any thoughts on how to dimension the possibilities for a settlement and what forms the settlement might take?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, unfortunately, the answer is no. I can't answer any of those questions. Obviously, the litigation continues, and there are conversations. But beyond that, I really would be foolish to say anything else.\nByron Pollitt: If I could just add one comment, actually, to Julio's prior question. Julio, the G&A also is impacted by the addition of CyberSource. So literally, all the line items in the P&L are being impacted by the pickup of CyberSource expenses. So that's another important driver of that line.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bruce Harting, Barclays Capital.\nBruce Harting - Barclays Capital: I guess we agree with your position on the Durbin legislation and on unintended consequences, but in the event that the Fed rule stands as is and they extend the exclusivity issue to signature debit, what are the technology difficulties? Or what would you be lobbying to the Fed right now in argument of not extending to signature? And indeed, I mean, it looks like there's only two networks able to provide that, correct? So wouldn't that just solidify the strength of the oligopoly that they're worried about policing? And who pays the cost to change the cards? Would that be incurred by the banks? And how long would it take to implement that change? Would it take -- would that be something that could be turned around by the banks in terms of reissuing new cards with two networks within a month? Or is that a six-to-12-month issue? And is it true that the merchant acquirer decides on the routing anyway? And wouldn't they be incentivized to go with -- to stick with you, since many of the merchant acquirers are your customers currently and would want to get the discount?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, I mean you've asked a lot of extraordinarily good questions and therein lies the dilemma. I mean, everything you said is reasonably accurate. We are in a very good position, and regardless of what happens, I don't think you're going to see any kind of an overnight deterioration. And I think you're obviously going to see us doing everything that we can to be the network of choice, and I think that there are many compelling reasons that we can put forth that will help us secure that position. And whatever happens, we look forward to using our people and our assets, which we believe in this regard are second to none, to make sure that we come out ahead of the game.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Kissane, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJames Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch: Byron, can you give us a sense of what portion of your U.S. revenue is from issuers and what portion is from acquirers? Again, just on the U.S. side.\nByron Pollitt: Jim, for some time, it has been plus or minus, roughly equal, plus or minus. It has not materially changed when we first talked about that. I think it was about a year ago. It might be a bit more. If I were to round it, we would round it a bit more to the acquirer, but there's been no material change since we first voiced that ratio about a year ago.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Maurer, CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: I wanted to follow up on your discussion of Mobile. Considering we are likely to see the likes of Google and Apple come out in a big way supporting contactless payments this year, how do you expect or how do you envision re-terminalization to occur? Do you expect there to be subsidies to get merchants involved, who will likely be offering those subsidies? And will we see the tone of Visa's marketing in the U.S. change to support some of the issuers that are trying to roll this out?\nJoseph Saunders: Well, Visa is in support of chip technology and on a global basis. Timing of when it will occur and how it will occur is still somewhat questionable, particularly in the United States. I think that the current state of affairs between the Card Act and the Durbin amendment has stopped some issuers as it relates to whether they want to invest and how do they want to invest. I don't think that there's any magic wand that is going to automatically make a contactless chip terminals or contact chip terminals automatically appear in an overwhelming way in the United States. I think that that will indeed take some time, and I think most issuers and even merchants believe that to be the case. I'm not certain, but I actually think there are somewhat fewer contactless terminals today than there may have been a year ago. So we've got -- there are issues in that regard as it relates to standards, chip standards. There isn't one contactless chip standard around the world and so all of this has to be reconciled before it becomes -- we become a country, where people walk around with cell phones and just automatically walk into face-to-face merchants, swipe their cell phones on a contactless. That being said, there is an inextricable momentum to mobile technology and contactless chips that is beginning to occur, and it will manifest itself over some period of time. We are extraordinarily involved in those efforts, and things that we are doing in that regard will become apparent as each quarter goes on. And we're reasonably confident that we have invested the right time and effort and capital into taking our business in the appropriate direction.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Just model related, Byron, on that personnel color that you provided, so that delta year-over-year, is that something we should extrapolate for the remainder of the year across the quarters? And then you mentioned rebates kind of coming in within the same range you guys had articulated. That would suggest that the next three quarters' run rates are probably going to be higher than what we saw in the first quarter, obviously. Is there any kind of seasonality that we should expect within that trend?\nByron Pollitt: Yes. So on the first one, with regards to personnel, as you readjust your models for that line item, it would make sense to look at the fourth quarter of last fiscal year recognizing that we integrated CyberSource and I think the last two months of the quarter. So you should see a beginning step-up in personnel expense the next quarter -- so the quarter just completed, that's reflective of what you should be thinking about going forward, recognizing that there's always going to be some degree of lumpiness in personnel as we make various accruals, but we would suggest keying more off the first quarter. As it relates to our word, our expression is client incentives. I think another company uses rebates. With regards to client incentives, this is -- as we've talked about historically, this is a category that tends to be a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter based on when certain contracts are signed, when renewals are signed. And so rather than seasonality, let's use it's a bit lumpy, and therefore, we came in a bit lower than our full year guidance in the first quarter. Therefore, you should see some -- in future quarters, we would expect it to come in a bit higher to average out to somewhere between 16% and 16.5% on a full year basis.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Mammone with Deutsche Bank.\nChristopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank AG: Just a question on Rest of World credit volume. Nice pickup in the most recent data, so just wondering if you had anything to call out there, just what you see what's sort of driving that net solid growth rate.\nByron Pollitt: So on Rest of World credit volume, looking at it on a constant dollar basis, it has been pretty steady -- again, on a constant dollar basis, pretty steady double digits, mid-teen double digits through 2010, and January picked up a little bit, but that's -- no, the first quarter picked up a little bit. So it looks like very sustained positive momentum. Our transaction volume is picking up. Our processed transactions are picking up outside the United States, so that's encouraging. And the cross border travel outside the United States has remained very, very healthy. So with January, a pickup over the first quarter levels by a couple of points. So from that standpoint, the economic momentum for Rest of World appears very solid, very sustained, both from a domestic standpoint and from a cross border standpoint.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bryan Keane, Credit Suisse.\nBryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: I guess just two questions. I guess first, do you have any indication from Washington that getting the Durbin amendment delayed is a realistic outcome? Meaning, is there some real legs behind this right now? And then secondly, just on mobile payment, how will the economics change with the new competitors getting involved like Apple, Nokia, Isis and others? Or do you think the economics of Visa, like they have in the physical world, will be the same in the mobile world?\nJoseph Saunders: I can't predict what Congress is going to do. I can remind you that there is significant effort that is going on that is embraced by large banks, mid-sized banks, small banks, credit unions. I think that you will see some reaction from consumers, because in our opinion, consumers have been thrown under the bus in this legislation. And so in that regard, I would have to think that through some of the conversations we've had and because it is the right thing -- and I want to emphasize, it is the right thing. We're on the right side of this issue. I'd like to think that something will happen. I would like to think, as I said earlier, that it will take the form of a delay in the implementation of the legislation until the unintended consequences can be better assessed. But I can't promise you that. I can't tell you that I've had secret conversations with anybody and that this is a [indiscernible] (1:03:14), because none of those things would be true. So now that I've answered that, I forgot the second part of -- Mobile. That's an interesting question. But when you look at mobile technologies, as I said just a few minutes ago, I mean, it's coming or it's here. However, you want to define it. It makes it easier for people to shop. It opens up new avenues of things that may be purchased through your wallet, and there are a lot of technology companies that have significantly positive offerings and capabilities in this regard. Visa also has significant capability. We still have VisaNet. We still have a whole processing infrastructure. There are still 1.8 billion cardholders around the world, and we have been vigorously looking at and working on the technology. And we think we're going to be in a very good position as it relates to the evolution of mobile technology in the electronic payments business. I think that it will afford us some revenue opportunities that we currently don't have, and I think that will be a very positive thing. Will it change some of the other economics we have? I mean, it could. It could, but when we look at the overall landscape, we are comfortable that this is a positive thing for Visa and will be a positive thing going forward. And remember, we've talked to these other entities that you're referring to, and they do need some of the capabilities that we'd have, or they're either going to have to provide them themselves, or they're going to have to come to somebody like us to get them. And so there are compelling reasons for partnerships to occur. A significant -- even when you look at somebody like PayPal, let's not forget that a significant amount of their business is driven through Visa, MasterCard, and that isn't about to change in the near future. And I know that's not totally analogous to mobile technology, but I think that what Visa has put together over the years is very compelling as it relates to what it brings to the party from a speed or reliability or privacy and a security point of view. I don't think we're going to let that go.\nJack Carsky: Jose, we have time for a final question.\nOperator: The final question does come from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.\nGlenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Just for Byron, the services yield went up pretty significantly, Q-to-Q. I think you alluded to a pricing change in the quarter. Does that account for the whole differential on the yield? And is it a sort of a sustainable yield level going forward?\nByron Pollitt: That is the primary driver, and that would be sustainable going forward.\nJack Carsky: All right. Thank you all very much for joining us today. If anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to call Investor Relations. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time."}], "2013": [{"symbol": "V", "quarter": 4, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-10-31 21:20:04", "content": "Executives: Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations Joseph W.

And as always, thank you all for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that our hearts and thoughts are with the people on the East Coast of the United States who are now recovering from Hurricane Sandy. Many of our clients, our employees, our partners and investors like you live in affected areas. And we hope that you, your families and your neighbors are all safe and moving toward a full and speedy recovery. Visa closed out fiscal 2012 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering net operating revenues of $2.7 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.54, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. The adjustment in diluted earnings reflects the impact of a $627 million increase in net income during the fourth quarter from the reversal of tax reserves and accrued interest associated with our covered litigation. This was due to the withdrawal of the notice of proposed adjustment by the IRS during the quarter. Byron will provide additional commentary. Revenue gains for the quarter were driven by particularly strong payments volume growth for credit products in the United States, as well as continued expansion of our core business and growth of processed transactions in international markets. Visa also delivered strong performance for the full fiscal year. Net operating revenue in 2012 was a record $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over 2011. Adjusted net income was $4.2 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $6.20, 24% ahead of last year. Now let's turn the discussion to what's ahead in 2013. Byron will get into specifics on broad guidance for fiscal 2013, but we are reaffirming our commitment to a growth rate in the high teens for adjusted diluted earnings per share. That being said, Visa is taking a measured approach to the coming year. We are mindful of uncertainties in the global operating environment, including softness in some pockets of the global economy and continued volatility in Europe. And given our better-than-anticipated performance in fiscal 2012, we essentially raised the bar in ourselves and now face somewhat tougher comparisons in the coming year. With that in mind, at this early point in fiscal 2013, we are once again setting our net revenue guidance growth to low-double digits. An improving economic environment could well change our view, but we'll take a prudent road for the time being. Effective tomorrow, Charlie Scharf becomes Visa's Chief Executive Officer. I will continue as Executive Chairman of the company until March 31, at which point I plan to retire. Charlie's appointment was the result of a thorough and robust succession process. Charlie is a proven leader. He has experience as a senior executive with large global enterprise and is familiar with Visa both as a client and as a board member. Importantly, Charlie drove innovation well at the helm of Chase's retail operation. I am confident that Charlie will hit the ground running, not miss a beat and accelerate our forward momentum. I look forward to working with him to make this transition seamless. And I'm sure he looks forward to getting to know you better, and that he will talk to you directly when he leads our next earnings call. Given Visa's outlook for growth, we continue to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. During the quarter, our as-converted common share count was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share by spending $324 million. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors authorized an incremental $1.5 billion for Class A share repurchases. Additionally, as reported last week, our board raised our dividend 50% over last year's rate to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis. Turning to our business in the United States. Overall, we continue to apply a disciplined approach to expand Visa's business in the rapidly evolving technological and competitive landscape. Our business is tracking closely with our expectations. For credit products, Visa extended our gains. During the September quarter, payment volume grew 9% with particular strength from our products. Prepaid growth also continues to be strong in the United States with the general purpose of payroll segments serving as our 2 biggest growth drivers in the category during the September quarter, posting 28% and 30% payment volume growth respectively. Now let's turn to U.S. debit, where the situation continues to play out as expected and in line with our guidance. Quarter by quarter, we are getting smarter about how to operate in the new environment in which we wish to pull to grow our debit business. That being said, I want to reiterate our belief that the share loss resulting from the Dodd-Frank regulation is both permanent and fully incorporated in our FY '13 guidance. Overall U.S. debit growth rates have stabilized since our last earnings report, with aggregate debit payment volume growth modestly improving to negative 6% during the September quarter. Further, we have been working with issuers to secure long-term contracts. To that end, we've secured our top 15 U.S. debit issuers to long-term agreements. In short, our revised strategies for the U.S. debit segment continue to gain traction in the marketplace, achieving Visa's own operational and financial expectations while simultaneously delivering value and benefit to our clients. As for the U.S. Department of Justice's civil investigative demand, I have no material update. We are regularly submitting data to the DOJ. The company will continue to update you as the situation develops, but we remain comfortable in our position on this issue. At the same time, we are making steady progress towards completing the previously announced merchant litigation settlement in the United States. On October 19, the merchant plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval. Subsequently, the judge set an accelerated timetable last week, which calls for hearings on the motion on November 9. We are hopeful the judge will grant preliminary approval shortly thereafter, with the rules becoming effective 60 days later. Bottom line, I'm confident that the overwhelming majority of merchants will support the agreement and it will be approved. Now let's briefly turn to Visa's international geographies where payment volume growth moderated slightly during the fiscal fourth quarter but still delivered strong revenue growth of 13% as we continue to maintain our strong competitive leadership position. Overall, we continue to advance towards our goal of generating 50% of our revenue from outside the United States. To drive growth, we continue to apply a targeted investment strategy, which deploys locally tailored acceleration plans within several key geographies. In doing so, our goal is to substantially increase Visa's revenue over a 5-year time horizon. In the interest of time, I won't walk through a list of new and expanded agreements from the quarter. But suffice it to say, we continue to grow our relationships with financial institutions, merchants and governments of all sizes around the world. And these are driving payment volume and processed transactions, as well as revenue growth for Visa. This approach will continue to be a priority as our organization moves ahead in the future. Lastly, let me talk about Visa's innovation agenda, an area where we are making considerable progress. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business platforms, add incremental value to the merchant community and their acquirers and forge new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our financial institution clients. But most importantly, we know that our innovations must create real value for our clients and account holders who ultimately use these products and services. Let's start with V.me, our digital wallet. We are making significant progress putting together the network that will enable us to scale consumer adoption of V.me. On the issuer front, we recently announced 2 major partners, PNC and U.S. Bank, both of which will make an immediate impact as we begin to grow users of the product. All together, we have 34 agreements signed with leading U.S. issuers, including 4 of our 10 largest institutions in the United States. Looking ahead, we're confident that the number will continue to grow. Together, they give us the opportunity to tap roughly 50 million consumers through our bank partners. We look forward to making additional announcements in this area in the coming months. At the same time, we're making progress to signing up merchants for V.me. By the middle of 2013, we expect to have more than 1,000 online merchants using V.me, including 20 of the 50 largest e-commerce merchants in the country. I want to reiterate that V.me is designed to help capture the significant immediate growth opportunity in e-commerce. e-commerce is one of our fastest-growing channels, with Forrester Research predicting that U.S. consumers will spend $327 billion online by 2016, up 45% from the $226 billion in 2012. As a reminder, V.me creates a simplified and secure e-commerce experience for consumers no matter what payment device or technology they choose to transact with. This offers our clients a differentiated solution to address a real market opportunity today and provides a fast and convenient experience with consumers making online purchases. At the same time, Visa is a leader in enabling NFC payments at the point of sale in the United States. As one example, Isis, the payments joint venture founded by AT&T Mobility, T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless, is currently enabling Visa payments via NFC in its own mobile wallet as part of their recently launched pilot. Isis's open approach aligns with Visa's strategy of enabling consumers to make mobile payments with whatever device they choose using the trusted accounts they already have. Consumer adoption of NFC is in its very early stages today. And I'm very comfortable that Visa is well positioned to deliver the best mobile solutions to our clients, helping them take advantage of this long-term shift in consumer behavior. Also on the innovation front, I'm pleased that CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions total $1.4 billion, growing 25% versus the same period a year ago. CyberSource's unique capabilities are particularly resonating in international markets. At the time we bought CyberSource, they had field operations in only 4 countries. Today, that number is 12 and growing, and CyberSource teams are benefiting from Visa's local market knowledge. To conclude, I'd like to say again how proud I am of what we've accomplished toward Visa. Since our restructuring 5 years ago, we have successfully delivered on all of our investor commitments and transitioned to a solid public company that will continue to compete globally well into the future. Visa is built on a simple yet effective strategy: To be the best way to pay and be paid. To deliver on that promise, we have created an organization that is focused on delivering payment products and services to the evolving needs of consumers, merchants, governments and financial institutions. We have also established a culture that can adapt to a fast-changing landscape and thrive in the midst of challenges. And we are well positioned to continue to expand our core business, invest in next-generation technologies that will define the future of payments and accelerate expansion of our business outside of the United States. Today, I know we have the right people, the right strategy, the right technology and the right experience to continue to be a leader of our industry. And with Charlie as CEO, I am confident that Visa will continue to grow globally and deliver innovation that meets the needs of Visa account holders and our clients. I'd like to thank everyone at Visa, all of our partners and all of our investors for the opportunity to work with you. I look forward to seeing Visa take full advantage of all that lies ahead. And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron.\nByron H. Pollitt: Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We were recently notified by the IRS that the NOPA, or Notice of Proposed Adjustment, in connection with the deductibility of our litigation payments made in 2008, had been withdrawn. As a result, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with all covered litigation expense previously recorded. This increased net income for the quarter by $627 million. Second, U.S. revenue growth continues to be supported by solid credit payment volume growth, although our 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth were interrupted as the September quarter clocked in at 9%. Through the 28th of October, however, credit payment volume growth has comped at an 11% rate, a notable rebound, reflecting a month-to-month volatility dynamic we've seen more of recently. Third, with 4 quarters of lower U.S. debit interchange and 2 quarters of the new debit routing rule behind us, the impacts have been manageable. Aggregate U.S. debit posted a negative 6% growth rate in the fourth quarter versus a negative 9% in the third quarter led by Interlink payment volume, which was off 48% versus 54% in the third quarter. While we are pleased our mitigation strategies are working as planned and are consistent with our expectations, we would caution that the U.S. debit environment is still evolving. Finally, as was the case last quarter, the all-in impact from U.S. debit regulation, which includes restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, cost us about $0.04 in EPS for the quarter. Management's view of the future effects have been incorporated into our guidance. Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the quarter followed by our results through October 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2013. Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 6%, unchanged from the June quarter. The U.S. grew at 1% and Rest of World at 12%. More recently, through October 28, U.S. payment volume growth posted a 3% gain comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 4% for debit. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 10% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter, which compares to a 14% rate in the third quarter. The U.S. grew 8% and the Rest of World, 11%. The moderation in growth was broad-based, with notable stepdowns in the U.S., North and Southeast Asia and Latin America. Through October 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 11%, with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and Rest of World at 12%. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 14 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 2% increase over the prior year period and up from 1% in the prior quarter. A debit-led decline of 1% in the U.S. was offset by a 19% growth in the Rest of World. For the month of October through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a positive 4%, driven by an improving trajectory in the U.S. Separately, CyberSource recorded 1.4 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year. Three callouts. First, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is being felt by our Interlink product, where transaction growth will continue to be negative until we lap the implementation of the routing rules in the middle of next year. Second, Visa processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and Rest of World. Finally, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we are operating under the assumption that the U.S. and global economies will continue their moderate growth over the next 12 months as uncertainty from the fiscal cliff, continued Eurozone concerns and a general slowdown in world trade put a damper on domestic consumer cross-border spending. Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year and ahead of our expectations as a result of stronger U.S. debit and credit performance. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year and a better performance than we had anticipated going into the year. After hedges, there was negative 1% foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter and no impact to the full year. Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This reflects strong payment volume growth in the June quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $1.1 billion, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates from Visa processed transactions outside of the U.S. and for CyberSource globally, as well as competitive pricing actions that became effective last quarter. The step-up in gross revenue data processing yield, which we first saw last quarter, continued to carry through this quarter due in part to strategic pricing adjustments but also driven by the ongoing, though moderating, decline in Interlink transactions, which are, by far, our lowest-yielding product. International transaction revenue was up 5% to $796 million, reflecting solid but moderating strength in cross-border volumes, with mid-single-digit-growth rates in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, low-double-digit growth in Latin America and low 20s in our SEMEA region as measured on a constant dollar basis. Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenues came in at 17%, lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to better-than-expected revenue performance but in line in terms of absolute dollars. For the fiscal year 2012, incentives were 17% of gross revenues, at the low end of our guidance of 17% to 18%. While total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 18%, it is important to note that this heavier-than-normal operating expense level is not a new quarterly run rate. When viewed on a full year adjusted basis, expenses grew 12%, of which approximately 2 percentage points were due to annualizing acquisition expenses. And as expected, this annual expense growth was consistent with delivering a 60% adjusted operating margin, which was our guidance for the year. As further perspective on expenses, 3 callouts. First, we staged more of our investment spend in the second half of the year to enable a tighter linkage between revenue and expense growth. Second, marketing spend of $271 million intensified in Q4, associated with the London Olympics. For the full year, marketing expenses were $873 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year and in line with our guidance. And finally, third, we took over $30 million in Q4 restructuring reserves, which included the closing of our San Francisco offices and consolidation of our staff into our Foster City campus. Looking ahead to 2013, we have planned a closer balance between first and second half operating spend. Our operating margin for the quarter was 56%, bringing our fiscal full year adjusted margin to 60%, which, as noted earlier, was on target with our guidance for the year. Capital expenditures were $141 million in the quarter and ended the fiscal year at $376 million. This roughly represents the midpoint of our guidance range. Our adjusted tax rate for Q4 was 33%, and for the entire fiscal year, 33%. As I mentioned at the outset, both of these figures were affected by events over the course of the year. During the quarter, total as-converted Class A common stock was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share, utilizing $324 million of operating cash on hand. This is inclusive of the $150 million escrow funding made in late July. As Joe mentioned at the outset, our board recently authorized a new repurchase program totaling $1.5 billion effective through October of 2013. This is incremental to the $865 million still outstanding from our previous authorization. We also raised our annual dividend 50% to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a payout ratio of about 21% on 2012 adjusted earnings. At the end of the September quarter, we had 668 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fourth quarter totaled 672 million, and for the full fiscal year, 678 million. Finally, let me finish up with our guidance for fiscal 2013. In terms of the top line, as Joe said at the outset, we are guiding to net revenue growth in the low double digits, though the possibility of upside exists if we were to see a noticeably stronger economic rebound over the course of the year than we are currently experiencing. As a reminder, going in the fiscal 2012, we built into our internal projections a sustained but modest recovery for that year, with fiscal Q3 and Q4 bearing the brunt of U.S. debit regulation followed by economic acceleration in 2013. That said, the trends in the past 2 quarters suggest economic assumptions around 2013 were too optimistic. Many of the same uncertainties remain. And while we lost significant U.S. debit share, we weathered the second half of 2012 better than we expected. As we look ahead into 2013, growing uncertainty in the U.S. and world economy has precipitated a slowdown in domestic and cross-border spending. When we combine this global outlook with the higher bar created by better-than-anticipated 2012 revenue growth, we now find ourselves in a situation similar to 2012 and believe revenue guidance in the low-double-digit range is the right call at this time. Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth remains the same, at a high teens rate. Client incentives, as a percent of gross revenue, are expected to range between 18% and 18.5%. We expect this modest increase over fiscal 2012 to be driven by a growing level of incentives for financial institutions outside the U.S. in combination with incentive contracts with large U.S. merchants and acquirers. Marketing expense is projected to be under $1 billion. However, we will see modest moderate uptick over the level of fiscal 2012 with more of the marketing spend budgeted in the first half versus the prior year. The uptick will be driven by greater investment in our APCEMEA region, as well as incremental investments behind our V.me and mobile initiatives. Operating margin is expected to remain at about 60%. The tax rate is expected to be in the 30% to 32% range. This reduction anticipates benefits from foreign tax credits to be claimed in fiscal 2013. We anticipate the timing of these benefits to be skewed more to the second half of the fiscal year. Capital expenditures are projected to range from $425 million to $475 million. This represents a moderate increase over the $376 million we spent in 2012 and fully funds investments we are making across the globe in support of our core business as well as our mobile and e-commerce initiatives. Finally, we expect free cash flow of about $5 billion. Our priorities for use of this cash remain the same: first, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisition; and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Before we take your questions, recognizing Joe's retirement next March, I want to briefly reflect on Visa's 5 years as a merge to business entity and our 4.5-year public life. With 2008 as a base year and despite a deep U.S. recession and challenging regulatory environment, under Joe's leadership, the Visa team has delivered net revenue growth at a 14% compound annual growth rate and adjusted diluted EPS at a 29% compound annual growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin has gone from 46% in March of 2008 to 60% today. We lowered our tax rate from 41% to 33%. We have tripled our dividend rate through annual increases and have collectively returned $1.8 billion in dividends to our shareholders IPO to date. Lastly, over that same period of time, we have reduced our common share count through litigation escrow funding and open market purchases by 118 million shares, representing $9 billion returned to shareholders. And with that, operator, for the 19th time since going public, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I had a question on your new CEO starting tomorrow, Charlie. I guess why -- what led you to Charlie Scharf? I mean, this is a dynamic time technology business, international growth. Charlie's, everything we can tell, is a very strong executive but more of a U.S. Bank guy. What were the key choices in selecting Charlie and going outside the company today versus internal?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, as I mentioned in my comments today, he's a dynamic executive, he has done well. He understands our business. He's been a client. He has been on our board. And if you remember, he was on the board of this company for 3 years. He has more than a fleeting familiarity with Visa. He is very familiar with the staff at Visa, having interacted with many of them for a number of years. He has run large global operations in the past. And while he's not a technologist, per se, he's run large organizations that depend very significantly on technology. We also, as you remember, have parsed our company in a way where we have focused on technology simultaneous to what we do in our core business. And there has to be a recognition that our core business is the -- is what's feeding this engine and what's creating the revenue and the cash flow that allows us to invest. We have an extremely strong technology organization. We've hired a number of extraordinary individuals over the last 2 or 3 years. We're very, very confident that, that organization has the ability to take -- to continue to take us forward. And, in fact, I think you'd have to admit that vis-\u00e0-vis other companies in our space, we're way out front, and we don't intend to lose that. So thanks for asking the question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Just one of the beauties of Visa's business model is kind of the scalability. And just in looking at your operating margin guidance, it seems like we have another year in 2013 of relatively modest operating margin expansion. Could you just talk about the dynamics that kind of preclude that from happening? And then specific -- one just callout or clarification. I was wondering if there was a callout on the other revenue line, because that was up a little bit?\nByron H. Pollitt: The -- with regards to operating margin leverage, we have been kicking up the pace of reinvesting, particularly in our growth initiatives that are -- that really won't begin to drive revenue in a meaningful way until 3 and 4 and 5 years out. And you can look at mobile, V.me. And so what we have done up to this point is invest aggressively in new office expansions and deploying more account executives serving clients in country, all of which drive margin expansion, which, as you've noticed, has moved from 46%, which seems like a lifetime ago, up to 60%. And as more of our investment or acquisitions are much more forward-looking, there will be more of a lag between when that'll show up in operating leverage expansion versus pure investment in the core that leverages the -- completely the VisaNet platform. With regards to other revenue, the reserves associated with the release of the FIN 48 expenses that we had recorded associated with the NOPA, a part of that was -- part of those reserves were recorded in other income. And as we released those reserves, they showed up in that column.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Greg Smith of Sterne Agee.\nGregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Byron, just 2 quick questions on the 2013 guidance. Is there any pricing -- are there any pricing increase assumptions in there? And the second one is just, can you reiterate what you said on marketing? Will we actually see the first half heavier than the second half or just more of a skew compared to 2012, please?\nByron H. Pollitt: Can you repeat the last question again?\nGregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just the total marketing spend, you called out that the -- you said there would be more of a skew to the first half. Were you talking just total absolute dollars heavier in the first half than the second half? I just wasn't clear on that.\nByron H. Pollitt: Yes. So -- yes, let me deal with that one first. There was a -- if you look at the total amount of marketing spend that we incurred in the fourth quarter, it was $271 million. That was 31% of our entire year's marketing budget. And what we have in marketing is a -- this year, is a percentage and dollar weighted much higher to the fourth quarter or to the second half. And on a percentage basis for next year, we expect to see a better balance, a more even -- it won't be 50-50, but there -- it'll be much more in balance between what is spent in the first half and second half. And even though you asked that question in the context of marketing, let me broaden that and say that, that should hold true for our entire operating expenses. We were much more second half weighted this past year than we expect to be in the year to come. And I'm sorry, your first question was?\nGregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: In price increases.\nByron H. Pollitt: Price increases. I would say that there is very little in the way of pricing built into the coming year. And in fact, we are giving back some effective pricing as a part of our response in the U.S. debit arena. So the revenue growth for next year is going to be delivered the good old-fashioned way, by driving hard against payment volume, not only in the U.S. but in the Rest of World in particular.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.\nJason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to get a general update on the e-commerce business in terms of either your percent of volume or percent of revenue or growth or whatever metrics you can provide? And some color on to what extent V.me can accelerate this and perhaps in which time frame? And then just a quick clarification for Byron. What caused the jump up in other income here in Q4?\nJoseph W. Saunders: You go first.\nByron H. Pollitt: Okay. So with regards to other income, this was -- it was principally driven by 2 things. The release of reserves, which are related to the reversal of the NOPA reserves on the IRS situation that clarified itself this past quarter. A part of the -- the vast majority of those reserves are taxes. But when you are put into a situation where you potentially have to pay back taxes, then you have an interest charge. And that's -- that interest charge was the source of the release in reserves that hit that column. In addition, we had some insurance recoveries that occurred that quarter, and that's why those popped up. On the e-commerce, with regards to the percentage of our business, we don't have an update on that for the moment. But this is our fastest-growing channel across the company globally. And within that e-commerce channel, the fastest-growing form factor is mobile. And this is why we have put such emphasis on V.me, which is particularly suited for the mobile form factor, and why we have put such strong focus on mobile strategies that go far beyond NFC and are global in scope.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I got 2 quick ones maybe. Just on the rebate line, that was nicely lower than we expected for the quarter. I'm curious for next year, the line of sight into the 18%, 18.5%, how much of that step-up is sort of signed based on your deals that you've already renewed or recently won versus anticipated deals? Just trying to get a better sense of conservatism versus reality there. And then secondarily on debit, I know there's a little bit of improvement in October. How much of that is paved in -- from the other mitigation strategies versus just macro or new wins? That would be great.\nByron H. Pollitt: Okay. So on the incentive side, I would say, first of all, that the drivers are almost as much Rest of World contracts that a number of which -- a meaningful increment of which have already been signed and will begin annualizing at a higher incentive rate going into next year. And we've already -- and so that's one major driver of the incentive increase. The other major driver is that we're only 2 quarters into the routing rule changes in U.S. debit. And as a result of that, we've got a building momentum of agreements that we are signing with merchants and acquirers. And that also will -- has yet to annualize in the coming year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Thomas McCrohan of Janney.\nThomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Can you expand a little bit about the routing agreements that are still being signed with the merchant community? Just give us a sense of how those are going to be structured and how they're going to be flowing through the income statement?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, what I would say is 2 things. These agreements are very much performance-oriented agreements. They -- for the most part, they only pay out incentives if the volume is delivered. Now I think it's important to emphasize that the agreements, themselves, don't guarantee volume. They incent it. If the volume is there, the incentives will be paid. And if they aren't, they aren't. And so there is -- to a certain extent, there is a degree of variability with regards to how much incentives will be paid out and it will be completely tied to the volume delivered. And then we are still, as I said before, on a path of signing additional merchants with these agreements, so we do expect them to be not only performance-based but to grow in number as the year unfolds. The way these are booked into the income statement is virtually 100% contra-revenue incentives.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.\nJulio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just a quick question on kind of decomposing the EPS growth rate. I'm understanding where the revenue growth is and the target for the margins. If you think about the buyback that you guys have currently coupled with your lower tax rate, is there some proportions that we should be thinking about in terms of how much of the buyback is built into the EPS growth? And then also the tax rate, I think you say was in the 30% to 32% range, is that correct?\nByron H. Pollitt: Yes. So, Julio, I'm going to let you do the math. What we've done is given you the -- given you all the metrics that we typically give you at this point of time. The -- clearly, there is a dynamic with the double -- low-double-digit revenue growth and the operating margin is -- will be the major contributor. Tax, once again, will allow us to add a little octane to the EPS growth. And then as you have noticed, we're very disciplined repurchases -- repurchasers of our stock over the course of the year. We also have a habit of readdressing the opportunity for buyback at every single board meeting. So today, as we enter into the fiscal -- new fiscal year, we have $865 million of previously authorized but unspent open to buy on share repurchase. We have $1.5 billion new program that was just announced. So that gives us a little over $2.3 billion of open to buy. And then, of course, later in the year, should circumstances warrant, we have the opportunity to go back to the board and ask for additional share repurchase opportunity. Recognize, however, that the later in the year that the share repurchases occur, the corresponding lower impact they will have on a given year's EPS.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bill Carcache of Nomura.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Joe, some of the U.S. data that we've seen shows a clear consumer preference for PIN over Signature. I wonder if you could comment on whether that's, in fact, what you're seeing as well; and if so, what you attribute that to? And then if you could just kind of share your thoughts on how strategic you see the role of U.S. debit in the context of your suite of payment products, now that it isn't the growth driver that it once was?\nByron H. Pollitt: So we're -- I suppose we're in a bit of a odd position to comment on this in one sense because with regards to PIN, thanks to a regulatory change, a substantial part of our PIN market share was gifted to our competition. And so it's a little hard for us on the margin to comment on the PIN. However, on the Signature debit, or what we refer to as Visa Debit, I can tell you that our business has, since the implementation of the rules, I think in prior quarters, we have experienced solid mid-single digit growth. And that growth rate is on balance, drifting a little north in the most recent quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, great. Yes, in terms of the way growth trends are generally playing out in the month of October, MasterCard today indicated growth improvement outside of the U.S., and generally, stability in the U.S. Are you taking somewhat of a more cautious stance on the recent growth trends, or is your view fairly consistent with the way MasterCard characterized it earlier today?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, they have an eloquent way of stating things, as you've mentioned before. But I wouldn't say we're copying MasterCard. I'd say our growth in the United States, particularly in the credit business, which is our highest-yielding business, is significantly stronger than any of our competition, and it continues to grow. And I mentioned that in my remarks earlier. We have strong growth outside of the United States as well. MasterCard deals in Europe, and we don't. They have quite a bit of strength in Europe, but our Asian and Latin American businesses are growing at very robust rates. We continue to believe that we'll have more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the United States in a very short period of time. I think that there is tough competition to deal with. I mean, I don't think there's any question about that, but we're doing very well. And in the parts of the world in which we do business, we are competitively advantaged, and we intend to maintain that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just looking at the Rest of World, it was a little bit lower than we expected. I think you mentioned maybe Asia was -- and obviously looking at the numbers, it looked like Asia was a little bit slower. But can you talk about the Rest of World? Was that all economy that's causing the deceleration? Is there any contract losses we should know about? And then secondly, on the international revenue growth, it was a little lower than we expected. Byron, maybe you can just help me through that again because I know cross-border was up 7%, so it's a little bit below cross-border growth. And usually, international revenue growth sometimes is above cross-border.\nByron H. Pollitt: Okay. So I would say in looking over the Rest of World that there were no contract losses material to speak of. In fact, I can't even think of one. So it's much more economic. And as we look at kind of the cross-border as well as the domestic spend inside the Rest of World countries, both of them put on the brakes a bit. Now recognize, Brian, these are still, for the most part, robust growth rates with that we would love to aspire to here in the United States. But in terms of feeling light there, at least in the fourth quarter, there was a bit of a downshift that's -- I think it's economically driven. And with regards to just -- I know 4 weeks does not a trend make, but October was a bit encouraging as it looks like there was a bit of a bounce back in the month of October as it relates to Rest of World cross-border, as well as Rest of World processed transactions, both of which we have real-time visibility too. With regards to international revenue. Let's see. We had nominal cross-border growth of 7%, and we had international fee growth of 5%. And if I look back over the last 3 or 4 quarters, there is always kind of plus or minus 2 or 3 percentage points of noise. I don't think there is any particular callout as I look at the drivers of international fees. It's just -- so I think we're pretty close to the nominal cross-border growth and no real callouts.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: I wondered can you just maybe put a little more color on what you're seeing in the way of spending in Asia and the U.S.? Any changes in behavior, consumers or corporate customers in terms of the spending mix plus T&E?\nJoseph W. Saunders: There has been a clear increase over the year credit spending of more affluent people. A lot of what's going on even in the U.S. economy is driven by consumer spending, as I'm sure you know as well or better than I do. And I think that most of these things have exhibited some sustainability. There are different blips in a few countries around the world and in Asia in particular that are associated with specific events. Some of the noise between China and Japan has hurt some of the volume between those 2 countries in the cross-border volume and the payment volume in particular. And there have been other examples of similar situations. On the bias, though, things are proceeding as well as we expected given the overriding macroeconomic situation. And we're very happy where we wound up in 2012, including the fourth quarter, and we'll have to go from there. As Byron said earlier and as I said, we can't totally avoid what's going on in the global economy. But I think that the -- we're certainly positioned to do well next year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Bruce of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: My question relates specifically to V.me, and I recognize that it's early days. You gave some very encouraging information earlier. I was wondering if you could maybe provide some insight as to what you think it will take to close the gap on the remaining top 10 issuers? And separately, if you think that either 2013 guidance already incorporates some of the pickup in spending on V.me, or if you think that's really more of a 2014 and forward event, please.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, the answer to the last part of the question first, I think, is more of a 2014 event. I mean, going back to the Internet, there were $327 billion spent on the -- or, excuse me, there was $226 billion spent in 2012. People expect that to move to $327 billion by 2016, which I mentioned in my earlier comments. We have a extraordinarily significant share of that volume. It is the fastest-growing category we have without V.me. And I think V.me will enable us to increase our share of the transactions. So not only are we going to be dealing in a category that's increasing, and even though that category may be taking some sales away from in-store sales, I think we will get a larger share of those sales than we have in the past. Any time you do something like we're doing with V.me, it's a chicken-and-egg kind of a thing. What comes first, all the merchants or all the customers? We're running at a pretty rapid rate as it relates to putting both on, and I think we'll have a successful start-up this holiday season. I think that by the middle of the year, we will have a much more robust environment. And by the -- and by a year from now, we'll be poised to take significant advantage of what we've done. As it relates to closing the gap in the top 10, I don't like to speak for my customers before they speak for themselves. But I am looking forward to and I think you could legitimately look forward to hearing a lot more about new additions in the very near future.\nOperator: Our final question will be from Craig Maurer of CLSA.\nCraig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Couple of questions. One, are there any unique or specific profit aspirations for V.me other than gaining share in e-commerce? And secondly, decoupled debit, TSYS commented that their fastest-growing debit customer now is a decoupled debit customer. And it's pretty clear to us that the MCX merchants are going to launch with decoupled debits. So my question is, has something changed in decoupled debits since Capital One failed at that attempt 2 years ago that would make you a bit more nervous of that product?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, I don't think anything that I'm aware of has happened that should precipitate that. And, of course, that failed because they couldn't bundle transactions. They had to have specific -- they had to be able to specifically list each transaction, which they were unable to do. As it relates to MCX, I mean, I think they have lofty aspirations, and they probably have a lot of horsepower to work with. I think we're aware of what we're doing, and -- I mean, we're aware of what they're doing, and they're aware of what we're doing. And we're working hard to compete. And I don't think that, that in itself is going to define who Visa is or isn't in the near- or the moderate-term.\nJack Carsky: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, all, for your participation today.

We are pleased to have the opportunity today to review our third quarter performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering against our strategy. Visa had another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 10% increase over the same period last year. After adjusting for our previously announced litigation reserve, net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 20% increase over the same period last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.56, a 25% increase over the fiscal quarter of 2011. So with 3 strong quarters of operational performance behind us, which include insights into both the initial adverse Durbin impacts and our fiscal fourth quarter services revenues, we are now adjusting our 2012 EPS growth guidance to low 20s. And we continue to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. We used $461 million of our excess cash to repurchase 4 million shares during the fiscal third quarter. Looking ahead, our board has authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program. You've heard this before but it's worth repeating, the shift from cash and checks to digital currency is a global trend that we expect to continue well into the future. Today, more than 30% of global consumer spending, almost $10 trillion, remains on cash and checks worldwide. Interestingly, despite Visa's success increasing penetration of electronic payments over the past several years, the total opportunity to take share from cash and checks worldwide has actually expanded since our IPO, driven primarily by global population growth and expansion of many emerging economies where electronic payments currently represent a relatively small percentage of personal consumption expenditures. But we're never content just to benefit from evolving demographics, Visa is taking action to accelerate growth beyond the secular trend. To do so, we are focused on building and expanding the entire payments category in every market that we operate. That means in our partnership -- that means in partnership with our financial institution clients, putting more payment products in more people's hands, tapping entirely new market segments with diverse product offerings, expanding the places where Visa products are accepted and innovating next-generation payment technologies that create a superior payment experience for account holders and add value to financial institutions and merchants. And as we are successful in expanding the overall payments category, Visa's business benefits through diversity and resiliency, which helped us continue to grow through the past economic cycles. So while we are closely watching economic conditions that could impact Visa's business, including fallout from continued volatility in Europe and softening outlooks for both China and Brazil, our underlying business drivers remain strong. To begin my business review, let's first discuss the United States where credit posted yet another strong quarter, with payment volumes increasing 10%, Visa's fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category. In addition to strength in the overall category, I'm confident we picked up share in credit as we've added new clients and built upon Visa's strong existing client relationships. Turning to U.S. debit, the situation continues to play out as expected and in line with our guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012 and '13. During the June quarter, Visa's aggregate debit payments volume growth in the U.S. was negative 9%, as our clients complied with the April regulatory deadlines. This was driven by the fall off of Interlink payment volumes, which came in line with our projections. Meanwhile, Visa Debit, which excludes Interlink, posted healthy mid single-digit payment volume growth, which we expect to continue. As predicted during last quarter's call, I am confident Visa experienced the trough for U.S. debit payment volumes during the fiscal quarter, and we are now seeing signs of improved performance in the fourth fiscal quarter. That being said and as we have stated previously, we recognize that some debit share loss resulting from this regulation will be permanent. As for implementation of our debit strategies to compete for merchant routing and win issuer business, I will simply say I am pleased with our progress and confident in our long-term position. Our efforts remain on track, and our strategies are gaining traction. We are absolutely delivering the value we promised to our merchant and financial institution clients, and equally important, the strategies are delivering on Visa's own financial and operational expectations. As for the CID, the status is essentially unchanged since our last call. I remain comfortable our actions are appropriate, and we continue to be in regular contact with the department providing information as requested. I'll keep you updated if and when the situation warrants. Switching gears, I'd like to briefly provide my perspective on the proposed merchant litigation settlement announced earlier this month. We reached a reasonable outcome that ensures the long-term health and competitiveness of the payments industry in the United States. Importantly, our current guidance for fiscal 2012 and '13 fully takes this agreement into account. I am pleased that we have settlements after an extensive process, coordinated by court-appointed mediators, which have been approved by class representatives, class counsel and the retailers who filed separate suits. We anticipate these will have support among the retail community in the U.S. because it is a fair and an appropriate compromise for all parties, and that the agreement will be approved by the court. As for the next steps, preliminary court approval of this agreement is expected in the fall, and Visa is preparing to begin implementation in the early part of 2013. Bottom line, we are moving towards ending a 7-year dispute with an important constituency of our client base: merchants. And we are doing so in a reasonable and responsible way. Looking ahead, we are actively looking for opportunities to work collaboratively with the U.S. merchant community to advance our mutual agendas. In particular, we believe that investments we are making in next-generation payment technologies, V.me, mobile payments and merchant offers, will drive considerable value to merchants. Now let's shift the discussion to Visa's international business where we continue to focus on driving long-term growth. Breaking down our specific regions in constant dollars, payment volumes in Asia Pacific grew 13%, Canada at 8%, while CEMEA and Latin America posted gains of 41% and 20%, respectively, in the June quarter. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, a top priority is building the payments category globally. To that end, we continue to execute a targeted investment strategy in several geographies with significant growth potential, deploying locally tailored acceleration plans to substantially increase Visa's revenue over a 5-year horizon. So let me give you a few specific examples to demonstrate our progress. In Russia, over 80% of consumer spending is still cash-based, which presents a significant opportunity. To drive future growth, Visa is intensely focused on expanding usage in every day spend merchant categories, including supermarkets, a strategy that aligns particularly well with our strong stable of debit cards in that country. During the most recent quarter, Visa launched acceptance at Mutney [ph], the country's largest grocery chain, with more than 5,000 stores. In fact, with the addition of Mutney [ph], Visa now is accepted at the 4 largest food retail chains in Russia, a major step towards accelerated growth in that country. At the same time, in the Middle East, we are building on our traditionally strong position with a fluent [ph] and Shariah-compliant credit products, working with clients to expand debits. As one example of our success, Visa recently secured a significant multiproduct extension with the National Bank of Kuwait. A key element of our strategy is increased investment in local expertise and local engagement. To that end, we recently opened our first offices in Doha, in Abu Dhabi, as well as doubled the size of our presence in Dubai to serve clients better across the Middle East and the CEMEA region generally. And in East Africa, a region I recently visited, we are investing now to reap long-term returns. We recently opened a regional headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, an important opportunity in that geography is using our Fundamo platform to deploy mobile solutions and drive long-term growth. We are also making steady progress in Rwanda, which offers a case study of how Visa can proactively engage governments and align our own growth agenda with domestic priorities. In that regard, we are working with the Rwandan government to increase access to and usage of electronic payments in that country. A key priority is financial inclusion and literacy using mobile technology. Additionally, Visa is now processing domestic payments and interbank ATM withdrawals, an important step forward for this emerging economy. Also, our efforts will help increase tourism volumes from international travelers, a key driver of economic activity and a top government priority. Finally, this effort should be the foundation for our activities in the entire East African region. Expect us to talk to you more about this in the future. We're also making steady progress in Indonesia, a rapidly expanding economy with a growing affluent middle class and a population, fast approaching 250 million. A key element of our strategy here is growing acceptance. To that end, Visa signed a multiphase, multiyear card acceptance promotion with the country's largest petrol chain, Pertamina, with more than 4,000 gas stations nationwide and approximately $30 billion in sales volume annually, the promotion will help expand the acceptance of Visa credit and debit cards over the next few years. Most recently, during the last quarter, CyberSource, Visa's 2010 acquisition, signed a number of deals to accelerate e-commerce acceptance, including one with a national airline, Garuda, to provide payment, gateway and fraud management services. Meanwhile, in China, I know you are already aware of the World Trade Organization's final report containing the findings of the case between the U.S. and Chinese governments concerning China's domestic electronic payments marketplace. While we are still assessing its implications, we are hopeful the ruling ultimately could provide for more global entrants into China's payment marketplace. Although, a number of additional steps still need to be taken in the WTO process before we have any clarity or certainty. Most importantly to Visa, we continue to make strategic investments to expand our existing business in China. To that end, we executed several long-term client partnerships during the quarter, including multiyear extensions with CITIC Bank and China Minsheng Banking Corporation. We also secured a new relationship with Bank of Communication. Overall, our focus is on advancing our partnership with local banks and China UnionPay to serve consumers and businesses using our existing 78 million co-badge cards when traveling abroad. In fact, earlier this week, Visa cosponsored a payment security symposium with China UnionPay. The symposium was hosted by The Payment and Clearing Association of China. It was under the endorsement of the People's Bank of China. During this event, Ellen Richey, our Chief Enterprise Risk Officer joined banking executives, regulators and law enforcement in Beijing to speak about Visa's role in payment security in the fast-growing Chinese market. And finally, we are 2 days away from the start of the 2012 Olympic Games. There's a reason that Visa has been a sponsor of the Olympic games for more than a quarter of a century. No sponsorship platform offers a better opportunity to help our clients around the world grow their businesses while also driving incremental transaction revenue for Visa. Over the past 13 Olympic Summer Games and Winter Olympic Games, this sponsorship has provided Visa with a global platform to amplify our brand message among a passionate global fan base, then drive tangible business results. We work with our clients to tailor their Olympic-related activities to address the unique needs of their own business and geography, including cardholder acquisition, retention or increasing usage. This year, I am pleased that Visa has engaged a record number of clients in our program, with more than 1,000 financial institutions and merchants worldwide activating Olympic-related activities, including a large portion from priority growth markets. This represents a 70% increase from our program in Beijing and positions us for a highly successful event over the next 2 weeks. So to wrap up, our strong performance during the fiscal quarter demonstrates the underlying strength and resilience of Visa's business model. We continued to accelerate the migration away from cash and check to electronic payments. We helped our clients grow their core business lines. We expanded our footprint in international markets, both emerging and established. We advanced our innovation agenda. And we took significant steps to resolve critical business issues. As always, I remain highly confident in the future of Visa. And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron.\nByron H. Pollitt: Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some observations and call-outs. First, note that we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We eliminated the previously disclosed litigation accruals associated with both the MOU in the merchants litigation and the preliminary agreement with the individual plaintiff, since both of these events are covered by our retrospective responsibility plan. These accruals, which totaled $4.1 billion, resulted in a quarterly after-tax loss of $1.8 billion on a GAAP basis. Excluding these litigation accruals, we reported solid earnings per share of $1.56 for the quarter. Second, the all-in impact from U.S. debit regulation, which includes restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, cost us about $0.04 in EPS for the quarter. We expect a similar, if not slightly higher impact in the next few quarters, as more of our debit volume is exposed to lower variable fees and incentive agreements. As we have stated before, this is already incorporated into our guidance. Third, foreign tax credits resulted in a benefit of $56 million or $0.08 to our adjusted diluted EPS this quarter. These tax credits were contemplated in our full year guidance, with the amount recognized in the third quarter representing the total for the year. Fourth, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth, most recently 10% in the quarter. Through the 21st of July, credit payment volume growth has comped at a 9% rate, consistent with a somewhat tepid but sustained U.S. economic recovery. Fifth, as anticipated, aggregate U.S. debit posted a negative 9% growth rate in the third quarter, led by Interlink payment volume, which was off 54%. So far, the month of April has proven to be the trough in debit payment volume loss. And since then, we have seen sequential monthly progress during the quarter in recapturing portions of this Interlink volume. Importantly, Visa Debit, which excludes Interlink, continued to post solid mid-single-digit payment volume growth. Sixth, client incentives for the quarter, as a percent of gross revenue, were 19%, consistent with our full year guidance range, which is weighted to the back half of the year. Higher incentives had 2 drivers: First, pricing adjustments linked to our U.S. debit mitigation strategies, which are expected to continue and potentially grow as our merchant and acquirer agreements take hold; and second, certain Rest of World incentives, which are not expected to repeat in the fourth quarter. Lastly, in late May, we received from the IRS a notice of proposed adjustment for our fiscal 2008 federal income tax return. This notice would disallow the deduction and associated tax benefit related to payments made in 2008 toward the American Express litigation. We disagree with this proposed adjustment. We are comfortable defending our position, and importantly, we made no changes to our tax estimates relating to this deduction or any similar deductions for covered litigation in subsequent fiscal years. Resolution of these types of tax matters generally take some time to conclude. Now, let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global, payment volume and processed transaction trends for the quarter, followed by our results through July 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012. Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars was 6%, down from the March quarter's normalized 10% after adjusting for the leap year. Several call-outs: first, combined credit growth for both the U.S. and Rest of World held steady versus a normalized prior quarter, both produced double-digit growth; second, Rest of World debit growth was unchanged at 28%, same as the normalized second quarter rate; third, more recently through July 21, U.S. payment volume growth was flat, comprised of 9% credit growth and minus 7% for debit. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 14% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter, which compares to a normalized 15% rate in the second quarter. The U.S. grew 11% and the Rest of World, 16%. We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and CEMEA regions. Through July 21, cross-border volumes, on a constant dollar basis, grew 12%, with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and the Rest of World at 13%. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $13.1 billion in the fiscal third quarter, a 1% increase over the prior year period. A debit-led decline of 3% in the U.S. was offset by 18% growth in Rest of World. For the month of July through the 21, processed transaction growth was a positive 2%, driven by an improving trajectory in U.S. processed transaction growth. Separately, CyberSource reported 1.3 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year. Three call-outs: First, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is being felt by our Interlink product where transaction growth will continue to be negative until we lap the implementation of the rules next year; second, Visa processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. Credit and Rest of World; finally, although there appear to be darkening economic clouds, our global revenue drivers remain healthy with no clear signals of a downturn at this point in time. Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 10% increase year-over-year. After hedges, there was no meaningful foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter. Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 15% over the prior year period. This reflects strong payment volume growth in the March quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the June quarter. Data processing revenue was $1 billion, up 17% over the prior year's quarter, based on solid growth rates for CyberSource transactions and Visa processed transactions outside of the U.S., as well as competitive pricing actions that became effective in the quarter. As a reminder, the fixed acquirer network fee initiated in the third quarter is booked to data processing revenue. Offsetting merchant and acquirer incentives are reflected in the contra revenue incentive line, which I'll cover in a moment. Turning to a different metric. We saw a step-up in the gross revenue data processing yield, due in part to strategic pricing adjustments, but also driven by the steep decline in Interlink transactions in the quarter, which are by far our lowest yielding product. International transaction revenue was up 13% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes, with low double-digit growth rates in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in the Rest of World as measured on a constant dollar basis. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 19%. The fourth fiscal quarter will also see an elevated level, but is likely to be slightly less than Q3. Together, these incentive levels are consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. While we are not yet prepared to offer a more detailed view of fiscal 2013 incentives, we do expect a modest increase from the 2012 level of 17% to 18%. Total adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 10% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our investments in growth-related technology projects. Marketing expenses of $242 million reflect a heavier weighting of spend in the second half of the year, timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 58%, bringing our fiscal year-to-date to 61%, consistent with our guidance of about 60% for the year. The third quarter's margin is in line with our expectation for expense timing, as we realize a second ramp-up in incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. Capital expenditures were $108 million in the quarter and are $235 million year-to-date. Given our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year, we will likely come in at the lower end of that range. Our adjusted tax rate for Q3 was 29.2%, and as I mentioned at the outset, was positively impacted by a $56 million benefit from foreign tax credits. The amount recognized represents the total for the year. During the quarter, we spent $461 million to repurchase 4 million shares at an average price of $115.51 per share. Our board recently authorized a new repurchase plan totaling $1 billion, effective through July of 2013. Separate from the share repurchase program, on July 24, we added an incremental $150 million to the escrow account. The fourth quarter event will reduce the B share conversion ratio to 0.4206, thereby reducing the A equivalent share count by 1.2 million shares. At the end of the June quarter, we had 670 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The adjusted weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the third quarter totaled $675 million. Finally, we are making only one adjustment to our outstanding 2012 fiscal guidance, other than the minor notes I've addressed. Given where we are year-to-date, we are eliminating high teens from our EPS growth guidance and going with just low 20s. As is our custom, we plan to fully address our 2013 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: If you -- I was hoping you could flesh out a little bit the steps that you've taken now that we're kind of 3 months further in with respect to the debit acquiring fee and you've talked about some of the effects. But what's actually happened? How much of that has been implemented? And could you talk a little bit about how that's kind of been -- how that has flowed through the numbers?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, we're -- I'm not exactly sure about the specific question, but I'll -- there were 2 significant things that we did, one was the pricing and one was the paid or the debit card change. So from a fixed pricing point of view, that's been fully implemented. From a paid or a debit card point of view, that has been significantly implemented, but it's being implemented in phases and it will take a few more months to get it fully done. Remember, however, that we retained the Interbank logo on the majority of our largest customers. And so none of that volume, as long as the Interlink logo is there, will go through paid.[ph]\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.\nDaniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So what I was thinking is now that you have at least arrived at this settlement proposal, I'm wondering if you're thinking about the utilization of your free cash flow differently from what we've seen over the past several years since you funded the escrow account. And then secondly as you talk about the investments that you think are going to be important to the merchants, when we look at the incremental margins in the quarter versus sort of past couple of years, we're kind of at a low level -- or certainly [ph] close to a trough level. And I'm wondering if we should be thinking about the investments going forward at these more incremental margin levels.\nByron H. Pollitt: So let me take the first one. We have no change whatsoever in our philosophy of returning excess cash to shareholders. To the extent that we are not placing cash in the escrow account, the alternative would be open market repurchases of our A shares, and that is exactly what we intend to focus on. So no change on that front, as further evidenced by the approval by the board to authorize a new $1 billion dollar share repurchase program. Second, with regards to margins -- let me reframe that, last year, we delivered about a 60% operating margin. That is our guidance for this year. The lower margins, that operating margins you're seeing in this quarter and we'll see again in the next quarter are all consistent with our guidance of about 60% for this year. As you may recall from our -- at the beginning of the year earnings call, beginning of fiscal year, we indicated that it would be about 60% for the year, but that we would be a little higher in the first half of the year and a little lower in the second half of the year, largely due to a ramp-up in technology investments and a weighted marketing spend for the Olympics timed with the second half. So this year, past year, about 60%, and we'll let you know what '13 looks like in another quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays.\nDarrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Can you first start off, you said in the past you would expect an acceleration of revenue growth in fiscal year '13, I think, versus 2012 levels. Can you just comment on the main drivers of that, especially if you expect incentives to be sequentially higher year-over-year next year?\nByron H. Pollitt: So what we said was -- or meant to communicate was that this was a comment around the implementation of the Durbin rules. And that what we expected is that once we had annualized the impact of Durbin, which will take us through the first 2 fiscal quarters of next year, once we have lapped those rules and the Durbin impacts were in our base, at that point, everything else being equal, we would expect an acceleration, particularly in our -- specifically focused on our debit business because we've got the Durbin impact now in our base. So that's what we meant by that. Everything else being equal, we would expect to see it. Again, with regards to revenue growth for next year, we'll be much more specific about that on the next quarter call.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Yes. So, Byron, just to follow up to that, does that mean your fiscal '13 guidance signal is not relating to overall revenue growth? It's just related -- it's just relating to the growth in your debit business in the U.S? And then I guess the follow-up to that is that you indicated that your growth trends are not showing much effect from macro issues and you've had a string of pretty good incremental wins that are presumably offsetting what appears to be a general slowing in retail spending. Is there any way to quantify the recent contribution in your growth rate from new wins that are occurring as an offset to the cyclical pressures that are out there?\nByron H. Pollitt: So let me -- yes, let me -- I'll go first in responding to that. So the guidance, the specific quantitative guidance we have for next year for '13, number one, is EPS growth in the high teens; number two, incentives that are modestly, slightly higher than what we expect to experience this year. That's the extent to which we've guided to '13. And remember, when we said we expect revenues to generate, that's everything else being equal. We expect to have debit -- the U.S. debit part of the business annualized halfway in through the year. So in order -- I mean honestly, to give a much more informed perspective on revenue growth for next year, we'll wait to the fourth quarter call at which point we'll have much better visibility of what we're looking at going in. Meanwhile, we are reconfirming the guidance that we currently have for fiscal year '13. With regards to incremental wins, you can say we have some, certainly on the credit side. We don't have -- we have the opposite, so to speak, courtesy of the U.S. government on the debit side. And so in balancing those and looking at the current underlying revenue drivers of cross-border volume growth, transaction growth, inside the U.S., outside the U.S., that's really what's underpinning our guidance comments for '13 -- for balance of year and for '13 to date. Joe?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Yes. I don't think that there is a significant amount of traction yet on some of the credit wins in the United States. So I don't believe that, that's where the growth is coming from. But certainly it is cause for optimism as it relates to our credit volumes going forward. I would also reference a lot of our wins outside of the United States, which are picking up steam as we talked about and will provide revenue. And I'm sure, as Byron has pointed out, that everybody understands, a lot of our '13 guidance was a reflection on how we would fare given the Durbin legislation. Right now, our metrics in every other regard are quite strong. And we will, as Byron said, address our expectations next quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.\nGlenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I applaud your comments about working more collaboratively with merchants. The fact is though, we're just now hopefully turning the chapter on a relationship that's had tension involved for many, many years. So this is a big step forward for both sides, positive step forward. But besides the technology that you alluded to earlier, I mean how difficult do you think it will be to change your overall cultural approach and just general relationship overall with the merchants from a very high level, aside from the actual product level?\nJoseph W. Saunders: There's been a, I suppose that you could characterize for the last 7 years, as a contentious relationship. But the fact of the matter is when you look at the history of the usage of electronic payments, it's been growing quite rapidly during that period of time. So I'd characterize it as a kind of a love-hate relationship, I mean something that you sometimes can't do with and what generally you can't do without. And I think that we are in a position to reach out and do much more going forward, particularly because of the technology that we're embracing that will bring a new level of value to the merchant community. And I'm very, very optimistic about it. We work with the merchant community through all of this, even as you talk about what's going on right now or as certain merchants may complain about this or that. Remember, we have incentive contracts with a significant number of them. And so we are working with them. We're dealing with them on a daily basis, and we think that those relations will improve as time goes on. Certainly, that's going to be our endeavor.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Williams with UBS.\nJohn T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just very quickly, Byron, I just wanted to get more detail on your comment that you said you're seeing no clear signs of a slowdown. I think if you look at the other folks in the industry, American Express is the one that really comes to mind. Do you have anything to say regarding the affluent calling out high-end versus low-end differences that you might have seen, maybe traveling hotels or any other somewhat discretionary verticals that you might have seen some change in behavior over the last few months?\nByron H. Pollitt: I think it's too early to make that conclusion. John, what we do is watch -- we break down the quarter month-to-month. And there can be some very wide differentials within a given quarter. Let me give you an example. In the quarter just completed for U.S. credit, we grew 8% in the month of April, 12% in the month of May, 10% in the month of June. All-in, it delivered 10% growth. And so when we look at the monthly kind of progression over the past couple of quarters, these are all -- they bounce around month-to-month, but they're all pretty healthy. And so I think the hardest part of a trend to call is the beginning. And given the kind of healthy growth rates we're experiencing, it's -- we just don't see a discernible trend. But I promise you, we will update everyone quarter-by-quarter, and would be happy to go through monthly progressions to help give a better flavor for this. So I'm not saying it's not happening, just saying we're not seeing it yet.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just wanted to ask a few questions on the litigation settlement. So what's the process in dealing with the merchants that opt out? And also, what's the plan for the, I guess I'd call it, overfunded litigation escrow? How are you going to deal with that as the Class B shares come unlocked? And then lastly, maybe -- don't be mad, Jack. Just what's the -- in terms of the surcharge, no surcharge rule going away, how much volume in earnings do you estimate will be at risk by allowing surcharging in the U.S.?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, I'll answer the question about surcharging, and then I'm going to let our counsel who watched over this litigation for the past 7 years make some comments about the rest of your question. We think that the position that we struck, and if you look at the MOU and you look at all of the details of surcharging and how it can be affected and what the caps are and so forth and so on, we think it's a fair settlement. And we do not look at surcharging per se as it relates to this litigation as something that will -- it significantly affect us at all. I mean, that's our feeling about it. That's our position. We could talk about this for hours, and of course we have and we did before. We agreed to do anything, and we'll just have to let it unfold. But I think it's a -- I think that the settlement is a reasonable settlement for both sides. Josh?\nJoshua R. Floum: Thanks, Joe. As to the process going forward, we are very confident that the court is going to approve this settlement. And the reason I say this is this case has been pending for 7 years. And during a great deal of that time, there has been a court-ordered mediation process with 2 mediators and the involvement of the court. And at the end of that time, all of the class counsel, the class representatives, the individual merchants, as well as the financial institution defendants have agreed to the deal. It's a fair and reasonable deal. And therefore, we're comfortable that at the end of the day, the court is going to approve the settlement.\nByron H. Pollitt: And with regards to the, Tien-Tsin, the unlocking of the shares, we've had a lot of practice with the unlocking of the C shares. And as a result, we are very confident that when that time comes, we'll be able to manage that with barely a ripple with regards to impact on stock price.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.\nJason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Why don't I just pick up on that question, if I could. And just thinking out beyond the court approval coming in the fall that you guys expect, can you guys just clarify what sort of true legal recourse the retailers that choose to opt out of the settlement, what kind of legal recourse they actually have? Obviously a couple of the biggest have publicly announced that they do not support the settlement, which probably doesn't surprise anybody. But if you can just clarify for all of us what kind of legal recourse they actually have when and if they formally opt out, that would be great.\nJoshua R. Floum: Right, the way the deal is structured is that opt-outs, and you always expect a couple in a class action lawsuit, can sue only for monetary relief. There's something called a non-opt-out class for injunctive relief. What that means is that all of Visa and MasterCard's rules in existence as of the time of approval are released both by the opt-ins and the opt-outs.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just want to ask about the mid-single-digit growth in the Visa Debit line. I guess I thought that number would be a little bit higher. Has that trended down over the last couple of quarters? And then if it has, what might be driving a little bit slower growth in Visa Debit? Is it a move towards PIN, loss of share, Durbin?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, I mean, we always expected to have some deterioration in the magnitude of that growth number. And as a matter of fact, it's doing better than we had originally anticipated. Remember, when the whole Durbin thing came, and you had a number of debit cards with rewards associated with them, it drove financial institutions to promote it much more heavily. It encouraged consumers to use it considerably more. And so part of the whole Durbin legislation was a little bit of a damper on debit card transactions in general. Not that they were going to stop, it's just that the rate of growth was going to slow down. So we're actually quite happy with where we are.\nByron H. Pollitt: And I'll just add a little quantitative perspective. We were -- in the fourth fiscal quarter of '11, we were kind of at the upper end of mid-single digits in that category. We've remained in that range for Qs 1, 2 and 3. And if you look at Q2 on a normalized basis, pulling out the leap year, the growth rates for Q2 and Q3 are identical. So I would say this is a -- with the overlay of what Joe said in terms of kind of a modest level of impact, it has been relatively sustained during this fiscal year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Wayne Johnson with Raymond James.\nWayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: This question is for Joe. Could you give us an update on how V.me is progressing for commercial launch? Is Visa still on track with that? And if you could just provide kind of initial expectations how we should see this rollout this fall?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, yes, I think we are right on track with the Click-to-buy and aliasing capability that we suggest that we would rollout by the end of the year. It is up. It is live. It is running. We have -- we currently have 6 relatively large merchants on the system. We do not have a significant number of consumers at this particular point in time. But we're on schedule with several financial institutions to begin that in the very near future. And so right now, we're still anticipating a holiday season rollout of the project. And of course it'll gain a lot more traction in 2013 than it will at the beginning of 2012. But we're happy with the progress, we're happy with the performance and we're happy with where we are, both with the merchant community and with financial institutions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.\nTimothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Could you talk a bit about anything you've seen in Latin America, looking at sort of the regional data, constant currency, that one seemed to show more of a slowdown at least for the June data, while all the other regions sort of held steady. So I'm curious that there might be something relative to that economy or country that impacted those numbers that might be in play for a couple more quarters. And then, if I could slip one other in, just any thoughts around the average credit ticket in the U.S., which had been climbing steadily out of the recession and now seems to be in a slightly sort of negative position. Is that fuel? Or is there something else you might think would account for that trend in the last couple of quarters?\nByron H. Pollitt: Let me start with the Latin America. With regards to currency -- first of all, let me just mention to the group that we do hedge exposures. So whatever impact, with the exception of 2 countries, which I'll turn to in a moment, we can dampen the impact on FX. With regards to currency-specific countries, we are seeing a depreciation in Argentina and a continued depreciation in Venezuela. The outlook for devaluation, I would say, is nothing's a certainty, but I -- at some point, it looks like we're heading to that. And you can't -- there's no economic hedge for either one of those 2 currencies. So is that a bit of a drag on our Latin America business? Yes. Is it hedgeable? No. And so -- but that's baked into the numbers we reported. With regards to any other country call-out, I would say Brazil has tempered a bit. There has been a tax placed on credit usage for cross-border travel, which has definitely put a bit of a break on the exuberance of the Brazilians to see the world. That tax is not applied to debit, but it is applied to credit. And so I would say overall, particularly the rest of Latin America that the business is strong. It has very, very healthy growth rates, unimpeded by shifts in currency. Average credit ticket, no substantive change in that metric for the moment. But if you'd like something more specific, I'm sure if you call our IR group, Jack or Victoria would be able to give you something more specific.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Two questions. One, a question for counsel relating to a previous answer, when you say opt-outs can sue only for monetary relief, does that include relief from interchange? And secondly, for Byron, the yield on processed transactions in the quarter jumped significantly, which was expected, but it was a lot more than what we were looking for. Do you think that the yield posted in the quarter is a good one to think about going forward?\nByron H. Pollitt: Let me start with the yield question. So the yield increase in the data processing category absolutely was expected. Remember a couple of things as perspective, that as part of our Durbin mitigation strategies, we are -- we implemented a fixed acquiring network fee, which is completely captured in the DP category. We also reduced variable transaction fees, which are also included in the DP category. But we then introduced a degree of incentive offset, and that appears in a completely different line. So while the growth yield for DP goes up, it's not a true picture. And instead, you really ought to be looking at net yield, which I'll come back to in a minute, as it relates to Visa Inc. revenue yield. With regards to the DP yield, there's one other factor involved, which will -- which has an impact on the calculation, which is our lowest yielding product is Interlink. So as -- and that has borne the brunt of the loss as we conform to the new rules. And so as Interlink moves out of the denominator in terms of yield calculation, it has the least impact on the numerator and automatically, the yield moves up. And so you have both of those indicators going forward. There are a number of factors impacting the DP line. Debit is one, including Interlink; CyberSource booked into the DP line. And so I think what it's going to take is the next 2 or 3 quarters or so in order for us to kind of reset what the base trend lines ought to be projected off of with regards to data processing. So I think -- wish I could be more helpful, but I think it's going to take another couple of quarters before this sorts out. When you put all of this together and you look at the Visa Inc. revenue yield, of which DP is an important component, but that captures the incentives. In the way that we capture and measure yield, our yield for the third fiscal quarter of '12 is actually flat with the yield we experienced in the third quarter of '11, fiscal year '11. So a lot of moving parts. This is where we're sorting out, and I'm afraid it's just going to take 2 or 3 quarters before we can we reset the different trend lines on the different fee categories.\nJoshua R. Floum: And as to your first question, opt-out merchants can only sue for monetary damages. And by the way, those claims would be covered under our retrospective responsibility plan. Claims for things like rate relief or interchange reductions, that's in the nature of injunctive relief. And opt-outs cannot make those claims.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: It sounds like you guys are still see some reasonably good underlying organic growth globally, and I'm just wondering how we reconcile that with kind of the darkening clouds commentary you mentioned before. And then secondarily, I was just wondering if you could talk about the -- how the tax benefit will be utilized in terms of the litigation escrow reserve build.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, Byron, why don't you answer the second?\nByron H. Pollitt: Yes, I'll do the first one. With regards to the litigation of the -- how the tax impact will be utilized, there's a different treatment for GAAP, and it's a different treatment for cash flow. So for GAAP, we go ahead as soon as it's probable and estimable, which we concluded it was, we go ahead and put that through the income statement. So on a GAAP basis, that's now behind us. With regards to the cash flow impact, you can't record the deduction on your return until you actually make a payment. And so the payments associated with this are potentially some time out. And so there will be no cash flow impact this year associated with that once the agreement is -- once we're further along -- much further along in the litigation process, we'll be in a position to actually make payments, at which point we can then take the tax deduction. We'll give you some perspective on that on the fourth quarter call.\nJoseph W. Saunders: And as it relates to your first question, we -- I mentioned in my comments that the demographics of the world are changing, the number of places that accept electronic payments are increasing. And so there is some countercyclical things that occur and allow us to build volume even when economies are slowing down to some extent. That's always the difficulty we have in calling out what's going on in the world or what do we see or how do we measure or know exactly what's happening. And it's tough because more and more people have access to electronic payments, and more and more locations accept electronic payments. And those have to be factored into the equation.\nOperator: And the last question does come from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.\nGlenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I'll just ask on the U.S. debit volume trends. You sort of saw -- I mean, through May, I think you gave us an update, it was sort of negative 8 end of the quarter, kind of negative 9. And encouragingly, it sort of looks like it improved in July to negative 7. So I mean, I guess the question -- or do you think we're sort of in a sustained, improved trajectory? And obviously the pricing efforts are having some effect here, but where do you think we go from here?\nByron H. Pollitt: We're in uncharted waters. We like the notion that it's an improving trajectory. And we will -- honestly, we'll know better how competitors respond to our strategies, and I think this is still very early days in terms of trying to project how this will play out. Remember, the rules only went into effect April 1. So we've only had, what, 3 months and 3 weeks of operation under these new rules. And to date, we're pleased with how our strategies have taken hold to start, and we'll report on how well they continue to perform in the upcoming quarters.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Without making an absolute prediction on the heels of what Byron just said though, I will remind you what I said in the remarks I made earlier, and that is there will be a permanent deterioration in our debit card volume as a result of the Durbin legislation. There's absolutely no question about it. So when we talk about waiting and seeing, we're kind of waiting to see where it gets to, but I don't expect to be -- I don't expect to be close to where we were when the whole thing started.\nJack Carsky: Well, that wraps it up. Thank you, all for joining us today, and thank you to Josh Floum for his comments earlier, our special guest star. If anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to call Victoria or myself.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. The call has concluded.

And as always, thank you for joining us today.  Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth globally, continued outperformance of credit spend worldwide and a strong cross-border activity.  Adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 23% increase over the same period last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.60, a 30% increase over the second fiscal quarter of 2011.  Our performance reaffirms Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and service offerings, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide.  With 2 strong quarters under our belt and insight into our fiscal third quarter service revenues, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance.  Visa's global business continues to expand at a healthy pace. A strong March quarter followed the solid results we posted in our first quarter and will drive service revenues in the current June quarter. During the March quarter, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes worldwide grew 14% and 7%, respectively. Cross-border volume also posted healthy gains, increasing 16% globally. Processed transactions grew 8%.  In the U.S., payment volumes increased 6% for all products. Our star performer for fiscal second quarter was credit. Building on that, we continue to invest in new and expanded long-term credit relationships with our largest U.S. clients to drive growth in our core business. In fact, of the largest U.S. issuers that consider multiyear partnership agreements, we now have 9 of the top 10 signed into fiscal 2015 and beyond. From a volume perspective, that equates to more than 3/4 of our U.S. credit volume secured into 2015 and beyond. During the March quarter, we also continued to have success, winning important new credit business from multiple U.S. issuers.  On the co-brand front, I'm pleased that Visa has finalized a multiyear extension of our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio that benefits from a large number of affluent cardholders and a high cross-border usage. Additionally, we are now seeing early results of our previously announced contract with United Airlines. As a reminder, the recent merger of United and Continental Airlines resulted in the consolidation of their credit card portfolios under MileagePlus, and the combined entity has chosen Visa as the exclusive brand for newly issued MileagePlus cards.  As for acceptance, we are expanding our popular Visa Easy Payment Service, our no-signature-required program in the United States for selected merchant categories. Under our current program, which is available to the majority of merchant categories in the U.S., merchants have the option to complete purchases up to $25 without requiring a cardholder's signature or a PIN. Building on the success of that program, we see an opportunity to help our merchant and financial institution partners better serve their customers, reduce their costs and grow their businesses. That's why beginning in October 2012, we are raising the limit to $50 for discount stores and supermarkets with the intent of expanding this service to additional merchant categories over time.  Now let's turn our attention to Visa's Debit business in the U.S. where the new regulations are now in full effect. After more than a year of thoughtful planning, we have moved beyond the April 1 full compliance deadline. The next several months will be dynamic and highly competitive, but I'm confident with our position and comprehensive strategies.  So far, the situation is playing out as we expected, and in line with our updated guidance for fiscal 2012 as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013. During the March quarter, U.S. aggregate debit payment volumes slowed to 2% growth and, as expected, has continued to decline in April. Interlink is bearing the brunt of the regulatory impact.  To really understand what's happening in our Debit business, it's critical to look at our 2 products, Visa Debit and Interlink, independently. Visa Debit, also known as Visa check cards, saw a modest, albeit slowing, payment volume growth during the March quarter. This slowdown resulted largely from U.S. issuers deemphasizing debit reward programs in their own marketing activities.  Turning to Interlink. We posted negative payment volume growth in each month of the March quarter. More recently, between the compliance deadline of April 1 and April 28, Interlink payment volume has experienced notable deterioration. Keep in mind, though, that in the March quarter, Interlink contributed less than 10% of U.S. debit revenue and about 2% of Visa Inc.'s overall revenue and was our lowest yielding product in the U.S. market. We believe we will experience the greatest impact to U.S. debit payment volumes and recalibration of market share during our fiscal third quarter.  Looking ahead, as our revised debit strategies steadily gain traction, we expect to see improving trajectory in our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter.  For one, the new regulations provided us with an opportunity to add Interlink to existing cards that currently carry our competitor's brand. More importantly, our comprehensive, integrated debit strategy also focuses on winning issue replacement and incenting routing decisions.  On the issuer side, not only have we maintained all of our major issuer relationships for the Visa Debit, we signed 14 of our 15 largest U.S. debit issuers to agreements that go until at least fiscal 2015 with the majority spanning beyond that.  As for our strategies to compete for routing decisions, our incentive program for merchants is on track. We've taken a tailored and surgical approach to win strategic volume and offered competitive incentives to merchants.  Overall, while we are still at the earliest stages, I am confident that our comprehensive debit strategies are working and put Visa in a position to compete effectively in the redefined U.S. debit market. Of course, in any period of substantive change, ongoing communication and clarification with key stakeholders is essential. To that end, we have been directly engaged with clients, merchants, policymakers and other interested parties that share our desire for a healthy, competitive and viable debit segment in the U.S.  On March 13, prior to the April 1 implementation date, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division issued a civil investigative demand requesting additional information about PIN-authenticated Visa Debit and elements of our new debit strategies, including the fixed acquirer fee. In March, we met with the department twice and provided materials in response to the CID. We are confident our actions are appropriate and that our response to the DOJ supports that.  But in a business as complex as ours, the department's request is not unexpected. Visa has received 4 other requests for information from the department since 2007, each of which took from 9 to almost 24 months to complete. All have been resolved with our full cooperation. We are continuing to provide materials and cooperate with the department. I will keep you updated if and when the situation warrants.  So I will end my debit-related comments where I start. The impact of the regulation in the U.S. has been significant but almost exactly as we planned for. I am confident we fully scoped the impact of the regulation. Our updated guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012, as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013, take everything I've discussed into account.  Bottom line, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the U.S. and positioning Visa to grow from here. And as I have said, throughout this process, we are fully engaged with our clients, we are focused on their needs and we are moving forward.  Turning our attention outside the United States. We are steadily expanding Visa's international business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international geographies by 2015. In fact, our international geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, driving approximately 64% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter and now represent 47% of Visa's net revenue.  Our Latin American region has experienced 9 consecutive quarters with payment volume growth on a constant dollar basis exceeding 20%. In fact, the March quarter delivered a solid 25% growth rate. We are seeing particularly good success in Brazil where we have reached an agreement with a large Brazilian bank that has traditionally maintained the majority of its business with one of our largest competitors.  With this new agreement, we estimate that 50% of that client's card portfolio will be Visa branded in the next few years.  We also recently reached an agreement with all of our major clients in Brazil that will dramatically increase the number of transactions over VisaNet. Today, about 63% of Visa's transaction in Brazil get routed over VisaNet. With this agreement, over 90% of our Brazilian transactions will route over VisaNet starting in the next few quarters.  This important agreement directly advances one of our strategic goals: ensuring that a greater share of our transactions are processed on VisaNet. Simply put, carrying our own transactions on VisaNet delivers greater revenue to Visa. And, just as importantly, it allows Visa to deliver the overall benefits of the network and of our services, including better fraud detection and improved transaction quality to cardholders, merchants and our bank customers.  At the same time, our Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions delivered a strong combined 16% payment volume growth for the 2 regions during the March quarter. This performance was driven by continued execution of our locally tailored growth strategies, which includes increasing penetration and usage of debit and premium credit products, expansion of our acceptance footprint and driving cross-border transactions. And to build on that, we signed several additional deals that will drive future growth in these rapidly expanding regions.  On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. Our innovation investments and acquisitions in CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo are paying off and are allowing us to execute on our vision to introduce the next generation of commerce and electronic payments.  This past quarter, we reached agreements with some of the world's largest mobile network operators and mobile device manufacturers to extend Visa's payment functionality to mobile subscribers. Vodafone, the second largest mobile operator in the world, plans to develop a virtual wallet with a Visa mobile prepaid account preloaded. The wallet will be offered to 390 million of Vodafone mobile subscribers in more than 30 countries. This agreement is the largest of its kind between a mobile operator and a global payments network.  Orange telecom has agreed to offer their customers in 7 geographies across Africa and the Middle East a Visa prepaid account linked to their mobile phone number.  At the same time, we continue to lead the way for broad adoption of Near Field Communication technology. Our previously announced agreements to license payWave technology to Google Wallet and Isis are 2 prominent examples, and we are actively engaged with handset manufacturers as they begin to deliver NFC-enabled devices to the marketplace.  Examples of our progress from the most recent quarter include an agreement with Intel Corporation, which announced plans to make Visa payWave the standard payment application for Intel's soon-to-be launched mobile handset devices. Additionally, Nokia's new Lumia smartphone was tested in our labs and recently certified for use with Visa payWave.  To further support issuers who want to advance NFC programs, we executed a deal with Oberthur Technologies to roll out Visa's mobile provisioning service, which provides issuers with a secure way to manage and provision credentials on any mobile device.  It's been 2 years since we made the decision to acquire CyberSource, and I'm pleased to say that quarter after quarter, CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions totaled $1.3 billion, growing 26% versus the same period a year ago.  At the time of the acquisition, we saw opportunity to further accelerate CyberSource growth by investing in that business and by co-selling Visa processing services and CyberSource merchant, gateway and fraud services.  For example, in AP and CEMEA, we have successfully sold integrated solutions to major financial institutions, including Gateway Services and direct connect to VisaNet. Meanwhile, in Latin America, Cielo, which is one of the largest acquirer of processors in Brazil with approximately 70% of e-commerce volume in that country, announced its partnership with CyberSource to provide fraud management solutions to Brazilian e-commerce merchants.  These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of Visa and CyberSource together, and we will continue to invest in this business to drive future growth. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business as e-commerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally.  Perhaps one of the best examples to date of how Visa's acquisition assets are helping us introduce a new payment service is an agreement signed last week with Nexus, the largest telecommunications company in Malaysia. By combining Fundamo and CyberSource capabilities, we are providing Nexus with an integrated payment solution for use in set-top boxes that will enable consumers to purchase digital goods. Together, Fundamo and CyberSource fill the commerce need for a simple account checkout and authorization process.  I'll close with perhaps the most comprehensive example of how we are a leader in the next generation of commerce, V.me. As a reminder, V.me is our next-generation digital wallet service and global acceptance mark, and another example of how we are applying our technology and expertise to deliver solutions that will benefit financial institutions, merchants and consumers.  A year ago, I shared our vision for a service that would meet the evolving ways and places people are transacting by enabling customers to use one way to pay regardless of where they are or what device they use, while also delivering value-added services beyond payments like personalized offers and alerts. It was a big idea but one I knew we could deliver on.  Today, I'm pleased to share that V.me is becoming a reality. The closed employee beta program I highlighted during last quarter's earnings call exceeded our expectations, and we are now applying those learnings as we open up V.me in public beta tests with selected merchants.  This week, we are going live in beta with our first e-commerce merchant, reQ10sbuy.com [ph]. This is the first in a series of e-commerce merchants we expect to go live with between now and peak season. Our immediate priority is to drive toward consumer adoption, which will require engagement with both merchants and financial institutions. Bringing these groups together for a common purpose is a long-standing, core competency for Visa, and we are already making good progress.  On the issuer side, we know our clients are working to deliver products and services that meet the needs and expectations of their increasingly digital customers, and we need to demonstrate that Visa is offering the best solution. As of now, we already have several large and midsized clients poised to offer V.me and are engaged in productive conversations with several additional clients.  In parallel, we need to bring additional merchants onboard. To that end, our merchant sales teams across Visa, CyberSource and PlaySpan are moving quickly to build the V.me footprint. I anticipate that by the holiday shopping season, we will have enough merchants onboard to hold a full consumer launch in the U.S. It's an ambitious agenda, and flawless execution will be critical. I have every reason to believe we will be successful.  And so to sum up, the examples I've highlighted today demonstrate that Visa is building off of our strong foundation, adapting to change and moving ahead. While the environment we operate in is both highly competitive and dynamic, we remain unwavering in our commitment to our clients, expansion of our core business, ongoing innovation and our guidance.  Overall, I'm confident that Visa will be a strong, globally oriented growth company as we move ahead.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron.\nByron H. Pollitt: Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs.  First. Note that we recorded the quarter on an adjusted basis, having eliminated the positive effect to earnings from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities due to the change in state tax rate. This remeasurement accounted for an incremental $0.31 to GAAP EPS. We also saw a benefit in the quarter from the catch-up effect of the lower, ongoing state tax rate that accounted for another $0.05.  Turning to our actual year-to-date results. The adjusted tax rate now reflects a run rate consistent with our full year guidance.  Second. Visa's 15% net revenue growth in the second quarter was once again broad based and encouraging with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and an even more impressive 21% growth rate in Rest of World.  Third. U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth. Most recently, through the 28th of April, credit payment volume growth has comped at a very healthy 11% rate, consistent with continued U.S. economic recovery.  Fourth. As expected and fully contemplated in our 2012 guidance, aggregate U.S. debit growth, though modestly positive for the March quarter, will turn negative in the June and September quarters. The impact of regulatory changes, primarily on Interlink volumes, picked up momentum during the March quarter and accelerated in April. As Joe mentioned at the outset, these trends will need to annualize before we see a resumption of positive growth in this U.S. product category.  Fifth. Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 16%, below our full year guidance but in line with our expectations for the first half of the fiscal year. We expect higher incentive levels in the second half of the year as U.S. debit-related merchant and acquirer incentive agreements take hold.  Finally, sixth. As Joe mentioned at the outset, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal year 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. To be more specific about what this means for 2013, we expect to see improving debit payment volume trajectory over the 4 quarters and revenue growth to accelerate off of 2012 levels. As for EPS, given this trajectory and the effect of lapping the regulatory impact, we anticipate, at this point in time, growth in the high teens.  Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the March quarter, followed by our results through April 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012.  Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 11%, unchanged from the December quarter's 11%.  Several call-outs. First, credit in both U.S. and Rest of World picked up 2 points of growth versus Q1; second, Rest of World debit picked up 4 points of growth over Q1; third, these upticks balanced out the drop in U.S. debit growth from 6% in Q1 to 2% in Q2, thereby maintaining our overall quarter growth of 11%.  More recently, through April 28, which also represents the first 28 days of compliance with the April 1 deadline for 2 unaffiliated networks, U.S. payment volume growth sits at minus 2%, comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 12% for debit. While still early days, these results are tracking slightly above our beginning-of-year projections.  Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 60% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter with the U.S. growing 13% and the Rest of World, 17%. We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and CEMEA regions, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears solid.  Through April 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15% with a U.S. growth rate of 11% and Rest of World of 17%.  Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period, in line with the 8% growth in the December quarter. For the month of April through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a negative 1%.  Four call-outs. First. Visa-processed transactions are continuing to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and all of Rest of World.  Second. As expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is impacting our Interlink product, where transaction growth turned negative beginning in January.  Third. Given the April 1 compliance deadline requiring 2 independent networks, we expect the negative impact on transaction growth to accelerate and reach a high point in fiscal Q3 followed by an improving trajectory in fiscal Q4 of this year.  Finally, fourth. As a reminder, transactions lost on Interlink primarily impact the data processing fee line as this type of transaction does not earn service fees. The impacts to date on Interlink have tracked closely to our beginning-of-year projections for transactions, revenue and earnings.  Now. Turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was neutral.  Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the March quarter.  Data processing revenue was $922 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions.  International transaction revenue was up 17% to $733 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes with mid-teen growth rates in both the U.S. and Rest of World.  As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance. Looking at the back half of the year, our expectation is for a step-up, consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. Ultimately, the final number will be determined in large part by the success of our incentive strategies with merchants and acquirers.  Total operating expenses for the quarter were $972 million, up 13% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our acquisitions and technology projects to support our growth strategies.  Marketing expenses at $170 million reflect a heavier weighting to the second half of the year, timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics.  Our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. As was the case last quarter, this is largely due to the expense timing as we expect a second half ramp-up in incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics.  Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter. Given an expected ramp-up over the back half of the year, we remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year.  Our adjusted tax rate for Q2 was just under 33% after removing the effect of the deferred tax liability remeasurement. Our expectation for a full year adjusted rate in the 33% to 34% range remains unchanged.  Coming off the heels of a very active fiscal first quarter, we were not buyers of our stock during the second quarter. As has been our practice, we remain conservative and patient in our approach, taking advantage of short-term market disruptions to obtain more attractive pricing.  At the end of the March quarter, we had 673 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 676 million.  Finally, we are raising our 2012 fiscal EPS guidance to the high teens to low 20s range as a result of better-than-anticipated, year-to-date financial performance, forward visibility into service fee revenues given the quarter lag on their recognition, strong cross-border trends and early traction on our U.S. debit strategies.  And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.\nJason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And I really appreciate all the color on the DOJ situation. I think that was very helpful. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the new FANF fee structure, which I understand just went into effect about a month ago. But what's been the reaction from the merchant community now that we're actually in implementation, finally? And do you anticipate any roadblocks with the implementation there, putting the DOJ situation aside?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well, this is Joe Saunders. We implemented that on April 1, so there hasn't been any reaction because I don't believe the fee has been billed to anyone yet. Although [ph], there hasn't been a lot of reaction to it. It is part of our -- the total structure we've put to deal with the Durbin regulation. We are not making money per se off of that fee. The combination of discounts and incentives that we have put together, I think, actually relate in a modest loss in the amount of $100 million a year. So we aren't doing this with the intent of raising prices. I don't think that -- well, I don't -- I know that we haven't had any difficulties in getting the structure going, so I think we'll have to wait and see how everything works out.\nOperator: Next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a follow-up to that, on the CID. Does it in any way change your desire to utilize the, I guess, you call it FASB [ph]? Or is it business as usual there with that product? And also, just the service fee yield. Byron, it was up quite a bit more than what we had modeled. Was there a price change there or a reclass? Or maybe just a mix change? Any help there would be great.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Why don't you go ahead?\nByron H. Pollitt: Yes, yes. Let me start with the second one, Tien-Tsin. So there has been a mix change. If you look at the payment volume growth, nominally it's 11%. And our service fee growth was 13%. So if I look at it that way, roughly 1% of the -- or roughly half of the increase has been a boost in yield because of the lower mix of Interlink transactions, as I think you were referring to, and the -- our hedging actually produced another percentage point of gain and the rest, I would say, is noise.\nJoseph W. Saunders: As it relates to the strategies that we've implemented, we just implemented them. I don't have any desire to change what we've done. But we put these in place in anticipation of an environment, and we'll look at them and we'll monitor them and we'll change them if it's appropriate to change them. Otherwise, we'll continue down the path. I think that it would be safe to say that we were more successful in dealing with the -- our relationships going forward and we could have projected in the past. So we'll just have to look at everything and take it all into consideration and we'll do what's appropriate. Once again, though, I mean, I feel that the guidance projections that we've made for 2012 and 2013 are safe to support in almost any environment of things that might or might not happen.\nOperator: The next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.\nGlenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just so I have the pattern right, so we have -- PIN went negative in January, the PIN growth trajectory. Furthermore, we're a further step down after April 1. You have incentives increasing in the second half. But then you talk about the drag on the PIN growth is supposed to ease by September. So it hasn't anniversaried yet because we haven\u2019t reached next January or next April. So is the logic behind that, just so I have it right, because you're expecting these incentives you're going to pay out to sort of get that volume back to you? Do I have that right?\nByron H. Pollitt: You have everything right except the PIN piece. The -- you're right, the -- it's going to take 4 quarters to annualize. So when we referred to a positive trajectory, what we meant by that was the impact of payment volume on lag year-over-year will have its greatest impact in Q3. We would then expect continued negative comparisons through -- until we annualized but at an increasingly less negative rate as we progress through the 4 quarters. That would also be true for debit-related transactions. So PV and transactions.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Let me just follow up on that and make perfectly clear one thing. And that is that we are never going to regain all of the market share that we had in the debit card business. Nothing that we say or none of our strategies suggest that, that will happen or could happen or -- and nothing that we've done or thought about or said anticipates that it will happen. The environment has changed by regulation. We're operating in a different world, and we're going to live forever with less share than we once had.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I guess I had a -- you answered my question on just the market share but maybe on share buyback. I mean, I guess you guys didn't buy back stock because you felt the stock was somewhat fairly valued. But, I mean, did -- should we assume that if the shares stay at these levels, you wouldn't buy back any more throughout the remainder of the year?\nByron H. Pollitt: No, you shouldn't. We are a committed management team to returning excess cash to shareholders. I think if you take a -- and so -- and we remain committed to that. If you would take a step back, we had a very large, in our view, very large share repurchase in the first quarter. And so we time our purchases over the course of the year, looking for both opportunities to do that at attractive pricing but also, in the case of the first quarter, being responsive to an opportunity to put a significant increment of cash into the escrow account. So I think if you take a step back year-to-date, we're all -- we've already made sizable repurchases, and you can count on us to continue to return excess cash not just for this year but years to come.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Williams with UBS.\nJohn T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just a couple of quick ones. On the marketing budget, just as we think forward into the rest of the year, regarding calendarization related to the Olympics, and any other things we might need to think about and -- as we look at the marketing line?\nByron H. Pollitt: I'm not sure what else to add other than every 4 years, we have a particularly attractive opportunity to put significant media into 2 quarters, which is the third and the fourth. And knowing that, that was the feature of what we want to emphasize this year, we kept -- we phased our marketing in the first 2 quarters in order to accommodate that. We will reset marketing from a bottoms up standpoint beginning next year and, in October, give you a sense of what that will look like.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just Joe, I mean, just trying to clarify a comment. You said, on '12, '13 guidance, you thought it was safe under very -- under various circumstances. Are you suggesting that if you needed to adjust your strategy based upon the CID, that you still felt confident in your -- in the guidance? Is that -- am I reading that right or not?\nJoseph W. Saunders: That -- the Department of Justice is certainly included in what I said, but it will include a lot more than that. But yes, absolutely certain.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And, I mean, the CID, I mean, is mostly focused on -- I mean, I guess would you -- would you view it focused mostly on the 2% of revenue of that strategy, on that 2% piece of the revenue or more broadly?\nJoseph W. Saunders: I mean, I don't know how to get into that specifically. You\u2019re asked general questions about what you're doing to react to the legislation, and it's the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. So obviously, they must have a concern that we were doing things that might undermine that and -- but I don't really want to go any further. I mean, I'm not them, and I can't say that. We have talked to them. We provide information to them. And we have obviously very seriously considered various things that may or may not happen, and we've taken it into consideration and in our guidance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen.\nMoshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: You've had really impressive growth on the credit side, especially the acceleration we've seen from last quarter. Byron, maybe you can talk a bit more about the various moving parts in terms of the major drivers here? Can we talk about the consumer side versus the corporate side?\nByron H. Pollitt: Yes, our business is still largely driven by the consumer side for sure. The commercial side is growing at good rates. We are very encouraged by the numbers being posted on the commercial side because we think, first and foremost, that's a healthy barometer with regards to how businesses are doing and the continuity in the kind of payment volume growth we're seeing, particularly in credit. And if you take a look at the cross border, which is probably our most important leading indicator, the cross-border trends in both consumer retail as well as commercial are very strong. And so within -- and that is one of the indicators we look to when we put out our guidance, and one of the inputs that gave us confidence to raise our guidance for the year.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Yes. On the consumer side, I mentioned in my comments the extension of our partnerships with a number of financial institutions that represent a significant portion of our volume. I mentioned the United-Continental arrangement, which is going to deliver new volume to us. I mentioned signing other financial institutions that we have done less business with in the past. I mentioned Alaska Airlines. And so the trajectory of what we're doing, we're very happy with, and we're very bullish about it. We're very pleased that this is happening at this opportune time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: I hate to go back to the whole debit thing. But I guess I'm trying to understand how -- the market share loss is that extreme in the short run? I know the revenue impact isn't that large. But even in terms of just the transactions, if your -- if the process allows the merchant to route the transaction over the Signature network -- or has not yet been put in place? In other words, was that -- because otherwise, how is that market share loss that significant if that was already in place?\nJoseph W. Saunders: The \u2013- [indiscernible] you suggest wasn't started until April 14 and isn't fully implemented and won't be for several weeks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I guess I expected a decline in Interlink volume. But specifically, what's happened in Visa Debit volume that you expect in 3Q and 4Q? And I guess inside of that, how much of that is market share loss versus just banks maybe deemphasizing signature debit?\nJoseph W. Saunders: It's hard to be a totally specific about it. I think that, that has leveled off, and we continue to look at modest growth. But right now, I would attribute the majority of it to the removal of all the rewards programs. I mean, there virtually are no rewards programs associated with debit cards anymore. And those programs did drive volume. And a de-emphasis in marketing these programs by the financial institutions. It's a combination of those 2 things that had an effect on it. There were some small pockets of cards that were put out that never had a PIN capability, and the regulation requires that, that change. And so people that simply couldn't use the PIN numbers, can now. Yes, it -- a combination of those 3 things, in our opinion, at this point in time is pretty much what's going on in the Signature business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.\nAndrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just to make sure I have this clear in my earnings addled mind, Byron, when you talk about total transaction volume in the back half of fiscal '12 in aggregate across the business, you're thinking about transaction volume being down, correct? And does that mix -- does the shift in mix away from Interlink change kind of what we should think about as the data processing yield as a consequence?\nByron H. Pollitt: Yes, it -- so my commentary on transactions was for debit, specifically, in aggregate. The -- what I think what will become increasingly important as we look at processed transactions is U.S. credit. And then, separately, what are we doing in the Rest of the World. And I think we indicated that we have very, very vibrant transaction growth rates in U.S. credit as -- and in Rest of World. And with regards to yield, we'll give this -- there is definitely going to be some disconnects in the way that you're -- that you look at this from a modeling standpoint because the -- I think one of the -- you heard this earlier. One of the natural effects of pulling out Interlink transactions is -- since it only affects the DP line, there will be a natural drop just because it will be generating last DP fees. But it's also removing payment volume for which there are no service fees. So that will actually boost the service fee yield on the transactions that remain. And we will give some thought as to how to talk about that with you all by the next earnings call to help sort that out. And if that weren't enough, we're going to take the -- I think we've already mentioned we're going to take the fixed acquiring network fee. And we're -- for the most part, that will appear in data processing as a line item. So we have some work to do to make this more transparent with regards to what will happen to those lines, what we think will happen to those lines. And we'll plan that for next quarter's earnings call.\nJoseph W. Saunders: And as -- just as a reminder, the transaction loss in Interlink is coming from a business that a year ago generated 2.8% of our global revenue and last quarter generated 2% of our global revenue. It gives you an idea of the notion that there are different yields upon different types of payment volume.\nOperator: The next question comes from Len DeProspo with Janney.\nLeonard A. DeProspo - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: This is a question with regard to sort of the advertising promotion expense. I think the Olympics are going to happen entirely in your fourth quarter, but I assume you all will be doing some spending out of that. So could you just help us break out how much of that incremental spending will occur in the third quarter versus fourth quarter, maybe just percentage split?\nByron H. Pollitt: Yes, we don't typically provide that. But you are absolutely right. There is a considerable amount of promotional activity done with our banking partners, which has actually -- some of which actually started in our second fiscal quarter. It really ramps during the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter, you have the last of the broadcast media that is fairly intensive around the Olympics themselves. So to be helpful here, we are holding -- we've said we are holding to our existing marketing guidance so that you have an order of magnitude and you now have 2 quarters in the can. And in terms of what our full year results are likely to be, I think we've bounded that pretty well. And between the quarters, we just -- as I said, we typically just don't break that out.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Yes. You should also think about the fact that the advertising we do in the third and the fourth quarter supports the programs that many of our financial institutions initiate around the Olympics with Olympic theme cards, and that those initiatives generate more particularly credit card volume, which is the reason that we do this. We have, I think, almost -- on a global basis almost 3x as many financial institutions participating in promotions this year as we did 4 years ago.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.\nJulio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Guys, just to go back to the 2013 commentary, Byron, can you just walk us back through both the revenue expectations and the EPS expectations? I want to make sure we have the -- both of those numbers there correct.\nByron H. Pollitt: So on the revenue, what we said was our expectation is that revenue in '13 will grow off of 2012 levels. So whatever the growth rate in revenue is for 2012, everything else being equal, we would expect it to be somewhat higher in 2013. With regards to EPS growth, if you recall, back in the October earnings call when we reaffirmed the '13 guidance, what we said was we expected EPS to also grow off of 2000 levels, but our expectation at that point, and our guidance at that time on 2012, was that EPS would grow mid to high teens. We are now at high teens, low 20s. And as we indicated in the earnings call back in October, there were a number of components that got us to that EPS growth, one of which was a favorable step-down in our ongoing tax rate. And that represented plus or minus 5 percentage points of EPS growth. And so as we began to, in effect, outperform during the course of the year and raise our guidance, we wanted to make it clear that when we talked about 2013, our expectation was more high teens, recognizing that it wouldn't be likely or possible for us to lap that same kind of tax improvement on EPS, and that way, we'd be substituting instead operating earnings for that tax benefit that we received in '12 that wouldn't expect to duplicate in '13. And so that's why we want to make very clear that, at least at this point in time, our earnings growth guidance should be in the high teens range.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.\nTimothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I wondered if I could just ask a question around the commentary around processing transactions in Brazil. Curious to what extent this has some impact on the conversation around revenue yield, if it's something we would notice if that ramps up over the next couple of quarters. And in conjunction with that, is there further opportunity with bank partners or other services around this agreement to continue to improve that yield if that relationship would mature further in years?\nJoseph W. Saunders: The increase in processing on VisaNet in Brazil has a -- does have an effect on our yield because we're going to be receiving revenues for transactions going over VisaNet that we didn't before. It's going to ramp up over a period of time. I don't think that we're in position right now to tell you how that's going to affect our global yields or our global -- or even our global revenues in the short run. We're very excited about it because it puts us in a position in Brazil similar to the United States where not only are we going to be processing more transactions but we will be able to deliver other revenue generating services. And I think that you'll begin to see that manifest itself in our 2013 projection.\nOperator: The last question does come from Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: One clarification, Byron, in response to an earlier question, I think, on the service fee yield, the service fee as a percentage of volume. You had said it's a \u2013- it\u2019s a mix -- or about half of it is a mix issue and the other half is hedging. Just so I understand right, service fees are not earned on Interlink. So the mix we're seeing there is the -- dividing by a lower denominator? Is that what's causing the mix -- the issue -- that yield to go up? And then my unrelated question would be on V.me, do you expect to have anything in your marketing budget or any significant amount on your budgeting for that fourth quarter Christmas holiday launch? I mean, is this going to be a pretty significant launch this year? Or is it going to be more of a soft launch?\nJoseph W. Saunders: You go ahead.\nByron H. Pollitt: Yes, let me take the first one. Yes, you have it right. What we have -- when you remove the Interlink transactions, you're removing transactions from the denominator, but you're not touching the service fees. So the yield automatically starts moving up.\nJoseph W. Saunders: As it relates to V.me, we will have -- certainly have some advertising in that. But the advertising that we will do will be in conjunction with merchants that are coming on to the network and through financial institutions to encourage their customers to enroll. So I guess in that regard, it would be soft here, and, I guess, you mean [ph] national TV advertising in the fourth quarter.\nJack Carsky: And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining us. And if anybody has follow-up questions, feel free to give Investor Relations a call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. The call has concluded.

And as always, thank you for joining us. I plan to walk you through 3 key areas during today's call. First, I'll provide a brief update on Visa's financial performance and outlook, including some perspective on key environmental and event-specific factors that could impact our business over the balance of fiscal 2012. Following that, I'll walk through our progress of growing Visa's core business both in the United States and internationally, including an update on U.S. debit. And finally, I'll discuss Visa's investments and innovation, which can help us expand our core business and generate new revenue streams. Visa's global enterprise outpaced our own expectations during the first quarter, an encouraging opening to our fiscal year. Net operating revenues were $2.5 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by robust growth in our international businesses, continued resilience in U.S. credit, sustained cross border spending and strong e-commerce growth. Net income for the quarter was $1 billion, a 16% increase over last year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.49 or a 21% increase over the first quarter of 2011. Overall, our first quarter performance clearly demonstrates the strength and resilience of Visa's global model and our ability to grow even in a challenging global economy. While we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2012, it is clear we must carefully navigate a complex and uncertain business environment.  We see signs of modest global GP -- GDP expansion for the rest of our fiscal year, with emerging markets continuing to grow at rates faster than the global average. That being said, we are closely watching the economic conditions that could impact our business, including continued volatility in Europe. Additionally, we are still working through the implementation of debit regulation in the United States. I will provide details shortly. But it's fair to say, the dust is still settling. Overall, Visa is successfully executing its plan, and I continue to be encouraged that the net impact is consistent with our guidance outlook.  Taking these macro and issue-specific factors into account, as well as our better-than-expected first quarter, we are raising our FY '12 revenue guidance to low double-digit growth from high single to low double-digit growth and our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance from mid to high teens to just high teens. As I stated last quarter, we are reaffirming our belief that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to the U.S. debit regulation, and growth in 2013 will accelerate off of 2012 levels. And based on that outlook, we continue to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. We used $1.6 billion of our operating cash to reduce the as-converted Class A common stock by 16.2 million shares during the 3 months ended December 31, 2011. Of the $1.6 billion, $75 million was used to repurchase Class A common stock in the open market, while we deposited $1.57 billion of our operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. Looking ahead, our board has authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization.  Before moving on to our business update, I'd like to briefly address the merchant litigation in the United States. Although I'm constrained to discuss the details due to the confidential mediation process, I can tell you that I believe that with the court's assistance, progress is being made towards resolution of all issues. After our latest escrow deposit in December, we now have an uncommitted balance of $4.3 billion in our litigation escrow account, which is consistent with our view of the current status of mediation discussion. Visa is unwilling to agree to any significant or long-term credit interchange rate reductions or any settlement agreement that doesn't provide a full resolution to that and other key issues. Although progress is being made, there are uncertainties, which continue to exist. And accordingly, in our judgment at this time, the company believes that the loss is not probable and estimable under GAAP.  Now let's turn to the business update. During the first quarter, Visa continued to accelerate the migration to digital currency by successfully executing our growth strategy of expanding our core credit, debit, prepaid and commercial businesses, expanding acceptance, extending our international reach and aggressively investing in innovative next-generation payment technology. Worldwide, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes grew 12% and 9%, respectively, on a constant dollar basis this past quarter.  In the United States, volumes on all Visa products grew 7% during the quarter. In regard to our U.S. debit business, I feel very good about where we are and the progress we've made adapting our business to the new debit regulation. We are making the best of an obviously negative event. That being said, I'd like to share some important observations. Historically, we have always been a clear leader in the U.S. debit market and thus, are the primary participant with downside risk. As we have acknowledged previously, regulation will reduce Visa's U.S. debit volumes. The new legal requirements are changing competitive dynamics and requiring all issuers to place competitive marks on their cards in order to comply with the law. While the law doesn't require compliance until April, some issuers have already begun to make a change.  The deceleration of our U.S. debit volume growth during the first quarter was early sign of this impact, driven by slower growth in PIN transactions and an expected deemphasis by issuers of debit card marketing and debit rewards programs.  A key driver of this slower growth was one major financial institution's decision to remove Interlink from the back of their cards, which began in the fall as part of their own plan to comply with the regulation. They and Visa will be able to compete for PIN transactions with the PIN authentication available on Visa check cards. While we are taking these impacts seriously, let me also be clear about a few additional facts that give me confidence about our long-term growth as we advance our debit strategy in the new environment. To begin with, we are making steady progress advancing our strategies with issuance and merchant routing. We are aggressively pursuing a backup card strategy that adds Interlink to many existing cards that currently carry competitive brands. In fact, we're poised to sign new agreements with major financial institutions to secure backup card placement. We look forward to updating you on our progress securing these decisions in the coming quarter. At the same time, we remain on track to maintain our front of card issuance relationships, and in fact have extended the majority of those major relationships to 2015 and beyond. Signature transactions generate a far larger share of our U.S. debit revenue and offer greater revenue yields. This is particularly important as we see no sign of a wholesale shift to PIN debit by the merchant community and our signature debit volumes were resilient during the first quarter. On a parallel track, we are moving forward with strategies to compete for merchant routing decision. One key aspect of that plan is Visa's previously announced program for modified acceptance economics in the United States, which we believe will offer merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction's cost. As a next step in our implementation plan, we will share specifics with acquirers and merchants later in the month.  Our updated 2012 guidance takes all of these factors into account, including some loss of debit share and I'm confident that we have appropriately scoped the impact of Durbin.  As stated earlier in my remarks, we expect that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to U.S. debit regulation and we still expect growth in 2013 to accelerate off of the 2012 levels.  Bottom line, I'm confident we are moving in the right direction. We have a smart debit strategy and we are executing it successfully. Now let's focus on credit products in the United States, which performed very well during the quarter. Payment volumes increased by 10%, the eighth consecutive quarter of positive growth and third consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category. Additionally, affluent credit in the United States post a particularly strong payment volume growth, increasing more than twice as fast as the overall category during the 2 most recent quarters. A key differentiator and important contributor to our success is our unsurpassed portfolio of co-brand products, which are also outperforming the category and clearly driving consumer loyalty and gaining further traction in the market. We also grew our portfolio by building on existing long-term relationships and winning several important new U.S. credit mandates during the quarter, and are excited for those to appear in the market in the near term. Prepaid also continues to be another area of strength, posting robust volume growth during the first quarter. We signed a number of agreements that will drive future growth, including multiple mandates in 2 of the fastest-growing segments in the prepaid category, general purpose, reloadable cards and employee benefit programs.  For example, we extended our relationship with Green Dot, the largest program manager in prepaid. In addition, our government prepaid programs continue to thrive. The Washington D.C. Department of Employment Services recently announced that all new recipients of unemployment insurance benefits will have the option to receive automatic payments on Visa prepaid cards. In addition, we recently added Connecticut, South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana to the list of states offering programs to distribute state income tax refunds on Visa prepaid cards.  Overall, approximately 40 states are using or are in the process of implementing Visa prepaid card programs to disperse a range of benefits through more than 80 programs. In fact, approximately 30 of 38 state unemployment insurance card programs and 31 of 49 state child support programs can be delivered off Visa cards today. Building on that, we are rapidly expanding our government activities to key geographies worldwide. Now let's turn to Visa's International business, which continues to be an increasingly important growth driver for our organization. International geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis and drove approximately 66% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter, and now, represent 46% of Visa's net revenue. This means we continue to make steady progress towards our stated goal of deriving 50% of Visa's revenues from International businesses by 2015. Yet again, our performance in Latin America stands out with continued strong growth. Payment volumes grew by 22% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, and we are building on that momentum by winning several important client mandates.  In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bancomer to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country. Turning to CEMEA. We were pleased to win a major long-term mandate with Al Rajhi Bank, covering around 50% of all payments volume in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The agreement, the largest we've ever signed in the Middle East, is exclusive for debit and prepaid and covers the vast majority of that institution's credit product. We're also continuing to invest in the long-term growth of Africa. Without question, Visa's existing product offerings and our unrivaled network provide us with a strong foundation to push our financial inclusion agenda forward. Additionally, Fundamo and our partnership with Monitise, provide us with a footprint and technical expertise in emerging economies. I firmly believe no organization is better positioned than Visa to lead forward the migration to digital currency on the African continent.  An example of our progress was our November launch of a prepaid account that can be accessed through a mobile phone, offering consumers in developing countries a secure, reliable, globally inter-operable electronic payment account. MTN group, a leading telecommunications provider in Africa and the Middle East, plans to offer the new Visa product to MTN MobileMoney customers across its markets. As part of the launch, the new product will first be available to customers in Nigeria and Uganda.  Additionally, Fundamo is supporting our unique partnership with the Rwandan government to drive access to financial services for our consumers in that country. And in Asia Pacific, we continue to build steady momentum in our prepaid business with 2 prominent examples coming from Australia during the quarter. With Australia Post, we executed a multiyear exclusive agreement for their general-purpose, reloadable and travel products. We also want to mandate with ANZ, where a multicurrency travel program allowing consumers to load up to 10 different currencies on a single card and lock in exchange rates, giving a cardholder even greater control over their travel budget. Importantly, Visa processing services was a critical part of our agreement with ANZ helping advance Visa's overall strategy of expanding processing penetration worldwide. Lastly, let's talk about Visa's innovation agenda. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business products, add incremental value to the merchant community and create new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our clients. In the United States, Visa is focused on offering consumers a seamless and secure payment experience, whether they're paying at a point-of-sale, with a card or phone or buying digital or physical goods online. The key to that approach is V.me, our newly branded wallet service in global acceptance mark, which is a top priority for the organization. And we are moving swiftly towards broad commercial availability in 2012.  As I said previously, our top priority with V.me is to advance our Click-to-buy and Touch-to-buy functionalities, including aliasing capability. This functionality will immediately increase ease-of-use and convenience for consumers while offering merchants and financial institutions the greatest business value. Longer term, V.me will offer our clients a range of payment-related capabilities that can be tailored to meet each organization's specific needs. So where are we? During the quarter, we took an important step towards consumer availability, initiating a beta version of V.me with close to 1,000 Visa employees and certain key partners. In the coming weeks, we will be expanding the beta group and start the implementation with a few brand-name merchants. Of course, scaling V.me will require buy-in from the broad merchant acquirer and issuer community.  To that end, we are directly engaged with more than 100 major merchants to discuss and test the product. We are also integrating V.me with our CyberSource gateway, which will quickly enable access for 380,000 online merchants. In addition, we will extend this capability through our other acquirers and reseller partners. At the same time, we are engaged in productive conversations with several major issuers, who are showing genuine enthusiasm for the product as an offering for their clients. I look forward to providing updates in the coming quarters. We are also making platform enhancements that pave the way for broad adoption of the payment-related services on mobile devices in the near term. Today, we announced that hundreds of financial institutions using a combination of Visa issuer processing platform, Visa DPS, and monetize global applications, can immediately offer a range of payment-related mobile services to their account holders. These can be accessed via almost any mobile device and operating system. This effectively makes our DPS platform a one-stop shop for mobile services within the issuing community. Immediately available services, include monitoring account balances, transferring funds between accounts and instant alerts on mobile devices. And we have plans to deploy additional offerings, including mobile check deposit, NFC payments, mobile offers and support for V.me. We are also investing in mobile money solutions outside the United States. Here, Fundamo is a key to our efforts as they are a global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing markets worldwide. During the quarter, Fundamo secured deals with mobile operators and banks in several geographies around the globe, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan. On the e-commerce front, Visa is clearly benefiting from an increasingly strong secular trend towards online shopping, and our acquisition of CyberSource have placed them, favorably positioned Visa to accelerate that growth. In fact, CyberSource's billable transactions totaled 1.2 billion, a very strong 25% growth rate over the same period a year ago. We secured a number of new business wins with major partners in the United States, including American Apparel, AutoTrader.com and ShutterPlay. Outside the U.S., CyberSource continues to gain traction. For example, in China we've expanded our relationship with 99Bill, one of that country's leading electronic-payment service providers, a prime example of how Visa is partnering with leading local providers to deliver value to the payments ecosystem in that country. 99Bill has just gone live with CyberSource's broad management solution, CyberSource Decision Manager, and is using CyberSource services to complement their existing security systems to process cross border transactions safely as they expand business overseas. So to sum up, Visa has continued to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model. Visa continues to grow. We have expanded our core business lines. We have expanded our footprint in international markets both emerging, established. We have increased our investments in innovation to help us carve out new revenue streams for the future. And we have taken important steps in our relationship with the merchant community to help foster greater cooperation in the future.  Each of these achievements helps us continue to deliver against our stated mission of offering more payment choices to more people in more places around the world. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Byron, who will walk you through the financial details of our quarter. And then we could take some of your questions. Byron?\nByron H. Pollitt: Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth in the first quarter was once again broad based and encouraging, with solid 8% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Approximately 66% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States, and non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 46% of Visa's total.  Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 8 consecutive quarters of positive credit unit volume growth. Most recently, the months of November, December and January comped at 12%, 10% and 10%, respectively, which continued the strong growth we have now seen for 2 years. Third, client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 16%, below our full year guidance, as a result of lower-than-anticipated Durbin-related incentive and a lower level of deal activity in the first quarter versus the out quarter. Fourth, note that we are reporting the quarter using a 36% tax rate, above our full year guidance of 33% to 34% on an adjusted basis. We will begin reporting at this lower level once California officially adjusts its tax rate calculation, which we anticipate will be in fiscal Q2.  Finally, fifth, for EPS calculation purposes, the as-converted share count reduction, driven by the escrow deposit took effect on December 29 and therefore, had no noticeable impact on the fiscal Q1 EPS calculation, but will have a full effect for the balance of the year. Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the December quarter followed by our results through the end of January. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012. Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%, modestly below the September quarter's 13%. We saw the following breakdown in the December quarter: in the U.S., payment volume growth was 7%, a modest decrease from the 9% growth we saw in the September quarter. This was comprised of 10% credit growth and 5% debit growth. So we are beginning to see some modest effect on debit from the recently-enacted bed [ph] rules. Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 15%, supported by double-digit growth rates in both debit and credit.  More recently, in the month of January, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 7%. Credit growth was 10%, while debit was 4%. Although not yet available based on the trends we saw during the fourth quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin. Global cross border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, with the U.S. growing 11% and the rest of world 14%.  The recovery of inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa continues, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears to be on track. In January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15%, with uptick in the U.S. growth rate to 13% and rest of world to 17%. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period compared to 9% growth in the September quarter. Here again, we are beginning to see the impact of the new debit rule. For the month of January, processed transaction growth moved back up to 9%.  Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in global payment volumes, better-than-expected data processing revenues and lower-than-anticipated client incentive. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was a positive 1%.  Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $951 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions. On that note, CyberSource posted a 25% gain in transactions over the prior year's quarter, benefiting from Visa's e-commerce transaction growth, which approximated 24% for the quarter. International transaction revenue was up 19% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross border volume, above average currency volatility during the period and modest strategic pricing adjustments outside the United States. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance, but consistent with our full year outlook at 17% to 18%.  Total operating expense for the quarter was $929 million, up 7% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel, network and processing costs associated with investments in our growth strategy. Our operating margin for the quarter was 64%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. This is largely due to expense timing as we expect a ramp-up in investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics.  Capital expenditures were $66 million in the quarter. We expect CapEx to ramp up over the course of the year and remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year.  Finally, as noted earlier, our tax rate for Q1 was 36%. However, we expect the benefits previously discussed from a lower state rate and foreign tax credit to be applied in future quarters' results, retroactive to Q1. Thereby, more accurately reflecting our full year guidance of an adjusted 33% to 34% range. As Joe mentioned, we were active buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing approximately 800,000 shares at an average price of $89.91 in the open market. The escrow funding of $1.57 billion, resulted in a change with the conversion rate of the Class B share, which equates to a reduction in the as-converted Class A common stock of 15.4 million shares effective December 29. At the end of the December quarter, we had 672 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis, which incorporates the impact by the escrow funding and open market purchases. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 690 million for the December quarter. Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan. Finally, we are making 2 changes to our guidance for fiscal 2012. The outlook for net revenue growth is now in the low double-digit range. And for adjusted diluted EPS growth, it is now high teens. All other guidance metrics remain as presented last quarter. As the year unfolds and we have additional clarity around the results of our Durbin debit strategy, as well as U.S. global and global economic momentum, we will be in a better position to refine this guidance as necessary.  And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I had a question on the tax rate beyond the current year. Could we see that fall below your adjusted 33% to 34% range considering the changes that are coming? And secondly, marketing was dramatically below what I was thinking about for the quarter. So I was hoping to get your thoughts there regarding what opportunities did present themselves in the quarter and if your thought process changed for the year.\nByron H. Pollitt: For tax, it's a little early to make that call since we've got this year to play out. But we will, rest assured, we will address tax guidance for the coming year in the next couple of quarters, which is our practice. With regards to marketing, no change. Think of this as timing. Our guidance hasn't changed. We have the Summer Olympics coming up, and we are rephasing our marketing spend to coincide better with the Olympics and the promotions that come in advance. So you should expect to see some movement on the marketing line in fiscal quarters 2 and 3 commensurate with that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.\nDarrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I mean volume trends looked like they've held up pretty well, especially into January. And now we have a guidance change especially on the -- on both the top line and on EPS. Do you think that the guidance is more -- or the change is more reflective of really more benign impacts of maybe the debit regulations as was included in your previous guidance? Or is it more macro-driven? And I guess just the follow-up question to that would be is there more room around the rebates? Maybe -- the 17% to 18% is just conservative on the rebates because maybe the debit environment or the Durbin environment effects were not as bad as expected?\nByron H. Pollitt: So let me take that. This is more a reflection of how some of the risks that Joe and I called out on the last quarter's earnings call, how some of those risks are playing out. Recognizing that we have a one quarter lag on our service fees, that means we've already got a line of sight into 7 months of that revenue. Cross border volumes have held up very well. With regards to both the U.S. and the global economy, both have demonstrated sustained momentum. The exciting drama unfolding in Europe has yet to really play out on the volumes. And so the guidance adjustments are more a function of having a portion of our year with a clear line of sight. And some of the risks we were most concerned about we're getting well into the fiscal year, and they haven't materialized to the degree that -- we had to at least contemplate when we gave the initial guidance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.\nGlenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Joe, thanks for the color on the issuer loss. Was this the ultimate result of a holistic view by the issuer that under no circumstances would they pursue a dual strategy? Or was this a case you wouldn't go as low as they wanted on price? And secondly, could you give us a sense of what portion of your exclusive PIN debit issuers still has to make a decision? What type of win rate have you assumed in your guidance?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well getting back to the particular issuer that we talked about, it was -- I think it's fair to say that it was just a decision about how they were going to comply with the law and knowing to a certain extent that accepting PIN numbers on signature cards as we've always done was an opportunity. I think it was just their way of rationalizing how they wanted to go forward. It weren't a price issue. And then what was the second part of the question? I'm sorry.\nByron H. Pollitt: How many still have to make a decision.\nJoseph W. Saunders: Yes, on removing Interlink, I think most of them have made their decision. There is no other major issuer that has Interlink on the back of the card that's contemplating taking it off. And we have had several wins on putting the Interlink mark on the back of non-Visa debit cards, and that will manifest itself certainly no later than April 1. But I can't really talk about it. We're in the final stages of several contracts, and they don't like us to disclose who they are.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Everything looks really clean here. I just wanted to ask on the client incentives. Byron, you said they were running below the 4-year targets. Should we expect it to spike again around the April 1 exclusivity day? Just trying to get some help with the quarterly spread. And just as a follow-up to that, Joe, you said that the dust hasn't settled. Is it fair to interpret that to mean, how should I say it, that you haven't started playing defense yet with your MPS or the V PIN strategy? Are the issuers, and the acquirers to open the both? Just wanted to get a little bit of color on that.\nJoseph W. Saunders: The second part of the question first. And then Byron can answer the first part of the question. When I said the dust hasn't settled, I also suggested that I'm very happy with how we've implemented our strategies and I am very happy about that, and things appear to be playing out quite well in that regard. But how we get to the end of the year and we see exactly what the actual results are, there is some ambiguity, although changing our guidance and expressing a degree of confidence would suggest that we're pretty happy with where we are and what's going on.\nByron H. Pollitt: Tien-Tsin, I would say that it's clearly weighted to the second half of the year after April 1. If you think in the context of -- a portion of these incentives are assigned to merchant routing, and they trigger when the routing is successfully sent Visa's way. That's going to weight a portion of the incentives that really hasn't -- that isn't as relevant in the first 2 quarters of the year relative to the second. And then the rate of deal activity, which has nothing to do with Durbin, but has to do with the ongoing course of our business, primarily credit, both in the United States and outside the United States, that level of deal activity was just less than we anticipated in the first quarter. And so that will just carry forward into quarters 2, 3 and 4. So we are -- we reaffirmed our guidance as 17% to 18%. We still feel good about that. No real call-outs, just timing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.\nJames E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So Joe, you mentioned that you've been happy with your strategy implementation. Byron, you mentioned that the Durbin incentives were lower than you had modeled. I guess if you had to summarize it at this vantage point, has Durbin turned out to be better, worse or the same than you had originally contemplated?\nJoseph W. Saunders: I think it's modestly better than what we had contemplated. I think that the implementation of our strategy has put us at the better part of that, which is what I've said about the regulation pretty consistently. So I don't -- I just -- I don't know how to put it in total perspective because as I said earlier, we got to see what happens. In some cases, there's been accelerated early adoption. And in some cases, there's been less early adoption. And I think it appears like it's going to even out, and it appears like things will occur in a manner that we've anticipated. When I say that, I'm not really factoring in the potential positive effect of some of the things that we've done to drive volume to us over time. And we will have to see how that works out with the -- through the acquirers and the merchant community.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I guess one question for Joe and then another for Byron. I guess Joe, what kind of impact do you expect in the model, with the change in pricing that's going to go on, on April 1? And I know it's going to be a change in pricing for all products. It's not just debit. I know it includes credit. I'm just curious on what kind of impact do you think it will have. And then Byron, when we look at the international revenues, they're now, for 2 quarters in a row, growing faster than the cross border volume growth. Is that just better pricing that we're getting? What is driving that phenomenon the past 2 quarters?\nByron H. Pollitt: So let me answer the international one first. So we reported nominal growth at 12%, and there was a 19% increase in revenue. Whenever there is significant above-average currency volatility, then our revenue stream trends up. And then -- and so that's the primary delta that you are seeing. It doesn't have anything to do with our pricing. It's much more a function of currency volatility, and that has largely been courtesy of Europe and the unfolding drama around the euro. With regards to -- let me see if I understand the question. On balance in U.S. debit, when you combine the fixed acquiring network fee with the lower variable transaction fees associated with U.S. debit, this constitutes a net price reduction. And that has been completely folded into our guidance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So have your common switch plans and network participation fee plans met any meaningful obstacles? And could you provide more specifics on how the common switch and network participation fee will be implemented presumably in coming months here?\nJoseph W. Saunders: I think that what we've done, we've announced 2 quarters ago, and we've consistently talked about, I think any time you change the paradigm that there's probably some consternation somewhere along the way. But in general, we've met with -- it's been pretty benign, and we've met with favorable receptivity. I would say out of our largest merchants, there are a significant number of them that have signed contracts with us that anticipate the fixed fee. And they're fine with it. I mean I suppose that doesn't mean that they won't complain about it later, but that's kind of the history of our business. As it relates to that, we're putting -- officially we'll put out the specifications for that in about the -- in the next week. As it relates to activate -- fully activating the PIN capability on the Visa debit card, that would begin on April 1. And all of those things are going along as we anticipated, as we had planned. We're very happy with the way that it turned out. And as you might expect, I mean there's been a lot of water that's gone under the bridge. They're both complicated paradigms. As Byron says, we feel that we're in a much better position in the long run with a modest fixed fee and a lower variable fee. We believe that, that suits merchants in a much more compatible way than in the past because they can take advantage of economies of scale. It is not price increases. As we speak today, as it relates to the PIN capability on the signature cards, that seems to be the way things are moving. It's a capability that we have, and we're very comfortable with that as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.\nDavid Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Joe, could you highlight some of the innovation you have planned on the credit side? You indicated that a credit volume growth was twice what debit was in the U.S. in December and much of the growth came from the affluent. So how do you see the competitive battle shaping up in U.S. credit versus MasterCard particularly on the affluent side?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well when I look back over the last 2 or 3 years, I mean I'm very comfortable with how we fared and what we've done. Based on the number of things that I talked about in my remarks, I'm very bullish on where we're going to wind up in 2012 as a result of some new transactions that are on the cusp of occurring. That doesn't mean that I don't consider MasterCard to be a formidable competitor because they are. It doesn't mean that every time we get involved in a transaction, that we'll win and they'll lose. But I'd have to say as it regards to credit, we're in a pretty good position. Remember, we've talked the last 2 quarters about the United-Continental merger and our win in that regard. I think as I mentioned in my remarks, we have the best array of co-branded partners, period. And that is what's driving a lot of the growth. So we feel like we're in a very good position. We don't feel that, that's a position through which we can rest on our laurels. We do believe that V.me and the wallet and the single click is going to make a difference in the credit card world, as well as the debit card world. So I think we're trying to move forward in a very measured way and we're pretty excited about our prospects. And the same goes for our international business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Bruce, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: My question actually kind of follows on to that, to the last one in. In terms of the trends that you see within debit and credit, is it -- are you able to tell if this growth in credit is -- whether it be affluent or a broader growth in credit usage or if there's actually consumers making a conscious choice to pick up a credit card versus a debit card? Just as you think about those different trends, are you seeing anything that is fundamentally where consumers are choosing a credit card over a debit card or if it's just that a selection that issuers are pushing more credit cards versus debit?\nJoseph W. Saunders: Well remember the credit card volume has been growing quite robustly for several quarters now. And so you certainly couldn't attribute what's happening in that product totally to Durbin and people switching. And it's too early to tell, looking at the volumes exactly, what kind of switch there may be. Anecdotally, of course you know that rewards have been removed from debit cards and rewards exist on credit cards. So there are probably -- I mean just logically, you have to assume that there's some movement in that regard. Some of that is constrained by the credit worthiness of individuals and their credit lines. And so it's pretty complicated environment and it's a little bit difficult to say. Obviously issuers seem to be pushing their credit businesses a little bit more strongly or a lot more strongly than they do their debit businesses at this point in time, which is what one would expect. So I think that the jury is still out about how much something moves from one to the other. But I think it's pretty clear that you're going to see strong credit card growth at least from Visa in the foreseeable future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.\nJulio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Byron, this is directly for you. I guess just in terms of the numbers, and I apologize if I missed any of this. But the 9% processed transaction gross versus the 13% data processing revenue growth, obviously, the effects of Durbin and some of the impacts there on debit are a big part of the decline of processed. But the spread relative to the revenue growth was actually much better than expected. So just some color in terms of why that spread went the way that it did and for how long would this actually continue to persist before you see that in your portfolio anniversary?\nByron H. Pollitt: So the debit processing fees grew at 8%, but we reported at the gross level data processing fee growth of 13%. Of that delta, I would say 60% of it is due to the addition of CyberSource and PlaySpan transactions into the data processing line. And the other 40% is due to value-added services that show up in the other fee category of data processing. And so those are -- that explains 100% of the premium that we are earning above the growth -- underlying growth in data processing transactions. And I would expect that, that premium -- certainly, the CyberSource and PlaySpan piece will continue. We'll have to see how that plays out in the second half of the year as we see much more impact from, or potential impact from implementation of the Federals.\nOperator: The last question does come from Bill Carcache with Nomura.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: I'd like to follow up on some of your comments about Fundamo and your investments in MobileMoney. Does what you're doing there influence your relationship with Western Union in any way? And can you update us on whether you expect to be able to deal with some of the AML issues that arise in mobile money transfer? And just more broadly, can you comment on where you see the cost of electronic-money transfers going especially in comparison to that 500 to 600 basis points of revenues per dollar volume that Western Union has traditionally generated.\nJoseph W. Saunders: I don't think that there's an absolute connection between Fundamo and Western Union and the Western Union-type of business. Remember, I think Fundamo is an incredible part of our future. I think that using mobile technology as an access point to Visa prepaid cards in emerging economies, where there's a lot of under, under-banked people is just one of the most incredible things that I've seen coming along in quite some time. As it relates to money transfer and Western Union, we are much more heavily involved with Western Union today, and will be in 2012 than we really ever have been before. And we are doing a number of things with them and some of the -- as it relates to money transfer in some of the emerging economies. And I'm going to kind of leave it -- leave Western Union at that. But we also, as you know, do business with MoneyGram. And I mean we're pretty invested in money transfer business for the unbanked. We are aware of the issues that surround the transfer of money and the protections that it requires and so forth and so on. And we're doing things through people that have those infrastructures. And we're happy where we are right now. Let me say we're happy to be doing what we're doing, and we will continue to endeavor to.\nJack Carsky: Well thank you all for joining us today.

Let me begin with my usual call outs and observations. First, some color on the fourth quarter\u2019s net revenue growth. As reported, net revenue grew 9%, three call outs, starting with gross revenue. For the quarter, we grew at a healthy 11% rate. Turning to the incentive line, during the quarter, we closed 73 major deals, compared to a quarterly average of 53 for the 2013 fiscal year. This resulted in an incentive rate of 18.6% for Q4, which is well within the neighborhood we signaled on our Q3 earnings call. When combined with the first three fiscal quarters, incentives as a percent of gross revenues came in at 16.5%, right in the middle of our 16% to 17% guidance range for the full year.  Finally, the FX headwind, which has accelerated in the second half of the year, reached about 1.5 percentage points of drag on revenue growth in Q4. The full year FX headwind was just under 1% for fiscal 2013. We expect this headwind to continue to grow in fiscal 2014 to about 2 percentage points of drag on reported revenue growth net of our hedges. Second callout relates to full-year revenue growth. We began fiscal '13 with revenue guidance of low double-digits and refined the guidance to around 13% on the Q3 call. We end the year with revenue growth up 13% after absorbing the impact of heightened deal activity in Q4 and a growing unfavorable FX impact. Third callout relates to the most recent U.S. payment volume trends. While rest of world payment volume and global cross-border trends remained in double-digit growth territory for the September ending quarter, U.S. domestic payment volume dropped from 11% growth in August to 8% in the month of September. While October's first three weeks have upticked slightly to 9%, there has currently been some constraint in U.S. consumer spend, showing up in our numbers in both debit and credit. Our guidance encompasses what we are seeing in September and October and presumes that a tepid recovery in U.S. economic growth continues. Fourth callout relates to operating income and EPS, which grew 15% and 20% respectively, versus fiscal 2012 adjusted results. Included in our Q4 results was a restructuring reserve of $44 million, representing about $0.04 of EPS. This restructuring reserve reflects a streamlining of our cost structure, aimed at achieving greater alignment between our costs and our strategic priorities, and capturing organizational efficiencies as we adapt to changes in our management structure. Finally, fifth callout -- we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. Three highlights: First, as announced last week, we raised our quarterly dividend per share by 21% to $0.40. Second, during Q4, we repurchased over 7 million shares at an average price of $177 per share, returning $1.3 billion to shareholders.  Finally third, we announced a new $5 billion share repurchase program, our largest ever. Please note this buyback program has no expiration date and is in addition to $251 million, still remaining under our prior authorization. This means purchases could take place throughout fiscal 2014 and in 2015 as well. Now let's turn to the numbers. As is my practice, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the fiscal fourth quarter, followed by our results through October 21. I will then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2014. Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 13% on par with the June quarter's 13%. This was driven by a sustained growth in all of our regions. More recently in the U.S., through October 21, payment volume growth was 9% compared with 10% in the September ending quarter.  Drilling down further, U.S. credit growth was 9% through October 21, compared to 11% in Q4. Similarly, debit growth at 8% in October compared to 10% in Q4. While a decline in U.S. gas prices is part of the story, there is also a modest down shift in other retail segments. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 11% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter on par with the 11% rate in the June quarter. The U.S. grew 10% and the rest of world 11%. Through October 21st, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 13% with the U.S. growth rate of 10% and the rest of world at 14%. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $15.5 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 14% increase over the prior-year period. U.S. grew 10% while the rest of world delivered 28% growth. Through October 21st, processed transaction growth was 13%. Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, a 9% increase year-over-year driven by solid growth globally in both domestic and international transactions and as mentioned earlier, we strained by a significant increase in incentives tied to deal activity and a growing FX headwind. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was $11.8 billion, up 13% over the prior year and at the high end of our beginning of the year guidance of low double digits. Moving to the individual revenue line items; service revenue was $1.4 billion up 10% over the prior year and was driven by solid global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions inside and outside the U.S. and continuing strong CyberSource transaction growth. As we signaled last quarter, we have fully lapped the implementation of U.S. debit regulation, resulting in revenue growth that more closely approximates growth in process transactions. International transaction revenue was up 13% to $899 million reflecting solid strength in cross-border volumes and a continuing benefit from higher currency volatility. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up only 1% from the prior year results. Personnel costs were up 6% for the quarter and 12% year-over-year in support of our gross strategies around the globe, which heavily emphasized the investments in our country teams outside the U.S. along with our newer product initiatives. That said, in Q4, we also took a $44 million restructuring reserves for the reasons discussed earlier. This callout is important when considering a run rate for personnel cost as we move into fiscal year 2014. Marketing expenses were flat from the prior year and declined 6% sequentially primarily as a result of lower media spend. Operating margin was 59% for the fourth quarter and 61% for the full fiscal year, both in line with our guidance of around 60%. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 32.5% and well higher than our full-year guidance of 30% to 32%, the full year figure of 31.4% was within our guidance range. Capital expenditures were $138 million in the quarter and totaled $471 million for the full year. This was at the top end of our expected range going into the year. At the end of the fiscal quarter, we had 638 million shares of class A common stock outstanding on as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted share is outstanding for the quarter, totaled $644 million and for the year totaled $656 million. Finally, in terms of guidance, we have previously provided fiscal $2014 metrics around revenues, EPS and free cash flow. Let\u2019s start there. Given our expectation for our significant FX headwind in 2014. We are reframing our revenue growth guidance going forward, leading with a constant dollar growth rate, which is consistent with the payment volume metrics we provide each quarter and better represents the underlying growth and health of our business. Then we will provide the expected FX impact for the year. So, for fiscal year 2014, we expect constant dollar revenue growth of low-double-digits and an FX headwind of around two percentage points.  A little further color on revenue. Given the continued slow pace of global economic recovery, combined with the growing impact of a strong U.S. dollar, our expectations today are slightly lower than they were in June on Investor Day. That said, our expectations for diluted earnings per share remains the same and continues to be mid to high-teens.  Free cash flow guidance of about $5 billion reflects the partial reversal of a 2013 tax deduction associated with the eventual return of Visa's share of the multi-district litigation cash payment, as a result of merchants opting out of the multi-district litigation class settlement. As I mentioned in June at Investor Day, this event, combined with the non-recurring deduction in fiscal 2013 associated with our multi-district litigation settlement payment, will lower free cash flow from $6.9 billion in fiscal 2013 to about $5 billion in fiscal 2014. New guidance metrics for the full year 2014 include the following. Client incentive, as a percentage of gross revenue, will move up modestly next year within an expected range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Our annual operating margin is expected to show a very modest improvement over the past couple of years, which means we expect it to remain in the low 60s. Finally, we have made the decision to discontinue providing quantitative guidance on marketing expense, capital expenditures and tax rate. We are moving in this direction because of the track record we have established since our IPO in 2008. Given the progress we have made with, and now the stability of these metrics, we deem them right for retirement. However, having said that, and to provide some parting color, we would view marketing and CapEx as likely increasing over time, commensurate with overall growth but at manageable rate. While we'll always seek opportunities to optimize our tax rate, we are not going to see the same magnitude of sustained improvement that we were able to drive in the first five years of our public life. We expect to see more modest incremental improvement only.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf : Thanks very much, Byron and good afternoon to everyone. I thought I would start with just a few comments about the fourth quarter and then move on to some other topics. First of all, we feel very good about the continued strong financial performance that Visa has exhibited with no surprises to speak of. As Byron mentioned, our revenue growth of 9% and on a gross basis at 11%, was reflective of heavy incentives during the quarter as we anticipated, and we just think of those as a good thing. That is getting more long-term deals signed with our clients, is clearly a positive for us. Global payment volume growth of 13%, consistent with the prior quarter, expense growth of 1%, as we talked about including $44 million of severance, 50% net income growth while we bought back 7 million shares for about $1.3 billion.  All this contributed to EPS growth of 20%, again including the effect of those incentives during the quarter and restructuring. All that added into the 2013 full year performance of 13% revenue growth, 8% expense growth, translating to 23% EPS growth all in line with the guidance that we've been giving.  Let me turn now and just give a couple of updates on other topics. And I'll start with litigation and regulation. First, I will start here in the United States. As I think most of you are aware, we are waiting final ruling on the MDL, the multi-district litigation case. A decision is expected at anytime. We continue to remain confident that the court will approve the agreement as we\u2019ve said in the past. Also within the United States, again I think most people do know that U.S. District Court Judge, Richard Leon ruled on July 31st that the Federal Reserve implement certain parts of the Durbin provision of Dodd-Frank in properly, specifically related to the level of interchange and at the networking provisions. Just a couple of comments on the judge Leon ruling. First of all, we are pleased that the Federal Reserve filed the notice of the appeal in August and that the Fed was granted a stay in July, pending the result of its appeal. Our review of the appeal papers filed by the Federal Reserve leads us to believe that the government has got a strong case on appeal relative to the timing as best as we know there is no timeline proposed for when the case will be argued or decided. However, the briefings are expected to be completed by the December 4th of this year. Over in Europe, we\u2019ve talked about a series of things there. In the past, there is really no new news with anything that we\u2019ve discussed, including the Visa Europe push. Let move on now and talk about tokenization for a minute. On the last quarterly call I spoke at length about our thoughts on tokenization and where we viewed our role. We made a significant announcement this quarter, which I hope you saw. We, along with our partners in the industry, MasterCard and American Express announced the set of standards to move toward a newly tokenized payment environment. This will serve several purposes. First of all, as we all know it\u2019s just good for security, removing sensitive information, crossing the payment system is good for every network participant. But probably more importantly for the long-term it creates a framework, as new network participants emerge to ensure the security and the integrity of the payment system is in fact maintained. And when I talk about the integrity of the payment system, I\u2019m including protecting the position that we have and our clients have in the value chain and that\u2019s something that\u2019s obviously very important to us. It\u2019s early days, they are just standards as they have been defined but we are working both on the technical implementation of this, as well as the practical implications with more to come in the future. But we think this could lead to some exciting things. Next update, I will turn to V.me for a second. We\u2019ve spoken before about the convergence of physical point-of-sale, e-commerce and mobile. You hear everywhere you go. Our objective is simple with V.me. It\u2019s, people talk about wallet sometimes is if they are very confusing to us and what our goals are, they are very, very simple and straight forward. We want to replicate the simplicity, the speed and the security of a transaction just like people have today when they swipe, dip or tap a card. It\u2019s that simple. We\u2019ve learned a great deal since I arrived at Visa through discussions with issuers, acquirers and merchants relative to our own development of V.me, and we are in the process of simplifying our product, becoming targeted towards the goal of creating the simple, fast and secure online and mobile acceptance. The feedback has been hugely valuable. Our product is going to be issuer, acquirer and merchant focused that\u2019s relative to the blending and the data flow. We are working to make it easier to integrate into merchant websites and into mobile applications and we\u2019ve done this in collaboration with our clients and the feedback has been positive and we are optimistic. Having said that, we have made significant progress, we have over a 150 financial institutions and about 60 e-commerce retailers offering V.me within United States, Canada and Australia today and we have an additional 300 merchants signed and are in various stages of integration. We move on now and just talk for a second about network security. In my year here as I\u2019ve gotten the opportunity to talk to many of you and read many things that gets sent across about what's going on in our industry, there is a great deal discussed about the potential disintermediation of existing payment systems. And just relative to network security I just -- I want to make clear that I don\u2019t think people should underestimate the value existing payment networks have regarding security. Criminals across the globe are becoming, they are more of them, they are becoming smarter, they are better funded and they are becoming more vault. Their tax are becoming more frequent and much, much more complex. We as a company and the established people in the marketplace here have been dealing with these risks for years, in our case 40 to 50 years. We've invested billions of dollars to secure our network. And you just have to remind yourself, people use networks because they trust them and they will use them until they don't trust them anymore. And then when they don't, those networks won't exist. We understand that and work every day to protect our environment and just keep in mind that risk takes several forms. The first is just practical day-to-day fraud. We spend an awful lot of energy working on our data analytics as our clients do despite (inaudible) just a common everyday fraud. Our transactions are screened by us and our financial partners on a real-time basis. The modeling to do this has been developed over 40 to 50 years and we have driven fraud rates down to historic lows, at the point where they are less than $0.06 for every $100 transacted over our network or actually lost to fraud. The second risk is the scary one and it's perpetrators getting access to the network. Just remind everyone that we have a centralized processing architecture that allows us to scan, evaluate, protect, and react to any risk that we see as necessary. As a company as I said, huge resources, huge amount of our time as a management team and we have some of the most talented people and sophisticated technology to combat threats and are committed to continue investing in this. As we think about these risks, again I just wanted to point out these risks are very real. These aren\u2019t things that are people are concerned about that might never come to fruition, they will go to the weakest link in the system. As I think most of you know the White House is directly engaged in this as is the President himself and we certainly feel that having secure environment like our established payments network is a great place to be as these risks continue to increase. Now let me just turn and just talk for a second about almost a year that I have spent at Visa and just share a few of my thoughts. And some of these -- many of these don't relate to anything that I've done but relate to the broader team at Visa. First of all, this company has delivered growth consistently and delivered on what it said it would do since the IPO. I personally remain confident in our ability to continue to grow the franchise over the long term. The opportunities are hugely significant; they are global, they are technology driven, and they are based on partnerships that we have and we will continue to strengthen across the globe. First of all on Globality. Again I had the opportunity since I have joined the company to spend a lot of time overseas. I visited over a dozen countries, I probably met with 40 to 50 financial institutions from the very largest to some of the very smallest, met with two dozen acquirers, met with many merchants and government officials in five countries. You all know and I think we talked about this that our business outside the U.S. is growing at a rate much faster than inside the U.S., but the opportunities within both are still hugely significant. We talked at Investor Day that the displacement of cash is still the big opportunity for us. 41% of transactions in the developed world are still cash and check. 62% in the emerging markets that translates to over 11 trillion of cash and check in our geographies, which excludes Visa Europe and those numbers are growing. What's been most striking to me as I have had the opportunity to travel across the world is the extent to which governments understand the huge benefits of moving payments to electronic means and the desired to partner with us to bring about this change and that's in fact what we're doing. As I just alluded to technology is also a huge driver of the opportunity we have in front of us. Cash is in fact the enemy. Electronic solutions just are far superior, they are safer, they are more secure. We have some of the best products in the world. Our products are accepted to include mobile point of acceptance between 36 million and 40 million locations across the globe. We have over 2.1 billion cards outstanding, a full set of products and again a tradition of safety, security and soundness. We all know data and mobile create the opportunity to accelerate that electronification and we have continued and will continue to build out our capabilities here. We've also talked a lot about partnership. Our clients are much more than clients, they are partners. Our issuers have always looked at us that way that we are strategic partner for them in building their business. When we talk to a lot of people on the outside, they like to talk about the price of our network. When we talk to most of our issuers, absolutely they're concerned about price but they are equally concerned about the ideas and the assets that we can bring to help them grow their client relationships and that\u2019s what we spend our time inside the company working to develop, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been -- it's what been done for years. The same is true for the acquirers. And I have said we are building the DNA in these capabilities to create those kinds of merchant partnerships that we do have in some parts of the world but we need certainly here in the United States and elsewhere. We have a long way to go. We know it\u2019s critical for our success but we do want to be viewed as a partner to grow their business at a fair price, and we will be flexible. We will customize our efforts here as long as we preserve the things that I talked about. They are important to us and the network. And in short, we feel great about the future. So everything we\u2019ve been talking about -- about our future is still in fact the same. Let me just shift gears now and just talk for a second about capital. Since our IPO, we\u2019ve been consistent about how we have thought about capital management. And since I\u2019ve come on board, I have reaffirmed the same principles that have existed within the company. To date, the company has repurchased the equivalent of about 151 million shares or about 20% of the company\u2019s shares outstanding. We\u2019ve returned nearly 17 billion of capital for shareholders. Let me just walk through a couple of principles which I laid out on our prior call but let me just do it again. We believe the highest and best use of our excess capital is reinvesting it first organically in our business, then through acquisitions to further our growth. After supporting that growth, we believe in continuing to grow our dividend and we think about targeting a 20% payout ratio of prior year net income. The final use is buying back our stock, just a few notes for a second. We treat decisions to invest our capital for both organic and acquisition purposes of series independent discrete decisions. And we conduct vigorous analysis on all of those. And so we get excited when we find investments whether they are organic investments or acquisitions that has those tests and we are constantly searching for ways to grow those things. We also understand the value of the consistent and fair dividend to our investors. So our goal is to grow the dividend as our net income grows. And our stated goal has been and continues to be to return the majority of excess free cash flow through our investors. We\u2019ve done this through aggressive buybacks and we will continue to do this always with an eye towards valuation. We understand that when we buy our stock back we are making an investment decision and to the extent that we are buying the stock back that tells you what we believe the future of this company is like. As you\u2019ve seen, we continued that practice through this quarter. We announced the 21% increase in our dividend from $0.33 per share per quarter to $0.40 per share. This equates to 20% of that prior year net income as I alluded to earlier and that\u2019s the way we think about it. We also announced our tenth and most significant share repurchase authorization to date, about -- which was $5 billion. Both of these decisions, as I said reflects our belief in returning excess capital to shareholders and in our confidence of our future. And speaking of the future, just a few last words, before we open it up for questions. Byron commented that through August 21st, we\u2019ve seen solid payment in transaction growth across the world, some weakness here in the U.S. with some strong growth elsewhere. As we said, the recovery had not accelerated and certainly continues as you look across the world and our financial guidance reflects this tepid global growth and volatility in the foreign exchange markets. We do expect one day to benefit from stronger economic growth, we just don\u2019t know when yet. Looking ahead to 2014 and beyond, I continue to remain excited and energized about Visa and the opportunity that we had to continue growing the business from the topline. We continue to focus on the same initiatives that we outlined at the Investor Day. The secular opportunity to penetrate cash and check, PCE remains healthy across the globe. We are working hard to expand the value of VisaNet. We are continuing to invest in our future and we continue to think about being more flexible and adapted to the business needs of our customers as we seek to become closer partners with them. So on closing, I would just like to thank the 9,500 global employees of Visa who are all working hard every single day to build a better company for all of our shareholders. And with that operator, Byron and I would love to take some questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. \nJason Kupferberg - Jefferies: So just on the currency, I know it's unusual if you guys have a callout of this magnitude. Is it mostly the volatility in the Brazilian real or are there some other specific currencies and you simply didn't enough hedging in place? And then just as a follow on to that, does the top-line impact that we saw in Q4 and that we are projecting for fiscal '14, is that similar impact on the bottom line?\nByron Pollitt: So, let me respond to that. So on currency, I'll just remind everyone, we hedge one year out on a rolling basis. So literally every month, we put hedges on, hedges come off. So we'll never be perfectly matched with regards to our foreign exchange exposure, unless literally there is no volatility whatsoever in the rate. We hedge 14 currencies, we do business in 180. The impact does include the Brazilian reais but it is more than that. It includes the Aussie dollar, the yen, the Canadian dollar.  So there are a handful of currencies that have -- that are causing this impact, not just limited to Brazil. The primary impact is revenue. There is a more modest offset in expenses. Obviously, expenses incurred in other currencies that are brought back to the U.S. dollar actually translate at a lower level. So the impact on the bottom line is moderated by the expense benefit but it doesn't moderate it all that much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Craig Maurer of CLSA. \nCraig Maurer - CLSA: Couple of questions. First, the high deal volume in the fiscal fourth quarter. Could you please discuss, if you can, the pricing trajectory and high level for those deals versus what you were seeing during the rest of 2013? And secondly just thinking about growth outside the U.S. we're hearing that the Mexican banks are lobbying hard for Visa and MasterCard to be allowed to process locally. Any thoughts on those discussions or the timeline for that? \nByron Pollitt: Let me take the first one. When we gave our guidance on the Q3 call, when we guided to 16% to 17% incentives for the year, the incentive rate that we ended up incurring in Q4 is very, very consistent with that guidance and very consistent with how we expected deals to sort out. And as it relates to pricing, I would say there is no major callout here on pricing. I think the perspective we would leave you with is we were pretty much spot on in the end of year and Q4 incentive guidance, which should give you some comfort around how we anticipated those deals to be priced. The reason as I alluded to in my remarks -- the reason that the incentives are so high is because we did a significantly higher number of important deals in that quarter -- something that's not unusual. So our incentives are lumpy and we don't guide by quarter, we guide on the full year. And so that's the perspective we would offer on that front. Charlie, do you want to pick Mexico?\nCharlie Scharf: Sure, on Mexico, certainly and I think if you think back to the Investor Day, Bill Sheedy talked a great deal about what we believe as the opportunity outside of the United States to increasing our processing penetration. Mexico is certainly one of those markets. I've been there and we\u2019ve had the conversation about the value that we think our processing capabilities can bring to the banks. And so we are hopeful and trying to be helpful that our processing capabilities will be useful in that marketplace. Just unrelated note on Mexico because I didn't cover it in my remarks but I do think it's an exciting thing for us. We announced today that we\u2019ve signed an agreement with the joint venture between Grupo Bimbo, which is the largest Mexican owned baking company and Blue Label Telecoms Limited, which is a leading provider of prepaid airtime. The significance is we\u2019ve also talked a great deal about the opportunity to increase acceptance in the markets that aren\u2019t as developed as United States. This is an opportunity for us to work with the capacity that Bimbo has and potentially add up to a 150,000 point-of-sale terminals using their distribution capabilities. So it\u2019s something that we are very excited about and when we think about increasing acceptance, we think about processing. It\u2019s certainly one of the bigger opportunities for us.\nOperator: Our next question will come from -- yes, so the next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMC. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JPMC: Great. Thanks. Just on the incentive line, the 73 major deals, how many of these were new deals for Visa versus renewals? And then I guess, looking at \u201914, should we expect a more normal year for deal activity?\nByron Pollitt: Well, I don\u2019t have it immediately handy, how many were new versus renewals. What I can provide is additional color is the majority of those were outside the United States with a heavy focus on the Asia-Pacific and CEMEA region. With regards to \u201914, I\u2019m not quite sure what a normal year would be, but we are giving you our guidance relative to incentives. And what I can say is that if you look at it, say from the perspective of our top 10 global clients, none of those are scheduled for exploration or renewals in the upcoming year \u201914.\nCharlie Scharf: And I just wanted to add to that, what Byron said earlier, which is again, we don\u2019t guide quarterly on incentives because we know it\u2019s going to be lumpy and this -- while it\u2019s a large number, not a surprise to us. And again to the extent that we are signing up people either earlier or more of them, we think those are good things. And over the course of the year, those things tend to balance out, which is why we provided the guidance that we provided for 2014.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital. You may go ahead.\nDan Perlin - RBC Capital: Thanks. So as we think about \u201914, little bit more on the incremental investment side, you mentioned a lot of things going on here. But you did highlight previously that about 80% of your investments incrementally up to this point have been on products, technology and infrastructure and the remaining 20% was kind of on international markets. And I\u2019m just wondering it sounds like it might be tilting more towards international markets and should we expect kind of the incremental margins from that to be similar, better or worse because your margin guidance for me seem like it was biased to the upside? Thanks.\nByron Pollitt: See, how do we respond to that? I think that if you were to -- I think those ratios continued to work. I would say that when we talk about 80% of investment going into product, a lot of that is capital. When you think of the investment that goes into rest of world and in countries outside other than the United States and we think of headcount, a lot of that is going into our country teams and we consider those investments because more people were at our best when we are present locally serving clients locally. And so the margins are highest when we are leveraging transactions over the network in our core businesses. And they are less when we are investing in products and services that begin to move away from the network. They extend the network but they don't directly -- they are transactions that require additional investment and additional costs in order to drive the transactions to the network. And so the way we talked about it, I think on Investor Day is probably a good way of continuing to think about it over -- in '14 and '15. Charlie, do you want to add anything?\nCharlie Scharf: The only color I\u2019d add is where you round up which is -- as we sit here today and we obviously -- we have our plans for next year and all the glorious detail that you would expect, we don't look at the distribution of those investments as being at all significantly different than we thought at investor day. It's still the same set of opportunities, the growth opportunities outside the U.S. have been hugely significant for this company. It's where the majority of the headcount growth has been over a period of time. So we would expect where we invest to look very similar as we develop the products and services that we talked about.\nOperator: Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. \nDarrin Peller - Barclays: Just when we look at the volume trends through September and October, first of all, I mean just comment on some of the moving parts here in terms of maybe the government shutdown impact thing or any other variables? And then when you think about your '14 guidance, is that inclusive of this kind of a run rate for the U.S. trending maybe in the 8% range versus the 9% range versus what you have seen in past few months?\nByron Pollitt: So on the U.S. side, I would say it is continuation -- as we said in the remarks, it is the continuation of a tepid recovery. And so somewhere in the zip code of what we have been seeing is what we would expect to see going forward. And I'm sorry the first part of your question was the government?\nCharlie Scharf: Yes, so I'll just repeat what Byron said. He also said this in his opening remarks, which is that our guidance encompasses what we are seeing in September and October. And as Byron said that our guidance presumes that we do have this tepid recovery of the U.S. economy. And then what\u2019s relative to the government, it certainly appears from our -- looking at our information that the government shutdown certainly has an impact, very hard to prove, very hard to understand exactly what the impact is. So it's more guess than anything else. And certainly to the extent that the U.S. government can get its act together on the debt limit and on the budget, we would expect that to change the trajectory of what we would see for consumer spend.\nOperator: Our next question is from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. \nGlenn Fodor - Autonomous Research: Charlie, given your experience at a place that was impacted by Dodd-Frank's debit regulation and the looming second round of potential actions here, can you just put your bank hat on and share with us your views as, if this does go through how issuers may approach their response to further debit interchange reductions and/or loss of exclusivity on signature and how could that impact the networks?\nCharlie Scharf: Sure. I'll answer the question relative to in my current job conversations that we have had with issuers and our sense for the way people are thinking about it. Listen I think; first of all relative to the level of interchange, it certainly depends on where the rule ultimately comes out. When issuers first were dealing with the Durbin reduction down to $0.22, there was a lot of talk that went into people's desire to support the product and the $0.22, while people don't make much money on the product, the consumers like the product. And they still felt the need to support it and we see strong debit growth at that point. As the number drops, if the number drops significantly below that, people do have to rethink what that means. We always have to remind ourselves that we can sit around and talk about what we like and our issuers can do the same. But there are customers on the other end that are using these products. And consumers like debit cards, they like to segregate their money. They like to have control over what they spend relative to the amount of money that\u2019s in their bank account and all of the safeguards, checks, alerts and all the things that go along with that. And forcing consumer behavior to change is a very hard and very dangerous thing to do and not one, that I think -- at least if I could tell banks take it lightly. So we\u2019re still depending on where the numbers come out confident that the support will still be there and for some reason, people chose to look another way. There are very good prepaid products in the market place which are -- could be important drivers of their business and our business as is the case with credit cards. And we just remind ourselves, the credit card business is very different than it was 10 years ago. Credit card companies are predominantly controlled by banks that look at the entirety of the relationship. And the entirety of that relationship allows them to make credit decisions that they wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable making years and years ago and to the extent that they can make those credit decisions, put controls and alert some parameters around that, that consumers like, that certainly an option. So lots of things unfolding here. Obviously it depends on where the appeal turn itself up. And then just relative to network routing, I guess, the only thing I\u2019d say on that one is, that one is very complicated. It\u2019s not clear that the system is capable of handling that today. The system, we thought about broadly whether it\u2019s physical devices, whether its networks, whether its acquirers, processors or anything like that. And so that one, I think we will -- we will wait and see what happens in the appeal scored and go forward from there.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - KBW: Thank you. Just a question back on the U.S. spending trends. I was wondering if there was more elaboration around the trends. Byron, you mentioned certain verticals being impact as well. I was wondering maybe what those verticals were and maybe what consumer segments you might have seen the impact. And then just one data point question, when I look at the card service, the purchase volume ratio that declined a lot more in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter. And I was just wondering if you could just help me with what might have attributed to that. Thank you.\nByron Pollitt: With regards to the softening in the U.S. retail spend, clearly gas is important. We are looking in an average price per gallon in October of $3.36 which for us is 12% below where it was at the same time a year ago. And that shows up in a significant way in the shortfall, I would say other verticals that show up, supermarkets, various elements of travel, a number of categories that we would traditionally associate with small business. And when you look at the spread, its pretty broad based with and I would almost say after gas that what -- I think what struck us with how many categories you would naturally associate with small business. With regards to the second part of your question, I\u2019m not familiar with the ratio that you\u2019re enquiring about. Could you rephrase that real quick?\nSanjay Sakhrani - KBW: I guess, I look at card service revenues to purchase volume. Card service fees to purchase volume and that ratio is kind of in the -- it was like 12.67% relative to the 12. -- like 12.75 last quarter. And when I look at the year-over-year decline, that decline was a little bit more than what we saw last quarter?\nByron Pollitt: Yes. It\u2019s a metric we don\u2019t typically look at -- so this is service fee over PV. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at to the extent that we have been adjusting our pricing so that more of what we book ends up in data processing versus service fees as well as the case with a major U.S. bank that recently signed up for 10 years. That would impact that ratio but beyond that, I don't really have a comment. But we will look at that and see whether there is some additional insight that we can address in our future call. \nOperator: Our next question is from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Bernstein: Yes. I just wanted to inquire more about the restructuring actions. Can you just provide more specifics on what the restructuring actions were and what prompted them? And also whether there is more to come. And then I guess related to this on a more strategic level, does the need for some restructuring recently -- meaning you\u2019re needing more levers to keep your margin trajectory, it seems that given the inherent operating leverage in your business, you probably don't need significant restructuring to hit your margin target at this point but I wanted to enquire about that in case we are missing something.\nCharlie Scharf: I mean just -- let me start -- we don't believe in using restructuring to manage margins. We use restructuring, if there are things that we want to do to right-size different parts of the company. This is not expected to continue, doesn't mean that we won't learn things as time goes on and decide to move resources around the company but that's exactly what this is. The majority of this restructuring comes from a sharpened focus on what we are doing in our global products area. As you know we have had some leadership changes there over the past couple of months. We spent a lot of time, I referenced in my remarks, talking with our clients about what we are doing, what they want from us and where they want us to focus. And that has directed us to reorient our activities and I think of that by the way as just those activities as normal practice. If we are innovating enough, if we are doing enough things, some of those things will turn out not to be to have all of the opportunity in them and we will course correct and that's what we've done here. So, I think that answers all of your sub-questions. Byron, did I cover everything?\nByron Pollitt: Yes. I think that's good.\nOperator: Our next question is from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. \nSmittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley: Just a quick follow-up to the tokenization discussion that you talked about earlier. Just wondering what is the process timeline for it to move from being a proposal to being a standard and can you talk about the timing on when these standards could potentially get implemented?\nCharlie Scharf: That is a good question. I would be less than accurate if I was too specific. The standards have been published. We have continued to put out some guidelines to our clients as to what fields will have to be available in releases that will come out next year, because this tokenization work requires work of acquirers and processors. And we would hope that some of these solutions would be in the marketplace by the second half of the calendar year, next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research: I just want to -- could you expand again on the spending changes that you see changes in signature, on your high end credit cards, you talked about affluent consumers driving a lot of the spending in the past. Did that change in September, October as well? And I wondered could you just give us an update at the end of the period in terms of what signature debit contribution is to volume revenue and the earnings?\nByron Pollitt: We don't typically break it down between signature or what we refer to now as Visa Debit versus Interlink. I think the important callout here is that we are now lapping the full implementation of Durbin where we had a year where there was a significant and a permanent loss of debit share as a result of the routing. And that's now in our base and so as we begin to lap that, the debit numbers are going to look a whole lot healthier growth numbers than they did a year ago. With regards to specific reference to the affluent, I would -- as we have articulated previously, this remains an affluent led recovery. To the extent that there maybe some lift on debit, at least in the U.S. that would partially be do to a shift from credit to debit as a result of a drop in gasoline pricing. As the price of the fill up gets more within range of immediately accessible fund, it has been our -- it has been our experience that we will see some shift from credit to debit. But that\u2019s a result of the drop in oil prices and since they are in drop mode, that something we wouldn\u2019t surprise, if we saw at the next three [quarters].\nOperator: Our next question is from Bill Carache of Nomura Securities. Your line is open.\nBill Carache - Nomura Securities: Thank you. Charlie, some investors have expressed concern over the inevitability of slower growth at some point, say, the next few years, given that just mathematically you are growing up such a large base? Can you talk about, your confidence and the sustainability of the current mid to high-teens growth as you look to the future? And perhaps comment on whether an eventual slowdown is something that you worry about or is the runaway for growth so large that is not even something that crosses your mind?\nCharlie Scharf: Well, I think, when you show, when you are new at a company that is growing like this. It\u2019s something that you think a lot about and you look a lot about. So, absolutely, it\u2019s something that as I gotten here, I\u2019ve -- I don\u2019t know whether worry is the right word, but certainly spent a lot of time on. Listen, I don\u2019t think that the opportunities for this company are significantly different than they were four, five years ago. In fact we believe that there are things going on in the marketplace that would suggest that that both -- that the opportunities are broader. And I am speaking out, I am not, and again I said this, I know, we are -- well, we are concerned about our quarters and we are concerned about our years. We give guidance. We understand the importance of that. But here we are talking about, our belief that this company can continue to grow for the long-term. The dynamics that exist with cash and check across the globe is a gigantic opportunity. It will take us. I know -- I don\u2019t even know how long it will take us to actually conquer cash and check across the globe. But it\u2019s a very, very long period of time. We also look at all the things that are going on in the world of technology that people initially get concerned about relative to our position. The majority of them we look at and believe there are hugely valuable to us. The network that we have, as I\u2019ve said, it is really, really, really hard to duplicate what we have. A couple of people have networks like this. There always going to be niche players out there, but to tackle the global opportunity that exists in growing payments. You need to have the size and the scale that some of us have. And so this is, one of, the world\u2019s great platform to be able do that. And I don\u2019t feel any worse. In fact, I probably feel better about the long-term growth opportunities from a revenue perspective of the company today than when I first joined and that\u2019s consistent with what I thought at Investor Day.\nJack Carsky: Brad, at this point, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Arvind Ramnani of BNP. Your line is open.\nArvind Ramnani - BNP: Hi. Just one final question, if the Visa believe in kind of being a partner with the issuers, merchants and acquirers, then why there are so many groups out there kind of putting hundreds of millions of dollars into finding a way on Visa? Why is Visa not offering them what they want anyway so badly?\nCharlie Scharf: All right. Well, we\u2019ll just spend some time with you offline because we\u2019ve talked a lot about and I think, I have been very, very open and honest about our need to do business somewhat differently in some parts of the world than we have done it in the past. So there is no question that the participants in the network have to do a better job of balancing out the role of the issuers, the acquirers and merchants. We have not treated them as partners as much as we possibly could, especially in the United States, again other parts of the world we get a very, very different story. And at the heart of a lot of the disagreements that we had, I -- we certainly believe that we have got the opportunity to change the nature of that relationship and that\u2019s why we formed the group under Elizabeth Buse called Global Solution were dedicated to showing up with solutions to help them, grow their business over period of time. I have also said, this is not going to take one month, one quarter or even a couple of quarters. It is going to take a period of time. But, listen, we have the tools, we have the assets and we have the desire to do that. And it\u2019s on us to change nature of those relationships. We started those conversations and overtime, it will be very easy to judge our success. But it\u2019s certainly something that we are excited about because we know that we can add a great deal of value to merchant community. So, with that, I guess, I\u2019ll just wrap up it and thank everyone for taking the time and for the effort and following our stock.\nJack Carsky: That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all very much and if you have any follow up questions feel free to give myself or Victoria a call.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relation section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.\nByron Pollitt: Thank you, Jack. Let me begin with my usual call outs and observations. First, some color on the third quarter\u2019s 17% net revenue growth. It is important to note that this growth rate benefited from the absence of significant one time client incentives incurred in the prior year. without these one time client incentives, revenue growth for Q3 would have been closer to 14%. That said, payment volume growth was broad based globally for the March quarter and we're seeing double-digit growth rates in the June quarter for both credit and debit on a constant dollar basis. Based on these trends, and with three quarters of the fiscal year now on the books, we are raising full year 2013 revenue guidance from to low double-digits to around 13%.  Second, service revenue, though up 7% on year-over-year basis, it was down sequentially from the fiscal second quarter. This was primarily due to the signing of the 10 year Chase deal which was executed in fiscal Q3 but was retroactive to the beginning of Q2. This contract, as discussed on the Q2 earnings call, disproportionately impacted the service revenue line and resulted in offsetting reductions in gross service revenue and related client incentives. Because it was signed in fiscal Q3, the service revenue impacts for both Q2 and Q3 were recorded in the current quarter. This means that Q4 service revenue growth rate should be a more representative indicator of underling growth.  Third, client incentives for the quarter, as a percentage of gross revenue, were 14.8%. As described previously, two quarters of Chase related incentive reductions were booked in Q3. This impact was constant inflation in our most recent full year guidance and we remain comfortable with client incentives as a percent of gross revenue in the 16% to 17% range for the full-year 2013.  Fourth, now that we have fully left implementation of the Dodd-Frank routing rules, beginning in June, quarterly Interlink payment volume growth has turned positive for the first time in over a year. Going forward as we lapse a period during which Visa\u2019s post Dodd-Frank debit strategies took hold, we would expect healthy but moderating revenue growth rates for U.S. debit.  Fifth, given our earnings result year-to-date and our expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter, we are increasing our fiscal 2013 adjusted EPS guidance from around 20% to the low 20s. Lastly, as we remain commitment to returning excess cash to our shareholders, during the quarter we\u2019ve spent approximately $1 billion to repurchase 6 million shares at an average price of approximately $177.00. this leaves $61 million remaining in our prior authorization. And as we announced earlier, our Board recently authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program which will run through July of 2014.  Now, let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the fiscal third quarter, followed by our results through July 21st. I\u2019ll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014.  Global payment volume growth for the June quarter, in constant dollars was 18%. Payment volume growth for the June quarter incomes in dollars was 13% above the March quarter's 9%. This was driven by sustained growth in all of our regions including the U.S. which saw some incremental benefit from the lasting effects associated with U.S. debit regulations. More recently, in the U.S., through July 21, payment volume growth was 10% compared with 11% in the June ending quarter. Drilling down further, U.S. credit growth of 10% held at Q3 levels while debit, which also grew at 10% experienced a healthy but moderating growth rate as we lap the growing impact of the Visa's U.S. debit strategies. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 11% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter which compares to a 10% rate in the March quarter. The U.S. grew 9% and the rest of world 12%. Through July 21, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% with the U.S. growth rate of 9% and the rest of world at 6%. The slowing growth in July is most pronounced outside the U.S. and we believe is due in large part to the timing of Ramadan versus last year. Based on historical travel patterns, we estimate the Ramadan impact to be in the 250 to 300 basis points range for the month and if pass this prologue, we should see a bounce back in August. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $15 billion in the fiscal third quarter, a 14% increase over the prior year period. The U.S. grew 12% while the rest of world delivered 23% growth. We have now fully lapped the negative impacts associated with U.S. debit regulation. Through July 21, process transaction growth was a positive 14%. Lastly, please note that in our operational performance data pack, that was released with today's earnings results, we updated the cash volume in our LAC region to account for several quarters of underreporting by one of our largest issuers in Brazil. As a reminder, these cash volumes have no impact to our revenue. Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, a 17% increase year-over-year driven by solid growth globally in both domestic and international transactions and as mentioned earlier, aided by significant non-recurring incentives in the prior-year quarter. Currency hedging resulted in only a modest foreign exchange headwind on net revenue in the quarter. Looking ahead, after factoring in our hedging program, we anticipate continued headwinds in the next fiscal quarter and for fiscal 2014. Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 7% over the prior-year period. On a sequential basis, growth was negatively impacted by the Chase agreement which as I previously outlined, resulted in lower service revenue offset by a lower level of incentives paid to Chase. Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa, process transactions inside and outside the U.S. and strong cyber storage transaction growth. With the full lapping of the implementation of U.S. Debit Regulation, data processing revenue growth is now relatively on par with process transaction growth. International transaction revenue was up 14% to $854 million reflecting solid strength in cross-border volume and some modest benefit from higher currency volatility. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives as a percentage of gross revenue for the quarter came in at 14.8%, positively impacted by the Chase deal. That said, we anticipate a meaningful step-up in both incentive dollars and the percentage rate in Q4 due to anticipated deal activity both domestic and international which should put us within our 2013 guidance range of 16% to 17%.  Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year adjusted results. This was primarily due to higher costs associated with investments in our growth strategy.  Marketing expenses were up 4% from the prior year and stepped up from the prior quarter as we increased marketing to support a number of sponsorship campaigns including the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in South America and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.  Operating margin for the quarter was 61% and is consistent with our current guidance. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 33.2% while higher than our full year guidance of 30% to 32%, the year-to-date figure of 31% is tracking to that range.  Net income at $1.2 billion was up 16% over the prior year adjusted results. Fully diluted EPS was $1.88 for the quarter, up 20% over prior year adjusted results. Stronger than anticipated revenue and more aggressive share repurchases were key drivers and as noted earlier our full year adjusted EPS guidance is now low 20s.  Capital expenditures $122 million in the quarter and continue to be in line with our full-year expectations. At the end of the June quarter, we had 645 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on a S converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the June quarter totaled 651 million.  Finally, in terms of guidance, other than our refinement of full-year 2013 revenue guidance to around 13%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth to the low 20s, all other outstanding guidance metrics for the full-year fiscal 2013 and 2014 remain the same.  And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie. \nCharlie Scharf:  Thank you, Byron, and good afternoon everyone. First of all, I just want to reiterate that we feel very good about our performance this quarter. There is very little new news in the underlining revenue trends as Byron has just described, which means that we continue to see broad based growth geographically and also by product. And these are at growth rates consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters.  People often ask us about what we see in the economy and what I guess we can say is we don\u2019t see meaningful changes to the path of the economic recovery. And while accelerating and certainly a more broad based recovery would be beneficial to us and our clients, we do continue to feel very good about our business and our ability to deliver strong results in the current economic environment.  We did host our Investor Day on June 6th and I want to thank all those who attended both physically and listened in. we know it was a lengthy call but hopefully you found it productive. We certainly appreciate all the feedback that we received. Just a couple of quick reminders of some of these important themes that we covered.  First of all, you know, we feel great about the strong foundation that this company has been built on. There has been strong historical growth. We have great partners and the company has a tradition of innovation. Second, the macro trends have and will continue to provide tailwinds. The opportunity to move transactions from cash to electronic means is still huge. And we believe we\u2019ll be there for years to come. This is true in both the developed and the developing parts of the world. As you pointed out on Investor Day, we have 22% share TCE in the emerging, I\u2019m sorry, within the developed markets and 9% in the emerging markets. So there is still much room to grow. In addition to us growing along with the growth of TCE across the world. We love our core network. It\u2019s served us well and think it provides us tremendous opportunities to leverage and grow our business. Historically, what\u2019s really benefited us has been the global acceptance, the network reliability, safe and security and soundness, and our risk related tools are just a huge value added component to the network. While we continue to build on these historical strengths as we pointed out at the Investor Day, the future for us will be about using the network is a tool, to continue to create more value for issuers, acquires and merchants, and that include us building broader capabilities but also giving them access, it\u2019s our network as a device that connects to them together. Third, the company has and continued to make huge investments in the future. We walk through some of the additional spending that\u2019s been done to the tune of an additional $700 million versus prior years, which are for the most part all geared towards growth opportunities. And lastly, we talk about our evolving rules and practices, recognizing how the payments world is evolving. We recognize the needs to evolve our company. But we also feel strongly that we need to continue to preserve some core principles, those include the importance of the Visa brand, the safety, security and soundness of the payment system that we continue to protect and control our intellectual property, and that we enable clients of all sizes to compete. So in short, these of things that while we think we can continue to do more and more for all of our clients we think these things could also add value to the Visa network. We turn now to little bit of an update on some of the regulatory and litigation items that are both been in the news and we\u2019ve spoken about. First of all in the United States on the MDL case. The deadline for the opt outs was May 28th. As expected I am sure you show lawsuits that were filed against Visa, MasterCard and in some cases the banks from retailers which opted out of the merchant settlement agreement last year. The final figures are still being calculated but our estimate of the opt out is that they represent slightly above 25% of our U.S. credit volume. We continue to expect approval from a core sometime in the fall. I do want to stress that these are proceedings that have been on going for a long period of time. We remain committed to figuring out how to work with merchants of all sizes to resolve all of our differences amicably and we as you heard from us we are focused on finding new ways to work with them in conjunction with acquires and issuers to support all of the individual constituents growth objectives. Secondly, Canada, yesterday Canada\u2019s competition tribunal issue this decision to dismiss the competition bureau\u2019s case and uphold our no surcharge and Honour All Cards rule. We have and we\u2019ll continue to engage with legislators and regulators around the world to promote the understanding of a value of electronic payments to consumers, merchant and governments broadly. Let me now turn to Europe, and as a reminder, Visa Inc. and Visa Europe are separate independent operating companies. First of all, let me talk about, in May we alerted you to a European Commission inquiry by the Director of General Competition related to inter-regional credit interchange rates. That investigation specifically relates to the interchange applied to transactions between a non-European Union cardholder and the merchant located within the European Union. We continue to assess their claims and we are working in a productive and professional manager with them and hope to reach resolution but there is nothing more to report at this time. Separately, the European Commission earlier today released proposed legislation for the payments industry in the European Union which had been expected. The proposed regulation covers a wide range of topics related to the European payments industry including domestic and intra-EU cross-border interchange rates, [co-batching] requirements, process requirements and point-of-sale rules such as Honour All Cards. Most recent announcement submission appears to address issues similar to the Commission competition case, but the propose regulation would only applied to transactions when the issuer and an acquirer are located in the European Union. We understand that proposed legislation is to beginning of what we expect could be a long process which could take 18 to 24 months. We\u2019ll continue to keep you updated if we learn of any more developments in either these two proceedings. Also in Europe, I\u2019m sure we would get a question about the Visa Europe put and there is no update on that. Let me move now and just talk for a second about a topic which has lot of you are writing about and has gotten a lot of press and that\u2019s tokenization. And to start with, stating the obvious which is we all know that transactions are increasingly moving to digital card, not present channels due to the growth of web commerce, mobile and digital wallet.  As you\u2019ve heard from us in the past we\u2019ve been building our capabilities to deal with transactions like this both technically and through our rules and requirements, V.net and CyberSource are just two examples where we\u2019ve made significant investments to build capabilities in this space. And as we talk about tokenization I do want to just make a point that tokenization is not a new concept to us. Historically, we define the 16-digit account number [method] set and we effectively operate as tokens in the payment system today.  The reality is the development of digital commerce and related risks makes the evolution of these existing tokens -- the evolution of these existing tokens to a more secure form very necessary in a way that works both in the physical and the digital worlds. We need to eliminate the flow of sensitive data that might be vulnerable to a breach and new entrance into the payment ecosystem has also brought into question whether the appropriate information will continue to flow between merchant, acquirer, issuer and consumer. And rightly so, the entire payments industry is focused on this.  You read earlier this month about efforts that the Clearinghouse has underway with its 22 U.S. banks to do some work on this topic as well. We believe that we play a critical role in helping define the standards for token implementation broadly. We're working closely across the entire payment ecosystem defined very broadly to do this. This is an area where everyone needs to work closely together and it\u2019s paramount that we ensure transparency, security, and integrity so that the integrity of the payment system remains. Successful tokenization initiatives must also be interoperable and standardized and do several very important things.  Number one is they need to deliver value to all stakeholders, that includes issuers, consumers, merchants, acquirers, payment gateways, and everyone involved in the digital commerce platform. It\u2019s got to be standards based, technology agnostic such that a tokenization solution builds on the existing open nature of the payments industry while also aligning with emerging payment innovation systems mobile and digital wallets. As I said before, it needs to deliver at least the same level as transparency and reliability that exists today. And equally important it needs to address the needs of everyone globally, not just in the United States.  As I said before, we're committed to working on this broadly with all of our partners. it\u2019s something that we are working on and we feel very good about the progress that we're making with our partners on this one.  In conclusion, I just want to also talk about the repurchase program that Byron mentioned. It\u2019s the ninth share repurchase program that the Company has authorized, since the IPO, our Board of Directors has authorized over 11 billion in share repurchase programs. And as we\u2019ve talked about I think almost on every call and at the Investor Day since I\u2019ve joined, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders both through repurchase programs like this as well as further dividend increases. So, you know, having been here for nine months, as I commented at Investor Day, I remain more bullish as each day goes on when we look at the opportunities that exist in the industry and the assets and the ideas and the people that we have at Visa. So with that, operator, Byron and I are ready to take any questions that are out there. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is open. \nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust:  Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Charlie, could you speak broadly about Visa\u2019s U.S. consumer credit share and how you feel you\u2019re positioned to expand share and continue above trend line growth especially as some of your competitors are potentially sharpening the pencil a little bit in the U.S.?\nCharlie Scharf:  Sure. Listen, I think, we are blessed with just an outstanding U.S. credit franchise which has been build up through the years through terrific relationships for sure. We look at the partners that we have and look at their performance and certainly our performance has been helped by their strong performance and that\u2019s\u2019 true both on the issuer side, as well as on the co-brand side. We\u2019ve also been certainly beneficiaries in the United States credit market as the affluent customer has recovered more quickly than the non-affluent customers and as we look forward more broad-based recovery is something which should be additive to the affluent business that we have today. Ultimately, our ability to compete as effectively as we have within the United States revolves around all other things that we've been talking about here that we know we need to continue to build out. Those include what we are doing in the digital space. They include what we are doing in the mobile space, as well as just the continuing to provide the flexibility that we\u2019ve talked about in terms of our core product set. So listen and I know from the prior roles that I played, the market has always been a competitive one. There always been networks out there competing for the same business. The pencil have been sharped for a period of time and as we think about what we've got to do going forward, we certainly expect that to continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin - RBC: Thanks. I\u2019m just interested to know, how important, local market processing through, DPS and VPS is you guys, from a long-term growth perspective, it does represent an important enhancement to the yield as you\u2019ve talked about, you highlighted at the Analyst Day and it seems to be kind of coming up, with some pros and cons in various economies as you kind of outlined in your prepared remark. So if you could just speak to that point, I would appreciate it? Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf: Yeah. Listen, I mean, as we talked about at Investor Day, processing we think is the second part of the equation that we can provide for our customers. When we process the transaction, when press -- when the transaction goes over our network, we are enable to, that give us the opportunity to do all things that we can do, both from a risk perspective, as well as being able to provide all the analytical information that we can provided back to the issuers in order for them to help grow their business.\nByron Pollitt: And I would just add the more of the, the more we integrate into the processing pipeline. The -- we have an opportunity to differentiate our service offering. So in the case of DPS, this creates an opportunity for us to introduce more innovative product services via mobile as an example and to add to phone trackers that expand the activation capability or opportunity for our clients. So where we can provide processing services like DPS which have the single larges debit scale potentially outside of China, I suppose. This is an area where we can excel in delivering client service.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nDon Fandetti - Citigroup: Yeah. Charlie, I\u2019m just curious if there are any updates on the Visa-Chase network deal in terms of timing. I think it was, there was going to be some type of pilot or something by the end of year and then also, I was wondering if you have any sense on the scope of that initiative, will it just be for merchants or transactions that are acquired through payment tackle that be broaden to other merchants indirectly?\nCharlie Scharf: Okay. So, on the first part of the question, I continue to say this, which is, when it comes to what Chase merchant service is doing, there are series of questions that, you need to ask them about. What we are doing is providing the capabilities that we outlined several quarters ago. We are on schedule to deliver the ability for CMS to be in the marketplace by the fourth quarter. What actually winds up in the marketplace is really driven by them through their discussions with merchants. And again so that, that\u2019s a question for them.  And the agreement holds that they need to have a direct relationship with a merchant in order to take advantage of whatever it is they intend to provide through CMS. And so, you know as I\u2019ve said I would, I would expect that sometimes as we get into next year that we would start to see some things in the marketplace and at that point we\u2019ll all be in a position to evaluate what we think the benefit of the mark. \nOperator:  Our next question will come from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Your line is open. \nChris Brendler - Stifel:  Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you would give us an update on V.me specifically on merchant acceptance. It seems from my perspective that I haven\u2019t seen as broader acceptance as I would expect at this point. I think you had some concrete goals for top hundred retailers by the end of this year. Is there an acceleration coming? What\u2019s the issue? Is it difficult to get merchants to add V.me and then along those lines, MCX, is this something that you think potentially as a competitor threat. It seems to be gaining a little bit of momentum? And is V.me a key part of your strategy in combatting merchant mobile wallets? Thanks. \nCharlie Scharf: Let me start with V.me. You know I guess when we talk about V.me, you can\u2019t, and it\u2019s hard to separate out how we're doing with this issuers versus how we're doing with merchants because in our discussions with each, we really need to have to grow both sides in order to be successful. Right, it\u2019s the chicken and the egg which is, you know, merchants aren\u2019t going to want to spend the time and the effort and the money to establish V.me on their site unless they think there is a real need for it. And the issuers are going to be careful about marketing it to their clients until there is a meaningful amount of acceptance.  Having said that, we now have about 90 U.S. national institutions as partners. they include BofA, PNC, BBBA, ICBA, and others. And some of those have started actively to market these programs. We have signed an additional 72 merchants this past quarter, bringing the total signed number of merchants to 253, many, many of which will go live in the coming weeks and months. So there is a lot more coming here. There is, you know, a fairly significant pipeline of merchants. As we continue to work with acquirers on this to get in the marketplace, we\u2019ll report back.  And MCX was the second question. Listen, I think MCX we know what you know about MCX which is, you know you might know more than us. So, you know, our view on MCX is that we will learn as they continue to disclose what it is they're doing and we're focused on doing what we can to build the right kind of tools to work with merchants so that they want to do business with us. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.  \nTien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan:  Great. Thanks. That sounds pretty clean. I guess I\u2019d just ask about U.S. debit growth. That did bounce back nicely to 12%. Let's just look at the 10-Q. It says intra-link process transactions were up 25%. I notice it running down pretty sharply so that was a pretty big step up. I\u2019m curious is that sustainable and what\u2019s driving it? Did you clip on some new cars or is that paid, any details that would be great. Thanks. \nByron Pollitt:  Now, Tien-Tsin, remember we're lapping the implementation of the Dodd-Frank, not suppose to say Durbin anymore, Dodd-Frank rules which took effect April 1st of last year. So it was in that quarter that we experienced the single largest negative growth rate in terms of intra-link volume. In fact, it was a 54% reduction in payment volume growth in the June ending quarter 2012 and then in the coming quarters as our strategies began to gradually take hold, we started to see a less negative growth rate. So one could deduce from that that in terms of actual year-over-year growth rate, it\u2019s considerable that the -- this June ending quarter might be high tide and then as we begin to lap the other quarters, the subsequent quarters that the relative growth will just have a tougher comp to deliver. I\u2019d also just like to underscore that there is no way we\u2019re going to recover all that market share that we have considered as a result of the legislative change. So I think that there will be -- we still need a few more quarters in order to get to some sort of normalized state. But as I said in my earnings commentary, in the subsequent quarters we still expect healthy growth rates in debit, U.S. debit. But everything else being equal they should moderate a bit as they begin to lap the strategies we put into place which in turn had growing effectiveness as time pass.\nByron Pollitt: Let me just add to that. So the follow up is we still think we have from our perspective a business, which can grow at a reasonable rate, understanding that we believe we permanently lost share because of legislation and those two things can coexist.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nGlenn Greene - Oppenheimer: Thank you. Just regarding the EU proposal, I wanted to just get some context from you regarding whether or not it\u2019s having any bearings on your discussions with Visa Europe regarding their potential to exercise the put, as well as negotiation of these specific terms, meaning is this then somewhat of a stumbling back -- stumbling block getting clarity on the EU proposal?\nCharlie Scharf: I think you\u2019ve got to ask, Visa Europe has a put. So, that means, we don\u2019t have a call and we it\u2019s -- and we can\u2019t proactively engage them in a discussion on price or things like that. So what impacts their thinking relative to their desire to put the company, you really have to ask them. I mean I think it\u2019s a complicated set of circumstances. There is a lot going on in Europe right now. I think you can make arguments either way, whether it makes -- if you\u2019re sitting in their position, whether it would make you more willing or less willing, but it\u2019s their decision. So they\u2019re the appropriate people to answer the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.\nCraig Maurer - CLSA: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two question. First, could you comment on China? There seems to be some movement in terms of issuers being allowed to issue cards in China. Some discussion regarding processing, I\u2019m just wondering if you could discuss there\u2019s been any sign of those discussions or your thought process around timing of when the market might become open to you? Secondly, on incentives, like so you\u2019ve got two quarters of benefit from the Chase field in this quarter, I believe this what you said. But looking out to next year, is it reasonable to believe that you could come in as a percentage of gross revenue below the bottom end of this year\u2019s guidance due to the new arrangement or are other clients increasing and therefore that\u2019s a false assumption? Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf: Why don\u2019t I start with China and unfortunately there\u2019s still not a lot of new news to talk about with China. The agreement with the WTO requires China to issue regulations by the end of July to open up the domestic market to foreign competition. From what we\u2019ve seen, there has been some very small incremental things announced by the Chinese government but they have not been clear as we read the information to lay out a roadmap to open up the domestic marketplace. So we're waiting with everyone else until that happens. We have no better idea than anyone else, how, what form that will take, what time period. The opportunity for us, in what time period that opportunity would evolve. And so, you know, there is not a lot there.  Now having said that we're still in the same place with, we feel, from a long term perspective, putting aside whether it\u2019s, one quarter, four quarters or eight quarters away, the opportunity to compete in a domestic marketplace in China with the capabilities that we have, we think could be significant over a long period of time. Unfortunately we still don\u2019t know what the time period is and what the requirements to participate will be. \nByron Pollitt: Over to incentive.\nCharlie Scharf: You asked an interesting question. There is clearly two forces at work here. One of which is the Chase contract where the pricing has been restructured so that it is more per transaction. There is still incentives related to the contract but not nearly at the magnitude that they were pre contract. At the same time, the vast majority of our issuers are in growth mode with their portfolios. The larger they grow their portfolios, the more incentives we pay. And that has been our business model for decades.  And so, as is our practice, we will schedule those out over the next coming, the next two months. We will also take a hard look at what contracts are likely to renew in the coming year, which also raise into that copulation and then give you a report out in October. Let me just signal in the spirit of your question, that it\u2019s best, in our view, it is best to model incentives on a full-year basis recognizing that they can have a lot of variation between quarters and as I said in my earnings remarks, in Q4 we expect an above average level of deal activity as we move to the closing out of our fiscal year. And therefore we expect a higher percent as a -- incentive as a percent of gross revenue. And you should not consider that representative of the go forward trend. \nOperator:  Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan of Janney. Your line is open. \nTom McCrohan - Janney:  Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just a quick question on card not present (CNP) given the growth of the eCommerce, how much Visa\u2019s volume today is card not present eCommerce volume and is the revenue yield on those type of transactions the same as for transactions that are card present? Thanks. \nCharlie Scharf:  Good question. That\u2019s not something that we're, that we have decided to speak about publicly at this point. Inevitably though I think that\u2019s something that we will be talking about much more in the future since that is the fastest growing channel that we have and by way of form factor within Form Factor, the fastest growing factor is mobile. And the two of them clearly are linked. So I would say we're short on detail today but more to come in the future. \nOperator:  Our next question will come from Moshe Katri of Cowen. Your line is open. \nMoshe Katri - Cowen:  Okay, thanks. Byron can you talk a bit about credit in the U.S., maybe compare what you\u2019re seeing on the corporate side versus on the consumer side of the business and if there\u2019re any changes during the quarter? \nByron Pollitt: I would say that the, in terms of health, the corporate side is healthy but the factors that are fueling the really strong performance we\u2019ve been experiencing in consumer credit constitute more of a tailwind. When we look across the corporate spend, a lot of that has to do with the degree of recovery in the economies, across the globe. Our view is that the recovery, this is a technical term, is sluggish, which is one step above anemic and given that enthusiastic description, the very fact that we are seeing positive growth in corporate spend on cards in categories like airlines and the T&E components, we view as encouraging. Having said that, there is for us in our view a significant opportunity to further penetrate a commercial sector, we have invested significantly in our commercial information platforms that support that part of the business with our commercial clients. And we believe with the investments we\u2019ve made in our IntelliLink platform that we are well positioned to experience meaningful growth in this market segment in years to come.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Arvind Ramani of BNP. Your line is open.\nArvind Ramani - BNP: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Good quarter. I just had a quick question on your -- clearly the affluent has kind of -- has come back. But what are your assumptions for continued growth from the affluent market and also what\u2019s your view on the non-affluent market?\nCharlie Scharf: So the affluent part of our portfolio really has been the driver of the credit spend that we have been recording over the past year. In the last quarter or two, we are starting to see some participation from the next income cohort down but it is not yet significant and therefore it\u2019s not a material driver in our results today. As we look out into the coming year, when I describe the economic -- underlying economic growth as sluggish, if I would relate that to the U.S., creating 200,000 jobs a month, which is kind of the minimum to make any progress against unemployment. We would describe that as non-anemic but as sluggish growth. And -- but it is creating new jobs and those new jobs ultimately translate into spend. And so our outlook is that the non-affluent spend will contribute more but not significantly more to the payment volume spend in the coming year. That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. And when we gave our guidance for \u201814, the limited guidance at this point, that was the assumptions that underpinned the growth rates we expressed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Smittipon Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSmittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you. International revenue growth was strong in relation to cross border volume growth. Can you talk about the drivers behind that and how much of the lift that you guys get from makeshift toward the tighter yielding geographies?\nByron Pollitt: Yeah. So I would say that there is a little bit of mix. There is a lot of volatility. So whenever there is significant volatility in the currency markets that translates into higher international revenue for us. That\u2019s something that can be -- can appear in one quarter and disappear the next relative to whatever an average volatility is. We have been seeing with the strengthening of the dollar, the volatility in the Australian dollar, Japanese Yen to a lesser extent to Euro and Sterling, the turbulence in those markets is really -- and the associated volatility is the principal driver of the difference in international revenue versus the actual number of -- versus the growth in payment volume that we experienced.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Your line is open.\nRod Bourgeois - Bernstein: Okay. Great. Just a two-part question about Europe. So if you were a network impeding in the vast majority of Europe, what do you like and not like about the EC\u2019s regulatory proposals that have recently been released. And do, the second part of the question is, is there any worry that Europe\u2019s regulatory moves might fuel merchants to push for regulation in other countries such as the U.S. and/or emerging countries?  \nCharlie Scharf: Yeah, this is our view, if we were Europeans which we are certainly not, I guess when we read it the things that we like about it are I guess first of all there is recognition in the value of interchange. We can argue about what that number is but we\u2019ve heard lots of things through the years about whether interchange should exist or not exist in some parts of the world and recognition that it belongs, it\u2019s a statement in itself. And certainly I put no surcharge into that category as well. And, well then I would say which straddles both sides, the good and the bad, is level playing field. And so our networks that operate both three party and four party models fall into both sides of the camp. So on the one hand, it\u2019s a positive thing to bring some parts of their business into this level playing field. But the fact is there is still a meaningful part of the marketplace that there is just, you can argue an unfair advantage has been given and doesn\u2019t actually solve whatever the underlining regs are supposed to solve.  The second thing I would put in the negative category is [co-bashing] and the third thing I would put is this, the splitting of processing from the brand. And the second part of Rob\u2019s question was \u2026\nByron Pollitt:  (Inaudible) is reasonable.\nCharlie Scharf: Yeah and so I think it is the whole world, you know the world is a big place, but everyone sees what everyone else does, for sure. Everyone, so people will see what happened here in the U.S. on debit. We\u2019ve seen Australia. They\u2019ve been watching Canada. They\u2019ve been watching Europe. So it\u2019s certainly, you know you have to believe that when one significant part of the world does something that the other part of the world looks at it. You know in this case, you know remember this is proposed legislation. It will take several years for comments and for it to work through its process. So the things that have been decided here as best I can tell are not set in stone. And we\u2019ll see how these things actually evolve in the marketplace. \nOperator:  Our next question will come from Dave Koning from Baird.\nDave Koning - Baird:  Yeah, hey guys. Just looking at the 10-Q, rest of world revenue, not just the international line but actual rest of world revenue is up 24% this quarter. The last four it was up about 10% to 14%. And I think the explanation is some FX volatility probably helped on cross border part of that but it was a pretty big acceleration, maybe you can talk through maybe a couple of other reasons that that also accelerated so much. \nByron Pollitt: There are two reasons that matter. You hit the first one which is the boost in international is reflective. We booked that into the rest of world line. and the second, if you recall, when I mentioned that the 17% revenue growth for the quarter benefited from significant non-recurring incentives that brought the growth rate down by several percentage points if you were to exclude those. All of those significant nonrecurring incentives were outside the United States. So they had the effect of amplifying the growth rate of rest of world. And those are the two main drivers. \nOperator: \n.:\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna: Hi, a quick question on EMV. It looks like we're about 18 months from the deadline set in 2015. Are you seeing banks accelerate the issuance of EMV cards ahead of the deadline and any comments on EMV with regards to merchant acceptance would be interesting. Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf: We certainly hear a fair amount being discussed about it. And we also have, I think, more issuers in the United States issuing Chip Cards due to the importance of making for an easy acceptance experience when people travel outside the United States. I don\u2019t have the numbers in terms of the amount of EMV cards that are being issued today. It is bigger than it\u2019s been but it\u2019s not, by any stretch, imagination of the majority of the cards yet. But I did read something recently that suggested that the percentage of issuers that are attending to do it is growing but I don\u2019t think we know any more than that today. And on the merchant side, I would say it\u2019s a similar conversation with the exception being to the extent that machines in merchant\u2019s facilities have to be replaced. They appear to be being replaced with machines that will accept the new form of card.\nJack Carsky: Brad, at this point, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller - Barclays: Thanks guys. Just want to jump in year-to-date we\u2019re clearly seeing a more meaningful margin expansion for this year again versus what we saw in the prior year, really prior to average margins. Average margins to the first three quarters are around 62.5%. So really more than 100 basis points expansion year-over-year. Is there anything unique about the years, quarterly revenues or maybe the operating leverage in the model on the past quarter is that shouldn\u2019t appear as there is something that we can expect this type of margin upside just from thorough operating leverage embedded in the model?\nByron Pollitt: Let me respond to that in two ways. First of all, I just want to anchor the group back into the guidance for \u201813 since we are talking margins and you begin with year-to-date. So we held our guidance at around 60% operating margin, which implies -- the math implies that the year-to-date is trending higher than what we would expect for the fourth quarter, which is why we kept it at around 60, so point one. Point two, there is fundamental operating leverage in the business as you know. We have been very consistent in that we don't solve for operating margins. We don\u2019t have targets. We don't have internal requirements, what we do solve for our investments that drive shareholder value. It is the nature of our business that many of those investments are expense versus capital. And therefore as we continue to ramp up the investments that support our growth strategies, it is -- they often carry a significant expense component to them and would immediately put down downward pressure on the margins. And I think it's safe to say that that philosophy of investing for growth and value both today and tomorrow is the philosophy we intend to follow. And that is -- that means some sacrifices of theoretically higher-margin, we\u2019re fully prepared to do that in the name of shareholder value.\nCharlie Scharf: And let me just add one more thing to that which is, as it has been pointed out by bunch of you and also on this call, we do operate in a competitive marketplace. And it wouldn\u2019t be right for our long-term shareholder interest to be thinking about how our services should be priced based upon a commitment that we would make to you all to continue to increase the margin levels that we have. We have to look at each transaction. How does the market price those transactions, what value do we think we\u2019re providing and have the ability to compete effectively if we think it makes sense. And so that August factored into the guidance that\u2019s given.\nJack Carsky: With that, we want to thank you all for joining us here today and if anybody has follow-up questions, please feel free to call investor relations. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation on the conference call today.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website. With that, and in contrast to what\u2019s been a historical pattern, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Byron.\nByron H. Pollitt: Thank you, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, Visa\u2019s 15% net revenue growth in fiscal second quarter was once again broad based as we continue to see strong credit and debit growth in the U.S. and the Rest of World, which is now supported by a return to positive growth in our aggregate U.S. debit business. Second, client incentives for the quarter. As a percentage of gross revenue, we\u2019re 16.1%. Similar to last quarter, this was a result of lower than expected deal activity. However, for the balance of fiscal 2013, we expect lower incentive levels than originally projected. The new 10-year deal structure with Chase has the effect of simultaneously reducing both gross fees and revenue incentives with one largely offsetting the other. This contractual change which is now signed and in effect in combination with the timing and revenue mix have caused us to lower our full year client incentive outlook from 18% to 18.5% down to 16% to 17% for fiscal 2013. Third, aggregate U.S. debit payment volume growth turned positive in the fiscal second quarter of 2013 versus a negative 3% in the fiscal first quarter. Of note, the month of March saw the onset of a significant positive inflection point as we lapped last year's adoption of the Dodd-Frank routing rules for U.S. debit. While interlink payment volume growth was in negative mid-teen territory, Visa debit payment volumes saw a 12% rate of growth. Fourth, as a result of a more certain revenue outlook and earlier than planned share repurchases, we are increasing our fiscal 2013 EPS guidance from high teens to around 20%. Lastly, as we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders and through this end during the quarter, we spent $1.8 billion to repurchase 12 million shares at an average price of $157. This means through the first two fiscal quarters, we have spent 3.1 billion to repurchase 20 million shares at an average price of $152. As we begin the fiscal third quarter, our remaining open to buy stands at $1 billion. Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the fiscal second quarter followed by our results through April 28th. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2013. The payment volume growth rates which follow are unadjusted for the leap year in 2012. Normalizing the month of February would add about 1 percentage point of growth to the second quarter's results. Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 9%, on par with the December quarter's 9%. This was driven by a sustained growth in all of our regions, including the U.S. We saw some incremental benefit from the early lapping effects associated with U.S. debit regulations. More recently in the U.S. through April 28, payment volume growth was 12% compared with 4% in the March ending quarter. U.S. credit growth held at Q2 levels while debit experienced improved growth rates. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 10% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter, which compares to 11% rate in the December quarter. The U.S. grew 9% and the rest of world 11%. Through April 28, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 10% with the U.S. growth rate of 7% and the rest of world at 12%. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13.9 billion in the fiscal second quarter, a 6% increase over the prior-year period. U.S. saw a 3% increase in transactions while the rest of world delivered 21% growth. Through April 28, processed transaction growth was a positive 15%, driven in part by the lapping of the U.S. debit routing regulations. Separately, CyberSource reported 1.6 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year. Turning to the income statement; net operating revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year driven by solid growth in global payment volumes, data processing revenues, international revenues, and as mentioned earlier lower than anticipated client incentives. Hedging resulted in no meaningful foreign exchange impact on that revenue in the quarter. Moving to the individual revenue line items; service revenue was $1.4 billion up 10% over the prior-year period. Revenue growth was in line with constant dollar payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion up 25% over the prior-year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions inside and outside the U.S., strong CyberSource transaction growth as well as strategic pricing actions taken last year related to the restructuring of our pricing in the U.S. debit market. International transaction revenue was up 13% to $831 million reflecting solid strength in cross-border volumes. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives as a percentage of growth to revenue for the quarter came in at 16.1% lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to the timing of deals in the quarter. Looking forward the change in pricing structure related to the Chase contract in combination with deal timing and revenue mix now suggest full-year client incentives in the 16% to 17% range. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion up 13% from the prior-year. This was primarily due to higher costs associated with investments in our growth strategies. The rate of operating expense growth should slow in the second half. Marketing expenses were up 15% primarily due to a low-spend level in the prior-year largely related to the timing of the London Summer Olympics. Spend will step up in the fiscal third and fourth quarters as we increase marketing to support a number of campaigns including the FIFA Confederations Cup in South America. Operating margin for the quarter was 63%, well slightly ahead of our full-year guidance of about 60% this margin level is consistent with how we plan for the year. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 31.6% and it's fully consistent with our full-year guidance of 30% to 32%. Net income at $1.3 billion was up 17% over prior-year adjusted results. Fully diluted EPS was $1.92 for the quarter up 20% over prior-year adjusted results due in part to a strong commitment to return excess cash in the form of share repurchase. As noted earlier our full-year adjusted EPS guidance is now around 20%. Finally capital expenditures were $111 million in the quarter and continued to be in line with our full-year expectations. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fiscal second quarter totaled $660 million. Other than the changes to our client incentives and diluted earnings per share growth all other outstanding guidance remains the same. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to, Charlie.\nCharles W. Scharf: Thanks, Byron and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re happy with our continued strong performance and as Byron walked us through it was a strong growth across the world. Economic uncertainty does remain but our business model continues to prove itself through own environments and growth rates as Byron had mentioned have continued through April which makes us feel quite good. We continue to build on some exciting partnerships around the world both traditional and involving emerging technologies. Just a few important examples of these I want to mention. We executed a multi-year co-brand renewal with South West Airlines one of our largest co-brands in the United States. We have talked about V.me before. We now have 82 U.S. issuers who have agreed to participate. We have more than 180 merchants signed, 20 of which are top 100 internet retailers and there are 37 merchants live today and more coming online as we talk. During the quarter we also announced a broad based partnership agreement with Samsung covering Visa\u2019s payment capabilities on Samsung devices. Samsung phones will be preloaded with Visa payWave for contactless payments and the Visa Mobile Provisioning Service to securely download payment account information to NFC-enabled Samsung devices. These are just a couple of examples of some of the most important things that we executed in the quarter. I want to turn and talk for a second about Europe. There's been a lot of discussion about a couple of items, so we thought we would walk through each of these one by one. First of all, let's just talk about our relationship with Visa Europe and the put. I guess I would say is we've read when you've read. We do not know what they'll do. And just as a reminder, they have a put, so it's their decision. We do not have a call. The way we think about it, they have three options relative to our relationship. They can keep our relationship as is, they can exercise the put or they can propose an alternative which is different from the put. If they choose to exercise the put, there's a clearly defined process for that. If they were to propose something other than the put, we would consider it and if still inclined, we would negotiate it in normal course. But the process of the put would not apply. It was clear when I got here that we're always prepared if they choose to exercise the put to go through the process and have our points of view on that. Having said all that, we believe that we compete effectively now but there is certainly a clear benefit over the long term to be one company, and I've talked about that before. I think it's true both for Visa Inc. as well as for Europe, but they need to come to that conclusion themselves. But I think most importantly in all of this is we're prepared to compete regardless of the structure, regardless of which avenue they go down. And if the situation changes, we'll obviously report back, but as of now what you read are the facts I believe. The second issue is the EC enquiry. They are investigating intra-European credit interchange rates and inter-regional credit interchange rates, which is where a non-European cardholder uses their card within Europe. They're also investigating certain MasterCard rates as well. If the EC ultimately challenges Visa and MasterCard's conduct, we expect that would seek to prohibit Visa and MasterCard from setting default inter-regional interchange rates at their current levels. In addition, the EC is investigating Honor All Cards, no surcharge rules, as well as the practice of blending merchant fees. We're in discussions with the EC and have nothing to report yet. There is a disagreement to the extent Visa Europe has an obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. on this issue. We're confident in our position that Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. and we're engaged in conversations with them to resolve the matter. Let me move and just quickly cover two regulatory and litigation items that you're all aware of. The first one is the MDL. The deadline for the opt outs is May 28 and we're confident that the judge will approve the settlement. On the Department of Justice, there is no update. We remain comfortable. Our actions are appropriate. Let me move on now and just talking back to last quarter's earnings call. On that call, I talked about our need to become more flexible and the need to work more closely with merchants, and I'm going to talk a little bit more about this. Just a reminder, as we think about our opportunity we believe the number one opportunity for us is to move transactions from cash onto our electronic platform. And we're confident that RSFs are of the quality and the scope that we believe we would get our fair share of transactions in the process. This really is about moving transactions away from cash. Our focus is on helping issuers remain competitive at the point-of-sale. The ecosystem is evolving and we need to evolve as well to make sure we remain competitive at that point. So to that end, we're evolving our rules. We also aggressively continue to invest in new capabilities that we think will benefit everyone in the payments value chain. And a court example of this was effective February 1st we modified one of our rules to enable issuers and merchants to differentiate at the point-of-sale. This could take form in a whole series of things, but it could include things such as discount, offers or incentive. We like this change because it creates an environment where all four parties, consumers, issuers, acquirers and merchants now have the ability to work together to create their most \u2013 the most robust experience for all and all four parties will now be able to work together to use on network to help us grow Visa payment volume and the role we hadn\u2019t placed did not allow that to happen. Lot of talk about the Chase contract and the Chase contract in reality is just one example of giving our issuers and acquirers an opportunity to create an environment to actually do what we just talked about, which is delivering more value to merchants and consumers. So we included a slide, but I thought I would walk through exactly just what it is. First of all, it's a 10-year renewable partnership. As part of this, we will create a distinct custom platform within VisaNet for the processing of their transactions, which I believe they are referring to is Chase Merchant Services or CMS. This image of Visa\u2019s authorization clearing and settlement system will license to them exclusively for their use. The Chase transactions will still originate from the Visa branded card, but will be processed in one or two ways. The first way, it will be \u2013 would be just as happens today. The second if the card is used to the merchant with whom Chase has a direct agreement for CMS, the transactions will be processed over the platform provided for them by us. Visa branding on the cards and at the point of sale remains the same. The CMS platform is customizable, but the transactions will continue to meet our safety, security and sound as standards and we can offer similar functionality to any other Visa client. Visa retains ownership and control of this technology and intellectual property which is obviously critical for us. Chase like any other issuer today can negotiate interchange directly with merchants, whether the transaction is processed from CMS or VisaNet. Not sure that this is well understood that it\u2019s \u2013 that issuers have the ability to do this today, but they do in fact have the ability to do it and Chase any of the merchants, we will continue to have the ability. The pricing levels and mechanics for our dealer Chase are consistent with what would be available; the clients have Chase their size and scope for making a 10-year commitment. And obviously important for us, we Visa will gain additional consumer credit and debit volume. Looking ahead, we will continue to develop new capabilities, enhancing our business practices because we want to help issuers, acquirers, and merchants of all sizes work more closely together to take full advantage of the opportunities emerging across the industries and to that end we are in active discussions with other partners on ways to use our network to help them differentiate. If clients are interested, we\u2019re willing to pursue customized arrangements that make sense to their own business needs. But we will adhere to certain core Visa principals which is the manner in which we had approached the Chase arrangement. Just a few of these would be, number one, is it would have to support the Visa brand. We\u2019d have to support our safety, soundness, and security standards that we maintain. We would have to make control \u2013 maintain control over the IP, we would have to continue to enable clients of all sizes to compete in the marketplace. And probably most importantly whatever we do, we\u2019d have to add value to the Visa network. The bottom line is we believe that what \u2013 that our approach here relative to Chase and our approach with all issuers, acquirers, merchants of all sizes, our steps that are good for the electronification of payments, good for all of our partners and therefore good for us. There is a lot more we can talk about, but we do have plans for you all, the complete strategic update at our Investor Day, scheduled for June 6. At that meeting we intend to cover plans for what we are doing both in the developed and the emerging economies and we intend to focus a lot on e-Commerce, mobile solutions, and what we're doing in the technology space in general. So, we will leave a bunch of the discussions for that and still we have plenty of time. And with that, I think we will stop and will open the call to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks. I think the \u2013 revenue performance obviously very strong. I was just wondering if you could kind of talk about how you see that progressing. Obviously, it sounds like the incentives that you were talking about was lower incentives in the current period, and so can we take away from that that you're actually seeing kind of better combination, if you will, of kind of volume coming out of debit and some of the pricing actions that you've taken?\nByron H. Pollitt: So let me respond to that. First, just to be clear on the incentive piece, a large contributor to the reduction in the incentive guidance going forward and to a certain extent this quarter, when we signed the Chase agreement it restructured how we price so that as I said in my opening remarks, gross fees are coming down along with incentives and it's largely an offset. So while incentives for the balance of the year are expected to come in, in that 16% to 17% range, that in and of itself is not a significant contributor to the revenue performance for the balance of the year because we haven't changed our overall revenue guidance. So we are well positioned within the low double-digit range. And what we're seeing underlying that is strong, sustained performance globally. And we're two quarters now under our belt. And because of our quarter lag, remember that we actually have visibility to three quarters of service revenue. We have a much higher degree of certainty of how the year will flow out. And given the strength we're seeing outside the U.S. had good sustained recovery in our U.S. debit business as you've pointed out, and particularly as we enter into the April, May, June quarter, this will anniversary the Dodd-Frank routing rules. Notice I said Dodd-Frank not Durbin. And so while the debit business in the U.S. has sustained a meaningful loss particularly in the interlink, we're pleased with the way our mitigation strategies have unfolded and the way the business has been recovering over the past several quarters.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.\nCraig Maurer - CLSA: Good evening. Quickly, I was wondering if you could address any material pricing differences between Visa Inc. and Visa Europe that would have to be overcome should the put be exercised. And although I know it doesn't materially impact your top line, I was wondering if you could just clarify what's going on with the cash volumes in Latin America that seem to be off dramatically? Thanks.\nByron H. Pollitt: The pricing approach that Visa Europe pursues is one that's still very much based on a bank-owned membership arrangement. And so it's different than what we have here in the United States for Visa and globally outside of Europe. Having said that, Visa Europe is still not priced to be competitive with other competitors like MasterCard in that arena, and so we've not done a detailed analysis of what the comparisons are, but there is a presumption that to be competitive you have to price competitively. And we consider Visa Europe very competitive in that part of the world. So don't really have a comment on that. And with regards to the cash volumes in Latin America, don't have a comment on that either. And so we'll \u2013 that's when we'll have to take a look into and we'd be happy to get back to you through IR.\nCharles W. Scharf: Let me just add to Byron's response on the Visa Europe question. As I said in the remarks, there's a very defined process that we would go through with Visa Europe where we look at the sustainable earnings power of the company. And I would presume a big part of that discussion would be what the sustainable revenue contribution would be as the model evolved and there is plenty of time throughout that process to have that discussion with them, if we get to that point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bill Carache of Nomura. Your line is open.\nBill Carache - Nomura: Thanks. Good evening. So between about $1.8 billion of buybacks and over $200 million in dividend, it looks like your payout ratio was about 160% this quarter there about. As we look ahead, with final approval of the merchant litigation, which we expect, influence your mindset or attitude regarding capital return, perhaps just making you feel like you have a bit more flexibility there?\nCharles W. Scharf: The answer is no. We have \u2013 we began life as a public company committed to return excess cash to shareholders. We have done that aggressively over five plus years. Every time that was an opportunity to in effect put money into the escrow on behalf of the U.S. bank shareholders. And do that in a way that it had the effect of share repurchase, we did that. Have that money not going into the escrow. I\u2019m fairly confident in saying that we\u2019d have ended up buying back in the open market, those shares. And just the final point, you mentioned the buyback and the dividends for the period. If we think about our commitment in the following way. I think there is underscores not our commitment to return. We have guided $6 billion of free cash flow for the year. Roughly one billion of that six will be generated in offshore in ways that we\u2019d not bring back to the U.S. and subjected to taxes at least at this \u2013 any time in the near future. That leaves $5 billion. We have authorization to repurchase a little over $4 billion for the year of which we have basically bought back through the first six months $3 billion of the $4 billion and if you take four full quarters of dividend payments, you\u2019re approaching a $1 billion. So if have the share repurchases and set forward to the dividends of one, you get $5 billion of the $6 billion of free cash flow, in effect return to shareholders in the $1 billion that isn\u2019t is offshore.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Thank you. I was hoping you could discuss this merchant litigation that\u2019s been threatened in Europe, that you guys disclosed in the 10-Q, it seems like you feel like you\u2019re being in \u2013 you should be indemnified there as well. But I was wondering if can just flush that out a little bit. I guess, was that the part of the reason that would drive the banks to exercise the point. And then second, I just want to make sure I understood Byron\u2019s point about the Chase. With the gross revenue yield then come down next quarter, given the structuring of the deal, because if you look at kind of the year-over-year change, those were up in the second quarter? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf: You want to answer the second one first Bryon?\nByron H. Pollitt: Yeah, let me do the second one first. Everything else being equal, yes the gross revenue yields would come down isolated to that one factoring Chase, because you still have the transactions, but the way that they are being charged gross equals net, no incentives. And so incentives would go down, gross yield would go down.\nCharles W. Scharf: And on the first point, let me take a shot at that for a second. So, there \u2013 the EC is investing \u2013 is investigating several different things. One of which is INTRA, European Credit Interchange, so this is where there is a card issued within Europe and its used inside of Europe. That affects Visa Europe, it does not affect us. For say, and they are also investigating inter \u2013 interchange, which is when it is a card issued outside of Europe and its used inside of Europe. We obviously don\u2019t know since we\u2019re in discussions with them weird winds up, we have nothing to report on exactly the specifics of what they\u2019re thinking in relative to how it impacts their view of the put. I think honestly that is a \u2013 that\u2019s a question for them, whether its for Visa Europe or for the banks themselves. I would say \u2013 what we think about is what it does to our thinking about Visa Europe. And in the different scenarios that I spoke about, to the extent that we have to go through a valuation process to understand what the sustainable earnings of Visa Europe would be, that whatever the conclusion of this inquiry would be, would obviously help us \u2013 point us towards what the affect of this could certainly be. And if it's something outside of the put, we would obviously have to take into account as well. But when it's concluded, we'll know the specifics and we'll be in a position to understand the impacts\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.: Thanks, guys. Just a clarification and a question. The clarification just in terms of other future deals, like the Chase deal, are you guys kind of waiting for inbound interest in terms of other issuers approaching you? Are you actually proactively marketing just two other biggest issuers? And then, just as my question also on the topic of the 10-Q, saw some language in there around CFPB taking a look at currency conversion fees on cross-border transactions, just any comments you may have on that? Thanks.\nByron H. Pollitt: Okay. So on the first question; we're not the type of organization that waits for our clients to call us. I mean in all seriousness, we talk with our clients literally day-in and day-out. So when this was announced, there were certainly extensive conversations that have gone on and continue to go on with clients of all sizes. And even before the announcement, the conversations that we've had were very consistent with the messaging that I laid out on the last call, which is that we want to be more flexible, we want to evolve our rules and we want to focus much more on working with merchants. So we are actively involved in talking to institutions of all sizes. I would describe them as very, very different types of conversations with people having different capabilities and different desires. And when I went through my introductory remarks, I kind of laid out what some of the principles are for us to follow, but if we can do things with them that would help them grow their business and help us grow payment volume, that's something we're very excited to do.\nCharles W. Scharf: Let me take the question on the CFPB. As you might imagine we have quite a bit of experience globally working with regulators and it's not uncommon for them to reach out in a very informational way to try and understand how certain practices unfold within our ecosystem, and that is very much the nature of this dialogue with the CFPB. They have reached out and asked us if we would help them \u2013 help educate them on how the currency trading ecosystem works as it relates to credit and debit cards. And so myself along with a number of my colleagues have met with them personally. It was a very straightforward educational type discussion focused on the mechanics of how currency conversion works. I would describe the working relationship as very cordial, very sound. I would say at the same time that our engagement is ongoing and we will of course keep you all informed as this dialogue unfolds.\nOperator: Our next question will come from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Charlie, since it's spring, it's the season for this. I was wondering how you would characterize the general tone for new fees at this point. Should we expect more or less revenue growth coming from new fees this year than in prior years?\nCharles W. Scharf: I didn't realize that spring was the period of time for new fees. I think I'll leave it at the revenue guidance overall that Byron gave, I think that's \u2013 for us to talk about in another level of detail of what we're forecasting for revenues would go beyond what is our practice and that's something that we wouldn't want to get into.\nByron H. Pollitt: I would just add to that. When we gave the original guidance that Charlie referred to at the beginning of the fiscal year, we said that it was that we would deliver our revenue the old fashion way through volume increases and that there would not be a material reliance on any sort of price -- pricing overall within the business plan for the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Your line is open.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Hey, great. So a two part question on the Chase VisaNet deal; can you just give us a sense of the reaction you\u2019re getting from other banks in the wake of that deal and also maybe the acquirer community how they\u2019re reacting. And if you see any major constraints on the ability of other particularly large banks to pursue a similar deal Chase VisaNet type deal? And then Byron maybe on the numbers, can you give us a sense on whether you expect to be revenue positive on the Chase deal over the next year after the -- clearly there\u2019s some discounting that\u2019s going on, on that contract. Will the volume gains from MasterCard at Chase offset the impact of the pricing discounts? Thanks.\nByron H. Pollitt: Let me start with the -- so why don\u2019t we start with the numbers. So the answer to the first part of the question was, do we expect to be volume accretive with the signing of this contract going into the \u2013 excuse me, revenue accretive going into the next year and the absolute \u2013 the question is absolutely yes, that when we factor in all the elements of the deal including those who reference we expect to have positive revenue growth with the Chase relationship in the coming year. And relative to the reaction of \u2013 from banks and acquirers to Chase, I mean I would honestly \u2013 I guess, I would say it was mixed initially and quite candidly it was probably confusing because there were not a lot of facts because there were terms disclosed at the point of a letter of intent not a final contract which is what we have signed now. So we have been able to have much more in depth conversations about what it is, similar to what we\u2019ve talked about here. And I think the conversation is very much at move to what is it, it's confusing, what does it mean and this is both on the bank side and the acquirer side to really what Visa do to help them customize and differentiate with their experience. So we\u2019re having that discussion, again from small institutions to much bigger institutions and acquirers alike and as I said, I think the overwriting concept here is; the world is changing around us. And there are lots of people that we compete with and people who want to compete with us that have strategies around working with merchants at point of sale and if we don\u2019t figure out how to evolve our model to encourage issuers and acquirers to do that then we\u2019ll be leaving great opportunity on the table and so we do have to be flexible on how we do it as long as we don\u2019t think that it violates any of the principles that I spoke about before and we feel very good that what we\u2019re doing actually does that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan: Thanks, good results. I\u2019ll ask a couple of the modeling nerd questions. Data processing fee that yield or revenue per trend, I jumped that quite a bit. The biggest we\u2019ve seen in a long time. What's driving that and I guess, going forward that will be impacted to some degree by the Chase deal and secondly the international transaction fee line looks like the revenue growth grew at a premium to cross-border volume for the first time over a couple of quarters, what's driving that as well? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf: So let me respond. So, on the data processing yield, as you all remember about a year ago as part of our Dodd-Frank debit mitigating strategy we restructured our pricing. We introduced a lower variable transaction fee. We introduced for the first time a fixed acquirer network fee. When we first introduced those in the way that we bill and record revenue we had to do that to a certain degree with some estimates, and since it was a new pricing structure. And as we conclude the March quarter, we pretty much got a year of this under our belt. And so we're now in a position where we can start to true up some of these estimates. And what you saw in the data processing yield line was some true-up there and a few credits. Going forward, I would say that the data processing yield is more likely to approximate what you saw in Q1 as opposed to Q2, still very solid but I think that's from a nerdy modeling standpoint; I think that's probably the guidance we were looking for. With regards to international, as we have talked about this particular line on several occasions before, there is always some degree of variability between volume and reported revenue. Part of it is revenue mix. Part of it is the amount of volatility we see in the currency markets. And in periods where there is a higher degree of volatility, often associated with saber rattling or conflicting claims on islands in the China Sea, anything \u2013 issues around Cypress, anything that royals the currency markets and creates more volatility, creates a bit more \u2013 has an impact on the revenue that we report. And so that was the case with international this past quarter. We had a step-up in currency volatility relative to what we've seen historically. And then we also had little bit of a tailwind with regards to the specific currency and their waiting during the quarter, some currencies just naturally yield more of a return across our fee base than others. So that's the reason.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Your line is open.\nRobert Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Thank you. Just two quick ones. What would be the strategy on funding the put if it were to be executed? And then secondly, I'd like a little update on CyberSource. It's been growing 25% for the last couple of years, it doesn't seem to be slowing and I just wondered if the revenue was growing in line with that? And what the operating profit margin is on that CyberSource business and any update on strategy would be helpful?\nCharles W. Scharf: So let me take that. So in the event that we needed to consider funding for Visa Europe, let me just give you the following perspective. We currently \u2013 at the end of this quarter, we have roughly 2.2 billion of cash that is in offshore accounts not immediately required for working capital. That 2.2 would be available for use in a Visa Europe put situation. Once the put \u2013 if and when the put is exercised, we have 285 days to negotiate out and fund the transaction. During that period, we would generate in the normal course of business at least 3 billion of free cash flow. So before we ever get to debt, if any were to be required, recognizing we have no debt we've got 5 billion of cash readily available to deploy. And that's not to say that we would use all that cash because this might \u2013 again, if the put were to be exercised, this might be a good opportunity to actually put some debt on the balance sheet and lower our weighted average cost of capital. The second question was CyberSource. CyberSource was acquired, as you might remember, because it moved us closer to the merchant checkout page with regards to Internet transactions. The fastest growing channel we have today is Ecom and CyberSource gives us an additional value add in the transaction and a way of directly connecting to the acquirer to our network in a way that is very synergistic with the rest of our business. When we acquired CyberSource, it was primarily a U.S. business. The opportunity for us was outside the United States. And so we have invested aggressively inside resource to accelerate the expansion of that business outside the United States and as a result have been successful in sustaining its transaction growth rate at 20 plus percent ever since we acquired the business. And I can tell you that, that transaction growth rate is slightly above the pro forma projections that we presented to our board when we justified the purchase price. So we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the role CyberSource is now playing in the Visa Inc global strategy as we zero in on capitalizing on the internet growth opportunity which is absolutely global in its scope.\nByron H. Pollitt: And I\u2019ll just add, as we -- all of our work that we\u2019ve got going on with merchants as I talked about, CyberSource and its capabilities are a tremendous advantage for us in those conversations.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Julio Contreras of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJulio Contreras - Goldman Sachs: Hey guys not to beat a dead horse, but I guess I\u2019ll keep jumping on this Chase Merchant Services contract. Thinking through the reaction I guess, mostly as it relates to, kind of the independent or standalone merchant acquirers versus the bank owned merchant acquirers, how exactly would you distinguish the benefits to each one of these guys, especially if they don\u2019t actually issue their own cards?\nCharles W. Scharf: Well, again I think, I guess the way we think about it is; what we\u2019re willing -- the importance of what we did with Chase is not specifically about the Chase structure. It's about what the intent we\u2019re trying to get at, which is to put issuers and acquirers together to work directly with merchants. So, to the extent that a bank owns an acquirer it obviously allows you to have that conversation under one roof, to the extent you have issuers who don\u2019t control their own acquirers hopefully now they\u2019re thinking about and that are in fact having conversations with acquirers about the types of things that they could do if they worked more closely together. The reality is, I think if you go around and talk to most issuers they would probably say that there wasn\u2019t a lot of conversation that went on between the issuing and acquiring side, and partially because of our rules that stood in the way of them working together to do something positive for the merchant. And so now that we\u2019ve given them the ability to do that, I don\u2019t -- it shouldn\u2019t -- you don\u2019t have to own your own acquirer in order to take advantage of the changes that we\u2019ve made. And I think quite frankly we\u2019ll see how it evolves. I think, going back to Rod\u2019s question earlier I mean, there are -- there\u2019s some people that look at this and say, okay, got it, understand it, but it don\u2019t believe it. I think it's too hard, I don\u2019t think it's going to be successful, I don\u2019t intend to change anything, and we\u2019ll wait and see. And if we get to a point of, hey there\u2019s something there then we\u2019ve got capabilities and we\u2019ll go forward with that. There are others that are more interested in thinking through how to take advantage of some of the things that we\u2019re willing to do. And I think honestly this will evolve over the next, it will take -- I am going to say a couple of years. It's not the type of thing that will be -- won't be very, very short. If they involved not just conversations between issuers and acquirers but you have to have conversations with merchants. They have to believe that there\u2019s a real value proposition there. They have got to do some thing different potentially in their stores with their customers, and that\u2019s not always the most obviously and easy conversation but again we think it's the right conversation to have, but it's a thesis that has to be proved.\nOperator: Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller - Barclays Capital Inc.: Thanks. Listen just to firstly clarify on the Chase deal timing again, and then a quick question on the stored wallet fee. So, first on Chase, did the deal economics actually show up at all on the quarter that was just reported, in terms of the incentives and the -- because you came in at 16% as a percentage of gross revenue, so it seems a little lower than the 18% plus. And then just a question on the stored wallet fee that MasterCard has announced, it seems like these are still not committed to doing that as far as at least we have seen. Can you just give us some idea and thought around that fee and really your interaction with for instance, PayPal and some of the ecommerce players that, that could affect?\nCharles W. Scharf: Okay, let me take the first one. So, just to clarify the question, did \u2013 because the Chase deal was signed in April actually, it did not have any impact to the quarter just reported. So this is \u2013 it has a retroactive effect a little bit earlier, but that is all contemplated in the guidance that we gave for the balance of the year.\nCharles W. Scharf: And on the staged wallet question, so first of all just on the actual staged wallet fee that MasterCard implemented, that's not something that we're currently contemplating but we're actively thinking through what has changed in the ecosystem and how we have to react to that. Our relationship with PayPal and people like them has evolved. It's complicated. They specifically are a very important customer of ours, but they have their own ambitions and we're mindful, I think, first and foremost of the impact that they have both positively and negatively potentially on our issuers because that ultimately will be what determines our success. And I think we are actively thinking about the right way to restructure the ecosystem in a way that works for everyone. And we've got nothing to announce now, but we will at some point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Togut of Evercore Partners. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.: Thank you. What is Visa's strategy to gain market share in the corporate card market versus MasterCard?\nCharles W. Scharf: Byron, do you want to talk about\u2026\nByron H. Pollitt: So, in the commercial side this is \u2013 a lot of success in this marketplace is dependent on the sophistication of the platforms that you bring to bear to service corporate clients. It's a very information reporting intensive business. And we have made significant investments over the last several years in a platform we refer to as IntelliLink. We believe what we have today is a state-of-the-art and one that has been compared to where we were five years ago has been a game changer for us in terms of being much more successful in capturing commercial business, and it's largely driven by the investments in the sophistication of reporting multi-currency, multi-country and that's really the lead card we play.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nGlenn Fodor - Autonomous Research: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just turning to U.S. credit, clearly you've had a great run recently; you've been posting above market growth. But what's important for us is to get a sense of how much longer this can continue. So on the vein, is it possible just roughly to parse your growth into maybe sources of three buckets like just having faster growing clients because of client-specific reasons, clients that are growing Visa volume faster because of the things you're doing with them. And then finally just share gains overall. And can you roughly bucket that for us? And then maybe sum it up with some texture of how much pent-up above market growth do you have in the backlog and the pipeline here to give us confidence that this can continue for several more quarters or even beyond that?\nCharles W. Scharf: I guess I'll just start Byron and you can chime in. I mean, it's obviously \u2013 it's very hard right now to put things into the buckets numerically the way you spoke about. But I think when you look at our issuing base, we've certainly benefited from the partnerships that we have with the faster growing issuers out there. And you can say that that's luck on our part historically or it's that Visa targeted the right population of customers. And I think it stands for itself. Things don't happen by chance and we do have a very fast growing set of customers that we certainly benefit from. And the same thing is true relative to the co-brands that we have. Co-brands can put us just like anything else not all co-brands are equal, and we think we\u2019ve got the premier client base out there and we\u2019ve been clearly very big beneficiaries of that and would expect that to continue.\nCharles W. Scharf: I will just add one other component to this, in addition to the quality and the growth delivered by the issuer that\u2019s also impacted by the quality of the card holder portfolio as measured by affluent income levels and we\u2019re very well positioned in the affluent portfolios and if you think about it, what has driven the credit card, payment volume, growth over the \u2013 certainly over the past two years has been predominantly affluent. And so being well positioned as the economy recovers this is an area where we\u2019re well positioned to sustain this kind of growth. It should be less volatile in that sense and so we certainly feel it has strong leg. Relative to the delta, that\u2019s a much harder one to frame.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian King of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities: Yeah, hi guys. Just a couple of questions, I guess first on the EC enquiry, does that have any potential impact on Visa\u2019s fees or are we talking about Visa Europe fees and then on the Chase of Visa deal, I guess two questions one, are we talking about a material amount of volume that you guys expect the consumer credit and that I\u2019m just trying to get a sense if that\u2019s new cards just for new business or will that be some of the existing business. And then finally on the, I\u2019ve heard you say Charlie before that the Chase could have done this on-us transactions before so, then the question comes out, then why they\u2019re using Visa at all, and is Visa getting any money at all for allowing on-us transactions. Thanks so much.\nCharles W. Scharf: Well, let\u2019s start there. What we said they could do historically was enter into pricing arrangements, directly with merchants relative to interchange. And again anyone can do that today, and that\u2019s not specific to on-us transactions. So, I am not sure then the rest of the question flow so if we didn\u2019t answer it, maybe come back and ask us the question again. But they and everyone else have the ability to go and negotiate interchange and they\u2019ve got the ability to do that in this agreement in a different format and different structure. On the size of the Chase commitment, again I think the best way to characterize that is what Byron said, which net-net all in all we think that we\u2019re still in a position to grow revenues and how we get there and what not is, not something that I think is appropriate for us to talk about. And back on the first piece, on the EC inquiry it is on interchange, and so that would be the direct impact of what it is they\u2019re looking at today.\nJack Carsky: At this point we have time for one more question operator.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Moshe Katri of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.\nCharles W. Scharf: Moshe.\nByron H. Pollitt: Moshe, are you there?\nOperator: He disconnected. We can go on to a next question if you wish?\nCharles W. Scharf: Okay, someone hit the lottery.\nOperator: John Williams of UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Williams - UBS: Hey, you snuck me in. Thank you, guys. Thanks for taking my question.\nCharles W. Scharf: Thank Moshe.\nByron H. Pollitt: Thank Moshe.\nJohn Williams - UBS: I will. So I had a follow-up, I hate to beat the dead horse on Chase Merchant Services and forgive the basic nature of my question, but I think it's reasonable to say J.P. Morgan is not paying you guys very much in the way of assessment fees and so as you consider doing this deal, what was lacking in the relationship that made something of this magnitude necessary, I mean obviously you\u2019re locking up a large customer for a while but how does Visa actually benefit in an incremental way because it sounds like on one hand you might get more transactions but on the other hand the on-us transactions will stay on us. So if you could give a little more color on how you guys specifically benefit in incremental way that would be helpful. Thank you.\nCharles W. Scharf: Yeah, I mean I\u2019ll give your point of view but again why, some of those questions I think are important for them. So specifically from our point of view, we don't believe that this structure was necessary to accomplish what the end goal is. The structure is something that we worked on together because it's something that was important to them, but that's \u2013 which is why we believe that this structure isn't specific to them that we could go accomplish the same thing by working with issuers and acquirers separately without this kind of structural transaction that occurred. The benefit in this, if we're successful at this is really related to the rule change that we made, which encourages and allows the issuers and acquirers to go talk to merchants directly and to ask the question what can we do for you or to propose an idea of we can do the following thing for you to help you drive more sales and drive more volume into your stores and in return for that presumably, there will be additional transactions that get directed to the Visa cards. Again, this structure we don't believe is necessary to do that, but it certainly allows that to happen and that's what was important to us.\nByron H. Pollitt: Let me just add on the economics, John, that this business has always been built on an economic business model that says the larger the clients, the larger the portfolio, the better pricing you get. And this was one of our largest clients, one of the largest portfolios. We had the opportunity to enter into a 10-year arrangement that has a set of economics that are consistent with how we have been doing multi-year contracts with other clients over the years, including Chase. And given the size of this portfolio and where we expected to be over the next five and 10 years, is there margin compression? Yes. But that margin compression is consistent and the same zip code is what we would normally have expected to have put on the table given the size of the portfolio and the kind of growth that we are expecting this partnership to produce. So from that standpoint, we are very comfortable with the economics of this deal.\nJack Carsky: With that, we want to thank you all for joining us once again. And just to reiterate what Charlie said earlier, we are hosting an Investor Day on June 6 here in San Francisco. Formal invites have been sent out, many people have responded. If you haven't and intend to do so, please do. And if you are inadvertently left off that list, let Vic or I know and we'll make sure you get the formal invite and any other follow-up questions also to me or Vic. Thanks again.\nCharles W. Scharf: Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation on the conference call today.

I just want to start by letting everyone know how excited I\u2019m to be part of Visa. After 10 years as some combination of an issue or a member of the Board, its great to be part of a team that I\u2019ve known for 10 years or so. And especially Byron and his team, whom I\u2019m going to embarrass him a little bit, he is even more impressive from inside the Company than he was from outside the Company as well as the team. I do feel lucky to be part of what clearly is a growth Company and a growth industry. These times are exciting. We got some great competition out there, both from traditional players and from new players. But as I\u2019m going to talk a little bit here in the call, we love our position. Well first, we\u2019re going to go through the quarter, which as you saw was very, very strong. And then even more importantly, I think once we go beyond that I\u2019m going to talk a little bit more about our continued strong investment in the future of the Company. And it's our confidence in that you can see is exhibited by the additional share repurchase authorization that\u2019s in today\u2019s announcement. So Byron, going to walk through the quarter and then I\u2019ll come back and give you some more detail thoughts and leave plenty time for Q&A at the end.\nByron H. Pollitt: Thank you, Charlie. As its my practice, I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, Visa\u2019s 12% net revenue growth in the fiscal first quarter was once again broad based as we continue to see strong credit and debit growth in the U.S. and the Rest of World, as well as a return to positive growth in our worldwide debit business. Second, client incentives for the quarter. As a percentage of growths revenue, we\u2019re 16.3% and below our full-year guidance. This was a result of both lower than expected deal activity in the quarter and timing issues associated with incentives to certain clients. We expect these payments to be realized in the coming quarters. Third, aggregate U.S. debit payment volume posted a negative 4% growth rate in the fiscal first quarter of 2013 versus a negative 6% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012. Of note, Q1 Interlink payment volume growth was off 44% versus 48% in the September ending quarter. Fourth, Visa\u2019s effective tax rate of 28.2% was positively impacted by a tax benefit recognized during the quarter as a result of new guidance issued by the State of California regarding apportionment rules. As a result we booked a credit of $76 million after tax representing about a $0.11 of EPS, which resulted in a significantly reduced tax rate for the quarter. This catch-up benefit is consistent with our full-year tax and EPS guidance. Fifth, in wake of receiving preliminary court approval of the merchant litigation settlement agreement in December, we made a $4 billion cash payment from Visa's litigation escrow account to the Class Plaintiffs' settlement fund. This was in addition to $350 million paid out in October to the individual merchants. The net result of these payments will be to increase our free cash flow by about $1.6 billion this year, given our ability to deduct these payments from our U.S. tax return. Lastly, we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders with a new $1.75 billion share repurchase program. To put this in perspective, during the quarter, we spent $1.3 billion to repurchase 9 million shares at an average price of about $145. At the end of fiscal Q1, we had 1.1 billion of remaining authorization to which we added the 1.75 billion bringing our total open to buy to just under $3 billion. Our priorities for the use of this cash remain the same. First, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisitions and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the fiscal first quarter followed by our results through January 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2013. Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 9%, up from the September quarter's 6%. More recently in the U.S. through January 28, payment volume growth was 5% compared with 3% in the December ending quarter. Both U.S. credit and debit experienced improved growth rates. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 11% constant dollar growth rate in the December quarter, which compares to a 10% rate in the September quarter. The U.S. grew 9%; rest of world 11%. We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. Through January 28, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 12% with the U.S. growth rate of 10%, rest of world at 12%. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 14.2 billion in the fiscal first quarter, a 4% increase over the prior year period. A 4% decline in U.S. debit transactions was offset by a positive 21% growth in debit and credit in the rest of world. Note that as we begin to lap the impact of changes in U.S. debit regulations, we expect our U.S. debit metrics to show improved results. Consistent with that dynamic through January 28, processed transaction growth was a positive 6% driven by an improving trajectory in U.S. processed transaction growth. Separately, CyberSource reported 1.6 billion transactions for the period, a 28% increase over the prior period. Now let's turn to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.8 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year driven by solid growth in global payment volumes, data processing revenues, international revenues and as mentioned earlier lower than anticipated client incentives. After hedges, there was no meaningful foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter. Moving to the individual revenue line items; service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 13% over the prior year period. Revenue growth exceeded constant dollar payment volume growth of 6% largely due to the decline in Interlink, a debit product that does not generate service revenues. Data processing revenue was $1.1 billion, up 17% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions outside the U.S., strong CyberSource transaction growth as well as strategic pricing actions taken last year related to the restructuring of our pricing in the U.S. debit market. International transaction revenue was up 8% to $805 million, reflecting solid strength in cross-border volumes. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 16.3% lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to the timing of deals and certain incentive payments. In future quarters we anticipate a step up in incentive levels as a percentage of gross revenue consistent with our full-year guidance expectations of 18% to 18.5%. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1 billion, up 13% from the prior-year. This was primarily due to higher personnel and professional fees associated with investments in our growth strategies. Marketing expenses were up a modest 2% from the prior-year as the first half of the year tends to be our quietest and will ramp up over the year in line with our guidance of under $1 billion for fiscal 2013. Operating margin for the quarter was 63%, well slightly ahead of our full-year guidance of about 60, this margin level is consistent with how we planned for the year. As noted earlier, our effective tax rate for Q1 was 28.2%. The lower rate for the quarter was primarily due to a favorable clarification in the apportionment rules for the State of California. The resulting benefit was related to prior periods. That said, the Q1 tax rate is fully consistent with our full-year guidance of 30% to 32%. Finally, capital expenditures were a $100 million in the quarter in line with our full-year expectations. The adjusted weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fiscal first quarter totaled $669 million. Other than the change in free cash flow guidance to about $6 billion, there are no other changes to our fiscal guidance. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Charlie.\nCharles W. Scharf: Thanks a lot Byron. I thought maybe what I would do being new to the Company is start by just talking about my view of the Company, the way I think about it, and then move into priorities. And I guess, I\u2019d frame my thoughts on the Company by starting off with the fact that having been here for three months and been around the world spending time with people here, I am more bullish today about the opportunities that we have than the day I joined. And I think that\u2019s true about the short-term and the long-term, and let me just go through some reasons why. First of all, as you all know the resiliency of the business model really is something pretty special. Everyone is aware of the global economic environment, the conditions that we have been working through. The important thing for us is that we continue to have the ability to deliver through the economic cycle. Second of all, and I wouldn\u2019t underestimate this issue which is that, there\u2019s a clear desire and a need for our product both socially and economically. And when you travel around the world it comes through loud and clear. Our products help economies grow and they help people of all wealth levels, as well as merchants and governments of all sizes. And again especially once you leave the United States as you talk to the governments, as you talk to merchant\u2019s that is the message that we get loud and clear. And then we also can\u2019t forget about this huge number of 2.5 billion people across the world that don\u2019t have access to the formal financial system today. And our products that we offer can bring them into it. It really is something overtime that will improve their lives and improve the economies in the countries that they live in and help advance those countries. And obviously as you\u2019ve seen from things like Rwanda and some other stuff we\u2019ll talk about those great government interest in doing that. Third, there's a strong secular trend that's clear. This continued growth in electronification of payments which we\u2019ve been living through is going to continue. Importantly, the way we think about it here first and foremost we compete with cash and checks. After that we compete with others in the market place, but there\u2019s so much cash and check across the globe is still somewhat astonishing and even more astonishing the price getting bigger. There\u2019s more cash today than there was five years ago. And so this is just obviously a great opportunity for us in the market that we play in. Fourth, we have an enviable competitive position. You all know the share numbers, but it's just not share. It's the relationships that we have across the globe. It's the fact that we're a trusted partner in the payments industry, because of both \u2013 what our brand is but also what we've actually delivered over a long period of time here. And again, when you go outside of the United States, the power of the brand just, it's something that people talk about over and over again. And those opportunities outside of the United States are exciting. That's the fifth reason that I put in the bullish category because we've got huge opportunity in both developed and less developed countries outside the United States and I'll talk a little more of that in a second. The quality of the people at Visa across the globe is terrific. This company has been built by the people that have been here and it's great to be able to work even more closely with them. And then the last thing I'll just talk about here is just our network for a second. I'm not sure we spend enough time talking about it, but it's obviously the core of who we are. But we have one global network and just a perspective of coming from outside the company very few global companies out there can say that they have one network across the globe. It's efficient, it's controlled, it's a great platform. And so to the extent we want to do things and scale them across the world, we can do them in a way that a lot of other industries would really struggle to do. The networks been built over decades. We all know that it provides great global acceptance, clearing, authorization and settlement, but it's proven to be safe and secure. It's battletested through the years as though I think about it and we continue to invest aggressively because the world of cyber criminals is growing not shrinking, and I'd rather have our network than anyone else's at this point as we continue to build on that security. And this becomes a competitive advantage over time. But beyond just the core capabilities of our network, the real differentiation for us is how we use it for our participants. And I think about our participants, issuers, acquirers, cardholders and merchants in this category. We have been and will continue to drive more functionality to benefit our customers. That's risk management, that's marketing, it's offers, it's things like that and we'll continue to extend access to the network and that's a big part of what our mobile activities are. And as long as we continue to do that, our network is far from a commodity. So moving to priorities for a second, I think it's totally appropriate to be clear that my first priority is to make sure that we continue this momentum here. The quarter speaks for itself. The past few quarters \u2013 not few, the past quarters over an extended period of time here say an awful lot about the momentum that this company has. I could go through a long list of wins right now in the quarter, I'm not going to do that, I'm not sure we all get benefit from that. What I'd rather do is just focus on some examples of some interesting things that we're doing across the globe. First example is Saral Money. It's a partnership with five leading clients, the Delhi state government and the Indian national identity system that links the national ID number with biometric information to provide instant authentication and complete a paperless process to open a bank account and issue a Visa debit or prepaid card instantly. It's terrific, it's in-market and something we're very excited about. We also announced a strategic agreement with QIWI. QIWI is Russia's leading payment services provider. They provides digital wallet to more than 9 million active Russian customers who use them at more than hundred thousand cash kiosks. What our agreement really is all about is transitioning the wallet from a single bank model to a digital wallet with stored value account based upon Visa prepaid cards that can be issued by any Visa client bank. It will be a great product to have alongside our own product. And then the country of Myanmar, we're bringing electronic payments to the country. We enabled the first credit card payment through Visa-branded wireless point-of-sale terminal and now credit debt in prepaid cards are able to be used in selected merchants. Another great example of the momentum that we have is V.me, our electronic wallet. I know you've heard about it, but it's actually -- it's real, it's live, it's in the market. At the end of 2012, we had 31 merchant sites live. We have an additional 132 signed up through yesterday, I believe, and we have 63 issuers who have signed up to participate. Those issuers represent 55 million Visa cards, includes so far 12 of the top 25 U.S. banks, 51 U.S. regional banks and PNC and Bank of America have integrated V.me into their online banking websites. So I could go on about more things, but I thought I just turn out to some of the strategic priorities as I see them. First and probably foremost is the continue to extend the electronification of payments. Its obvious, but the pie is so big here, the more we do its good for all. For us to be able to do that, we\u2019re going to have to figure out how to be more flexible. This organization got great history with great results, but if you go around and talk to issuers, acquirers, merchants, we can be a little too rules oriented and so we\u2019ve got to figure out how we become less focused on rules, while preserving what\u2019s important to keep the integrity of our network in place. By doing things like that, we can work with our customers to create more customized solutions and support issuers of all sizes. Not a small opportunity for us, its I think a big opportunity for us to partner more closely with our customers. Next I would put the second biggest strategic priority, technology and innovation were generally. Again, my perspective here having, participated with the Company for a period of time is just great progress. Three years ago when I was still on the Board, there was very, very little going on here relative to using these new technologies to benefit us. It was still up the tail end of taking the Company public merging the entities and whatnot, and over the past three years the progress has been really terrific. I talked about V.me, again, its not an idea, its in the market today. The work on mobile here continues, both organically and with the acquisition of Fundamo. It\u2019s a critical access point to a network and continued investment in that is absolutely critical for us. As we think about these capabilities and thinking about things that we do our \u2013 again, our focus is on extending the core network and access some capabilities of that network. We love the business we\u2019re in, we integrate business, that\u2019s the core of who we are to the network, its processing and the things that we\u2019re going to focus on will continue to be those things that support those core assets.\n : People when you go, when you talk to people about our business, you can think about it two different ways. You can think about it as if, which we do know there are other people that do what we do with that core asset that we have. And one way to approach that from the outside is to look at it and say, who\u2019s the cheapest price out there? But in anything, no matter what you do in life there\u2019s always a cheaper price out there; and our job is to make sure that we provide more value and whether it's through the relationship building, whether it's through helping people marketing, whether it's using their data, using their information, building things like V.me, building mobile. All those things that we do create more value, and so that people look at us much more of a partner than a vendor over time. Third priority, international growth, again not something new, you\u2019ve heard about this quite a bit. We\u2019ve got an off a lot going on. It is also, I think it's important to say. We love the United States. We love our position in the United States. We've got some really neat stuff going on here. So, it's not to say otherwise, but it's hard not to look at what the opportunity is outside the U.S. and say it's just large. It's all across the world. Here too it's booked short-term and long-term. Its large developed markets where there are big cash based economies like Japan, and there are merging market all over the world with very little acceptance as I\u2019ve referred to earlier. We\u2019re investing aggressively here. We\u2019re opening new offices and adding people in country. In 2012 we opened six new offices, 17 expansions and more to come this year. We\u2019re growing acceptance. We\u2019re expanding cyber source globally. We're working closely with governments. It's a huge part of the effort to partner with governments, to push electronification of payments. And country by country, we've got very, very specific and very different strategies. Some parts of the world, NFC through payWave is extremely important in places like Canada and Australia and the products we have are extremely helpful to us in building our business there. Other places, its traditional debit, credit and prepaid. And other places we know the importance of mobile. So we're going to continue to invest here and take advantage of the large opportunity that we all know exists. The next priority, number four, I would talk about merchant relationships. This is one where we provide great value for merchants. I absolutely believe that. And you've got examples like Square-type technology and pricing on those products out there which just shows you that people -- small merchants are willing to pay to electronify their world because they know how difficult and how expensive cash is. Having said that, we also have to acknowledge that it's on us along with our issuers and acquirers that we do business with to prove to merchants day-in and day-out. Some believe it, and I've had conversations with plenty of merchants that think we do a great job partnering with them, but obviously there are an awful lot which are very vocal that don't believe that here in the United States, and again that's on us to figure out how to change the nature of that relationship. So we need to do a whole lot more. It starts with engaging them very differently. I'm not talking about the courts through D.C., I'm talking about directly. We need to balance their issues with others in our value chain. It's just an extremely important concept that needs to permeate the way we think about our business. And most importantly, it's up to us to prove to them that we can actually help them grow. We talk about this internally that Visa cardholders are the largest single source of potential spend in the world. And to the extent that we can work with merchants, again, through our issuers and acquirers and show them how we can add value to them in building their businesses, that's what we've got to do to change the nature of our relationship. And so we will be doing a lot more of that. Employees, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about employees as a priority because this is a business based upon the quality of the people that we have. We've got a great group of people here across the globe who I've gotten to know and it's my job to continue to create the most attractive environment, so we've got the best, the smartest and most vibrant thinking in this company. Sixth, capital allocation and if you're sitting on the edge of your seat for something new, you're not going to get it. The company historically and I \u2013 I'd say first of all have great respect for the responsibility. We understand what it means and we understand what shareholders want. And as Byron has said in the past, our jobs are to put capital to use intelligently or return it to you and that's been a consistent theme since the IPO. Intelligently means investing it in our core assets, organically or through acquisitions like you've seen us do. But obviously if we don't see those opportunities, then we're going to return it to you through dividends and buybacks. We're going to always prioritize what we're going to do based upon the returns for the shareholder and our goal is to reward shareholders that continue to own the stock. So, again, it's something that is hopefully a whole lot of consistency with my thinking and with the thinking that's been here. And then the last priority I'll end with is the continuing open dialogue that Visa has had with the investor community. I certainly look forward to getting to know all of you. I know some of you. I look forward to getting to know many more of you, sharing my thoughts, our thoughts in more detail. And to that end, just so you know, we're working on planning of an Investor Day which we're going to firm up the timing and Jack will be back to you with the specifics relatively quickly on that. So before we open it for Q&A, let me just start by saying a couple of things here. I hope you get the sense as I talk about how I feel about the opportunity here that the runway for growth is long and it's deep. As we think about what we do here, we've got to balance the short and the long term. And what that means is there is no long when you think about a short term, so we know we must deliver. But when people hear -- people like to ask the generic question of how you define success five years now? To me, it's really all about -- we feel great about the opportunity for the next five years, but success is going to be that we're sitting here five years from now and we feel as good about the forward-looking growth as we do today. And if that doesn't happen, shame on us because we've got the assets and we've got the business to do that. And we are confident that we will do it. So with that, I will stop and Byron and I are here to answer your questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.: Thanks and Charlie welcome abroad. I appreciate all the comments. Just wanted to pick up on one of the things you said in terms of Visa potentially becoming a little bit less rules oriented going forward. And I think you kind of elaborate on there and how soon we might see this? And then Byron, if you can just give us a quick clarification on the tax rate issue. It sounds like what you\u2019re saying is that you guys already had anticipated this tax benefit when you give the 30% to 32% full-year tax rate guidance and the high-teen VPS guidance for last quarter is that accurate?\nByron H. Pollitt: Why don\u2019t I start on the tax rate, that\u2019s correct, your tax rate is always comprised of components. This was a component that the timing of which uncertain. But this type of component was contemplated and as a result it\u2019s fully consistent with the guidance we gave at the end of last quarter.\nCharles W. Scharf: And Jason I will take the question on flexibility. I think \u2013 the way to think about that one is \u2013 again, if you go around and you talk to issuers across the globe and if you talk to merchants and if you ask what is the negative quality of these, hopefully after they go the long list of positives, they will talk about that we\u2019re not as flexible as we could be, we got lots and lots of rules. And so what that means is they tend to get nervous that we can just change rules. They\u2019re not sure about how that might impact them in the future. And our goal should be that we got rules that protect the integrity and the value of our payments network. That\u2019s why they were put in place to begin with and they\u2019ve just grown over a period of time. So, what we have to do is \u2013 as the Company evolves it has become much more commercial figure, define the rules as those things that are quote \u2018who we\u2019re\u2019 and the protection of the value of our networks I described and then move other things into commercial arrangements that you would have with customers.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.\nCraig Maurer - CLSA: Hi, and let me add my congratulations on your first quarter with Visa. You talked earlier about the importance of a global network, but Visa is a separate entity from V.me \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, from Visa Europe, V.me well. Anyway Visa Europe and I wanted your thoughts on how long-term Visa Europe plays into the global strategy?\nCharles W. Scharf:\n :\nOperator: Our next question will come from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nGlenn Fodor - Autonomous Research: Hi, good evening. Charlie, I look forward to working with you. I\u2019m just trying to get my hands around what Visa\u2019s strategy might look like as technology changes the industry; and Charlie how far do you think Visa might stray from it's historical role if exclusively a network in the middle, and by this I mean, developing more consumer facing initiatives like V.me. And then how would you reconcile this strategy with those of your constituent partners who often times are pursuing these same strategies so there could be some, your competitive or brand conflict there? Thank you.\nCharles W. Scharf: Yeah. We\u2019re here to support the customers of our issuers and acquirers. That\u2019s the way we think about it. That\u2019s the way things are built here and that\u2019s the way things will continue to be build. So, something like V.me, we're building V.me on behalf of our customers. If you go use V.me, you will have to register for it so that your information gets in there. But from that point forward, it is completely supportive of our banks. When you pay for something using V.me, we have the ability to show the card art exactly as it exists in someone's wallet today. So, V.me is not meant to be direct to consumer to go around our issuers, it's actually just the opposite. It's meant to support them with the electronic wallet that will enable them to continue to grow commerce. So as we think about \u2013 I want to talk about extending who we are, we love the business that we're in. Presumably, you all love the business that we're in which is why we trade the way we do. And so we're very mindful of that. And the opportunities for us to continue to figure out how to use technology whether it's our own or whether it's other peoples, to feed that network and to use our assets is what we're focused on.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dan Perlin of RBC. Your line is open.\nDaniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Thanks. So I just want to return to this issue of capital allocation and I know that you said there's not much of a change. But I was thinking more in terms of the first priority is always back into the business and I heard you mention in your kind of prepared remarks around priorities and others, outside the U.S. a number of times. So I'm wondering if you could just shed some light without being too specific, I suspect on kind of how we should be thinking about capital redeployment through this geographic mix that you guys have? Thank you.\nByron H. Pollitt: I'll start. So I would say the first call on the growth in our capital is going to be software development that underpins our new products in mobile, V.me or right on the point of the sphere with that. That would support products that were to be deployed both in the United States and in rest of world and the development of those products, the actual incurring of the capital would also actually occur both in the United States and outside. As you build additional product capability and extension of the services we offer, that will also require investment in infrastructure. Now just the capacity to house, to operate and to process, but also new challenges like security. So VisaNet very, very formidable battletested defenses as you start moving into products that are going to start operating as an extension outside of VisaNet, but it requires additional investment in technologies in order to properly secure. And so that is the primary source of hard dollar capital. And then as Charlie mentioned, we still have an enormous runway of growth in our base business. So we are adding offices, we are expanding, we are putting more people on the ground. We are at our best when we have people deployed in country giving personalized, tailored service to our clients, banks, acquirers, merchants. And so that reinvestment will not just be capital expenditure, it will also be operating expense with an immediate return in the core business.\nCharles W. Scharf: Let me just add to what Byron said. If you just look at relative levels and just get my own view coming in from the outside is there's a lot of investment that's going on here. You see it in the expense line. You see it in the initiatives. You see \u2013 I mean you don't get to [work] with something like V.me without putting the resources into it or being able to be in the market with mobile, without having used the capital on something like Fundamo and whatnot. So, there is a significant level of investment going on with what you see and it still allows us to do what we've done with the dividend and with the repurchase program here. So, we feel like there's just plenty of room for all of those things.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Great. Charlie, so with your experience on the bank side, are there tangible steps for you to make \u2013 to help Visa improve its relationship with the banks, particularly the large banks. For instance, as you push new products like V.me, you need the large banks on board, and so far it\u2019s unclear to what extent the largest banks are fully supportive at this point. It\u2019s helpful to hear that 12 of the top 25 banks are signed up for V.me, but that could imply that 13 of 25 are not signed up at least at this point; and so that\u2019s one example. But on that example and Visa\u2019s general relationship with large banks, are there tangible steps to take to better engage with the banks? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf: Yeah, I guess, let me answer it a couple of ways. I mean, to just \u2013 listen, we can always improve relationships, so that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, but I will come back to that. I said 12 with the top 25; we have four of the top 10, who are already signed up for it. And again, when you say large banks, the Bank of America is a great partner of ours. PNC is a great partner of ours. U.S. Bank is a great partner of ours. TD Bank is great partner, I mean, I can go on through the names. We have a great list of partners that are currently signed up for it. I spent a bunch of time myself talking to the biggest banks in this country, but just so you know I don't spend all my time thinking about the biggest banks in this country, the big banks here are important, but so are the regional banks, so are the credit unions, so are the community banks, just as the banks overseas. So, I just want to be clear about that. But listen, we have \u2013 you go through the relationships that we have with the big U.S. banks and it\u2019s hard to say you trade our position with anyone\u2019s in the marketplace. And is that something we have to earn every day? Absolutely. Are things like V.me, things that actually solidify those relationships? Absolutely. There is a lot more that we\u2019re doing working in partnership with banks of all sizes to create that partnership orientation away from a vendor orientation. We view it as something that it's not a god given right, we got to earn it every day. But again just to end where I started is we\u2019ve got relationships with these banks. We don't take them for granted, but like anything else, we work \u2013 we come in everyday to figure out how do we make them better?\nOperator: Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan: Hey, great. Thanks, Charlie. Welcome to the call. Just thinking about your initiatives being more flexible partnering and customizing. I\u2019m curious, to accomplish this do you foresee more investments required to get there or that was in place? And I also wanted to ask just about, your comment about working closer with the merchants. I know Visa has been moving closer to the merchant for some time and given your background from the issuer side. How much closer can Visa get to the merchant before you, I guess, complicate the issue of relationship, if you follow up question?\nCharles W. Scharf: Let me do that one first. I\u2019m not at all worried, did I say worried, I always worry to the extent of, we all should be careful and clear. So, just assume that\u2019s the case. But in my conversations with issuers, we all agree because they\u2019re in the exact same spot. And I speak as much from where I came from as where I am, that we all need to do a better job of working with merchants. Our customers are merchants and acquirers. We\u2019ve got that. We understand that. But ultimately there\u2019s someone who uses the payment product, and there\u2019s someone that accepts the payment product. And if the person that accepts the payment product is not particularly happy, that\u2019s not a good thing for us. And that\u2019s not a good thing for the issuers either. So, we are in total alignment on changing the nature of those relationships where they\u2019re wanted. And it's something that we do -- that we\u2019re working on in partnership with them, as well as partnership with the acquirers. We've had very open conversations with the acquirers about that. I was just with them, with all the big acquirers this past weekend, and they\u2019re totally supportive of it. So, I\u2019m not -- again assuming that we do this openly, the right kind of way. I think we\u2019re all in this together. And your first \u2013 the first part of the question.\nByron H. Pollitt: Yeah, Charles I\u2019ll take the first one. So, the first question I think Tien-Tsin was more about in our effort to be -- have more tailored and flexible client relationships, do we expect this -- is that going to cost more in terms of capital? And I would say, at the current point in time, the big capital is in creating the products and in the capabilities that allow you to operate and leverage a large network, and that today, is there expense involved in tailoring? Yes. But we don\u2019t have line of sight to larger expense. And a good example of that would be our strategy of recognizing, as Charlie said earlier, that the single largest open to buy on the planet is the Visa cardholder's access through our network. Hence, part of our strategy is to build products that can be accessed through our network with common stacked APIs that make it very easy for users or our clients to hook into the network. So, in the spirit of how we're expending our capital, I would say over the next several years its past is much more a representative of prologue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Brendler of Stiefel Nicolaus. Your line is open.\nChristopher Brendler - Stiefel Nicolaus & Company Inc., Research Division: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wondered if you could just give us any color on the progress you're making with Interlink, any sense of how much success you're having with PAVD and actually getting transactions routed over that signature Visa Network on the debit side, as well as any update there may be on the FANF fee? And then maybe for Charlie along with the FANF fee, is there anything in that comment you made about being closer to the merchant and working with the merchant that would make future implementations of fees like this go a little more smoothly? Thanks.\nByron H. Pollitt: Let me take that one to start to on Interlink. If you go back to the third fiscal quarter of 2012, that was the quarter April 1, was when the dual network Durbin requirement became effective that was high tide in terms of Interlink payment volume loss. So, our growth rate in that third quarter was minus 54. If you then move to the fourth quarter, so that's the fourth fiscal September ending quarter, the growth rate for Interlink was minus 48. If you then move to Q1, so the December ending quarter, were minus 44. And so these -- clearly, we're going to have one other kind of major quarter of transaction loss through Interlink, because it takes four quarters to lap the Durbin effect, but you can see 54, 48, 44, there is progress. Having said that, there is going to be -- as we said all along, there is going to be a significant permanent transaction loss as a result of the Durbin regulations. And so while we would expect to continue to make some progress, there is no way we're going to get back to where we were before. And then as I had mentioned in my remarks, once we get into that third fiscal quarter, then the growth rate picture should start looking very different with regards to our debit business, because we're now lapping Durbin. With regards to PAVD, PAVD is up and operating. It's important to note that a transaction that is a PAVD transaction actually shows up in our Visa debit payment volume not Interlink. And so PAVD is up and operating. You should think about it at best contributing very modestly to our payment volume growth in U.S. debit. And with regards to FANF, and remember FANF is one part of a much more comprehensive fee restructuring, which was combined with a lowering of our per transaction cost, in addition to the introduction of merchant incentives to encourage routing, which is still on the upward ramp. FANF has now been in place since the April quarter. And so far it seems to be going well. Charlie, do you want to add anything?\nCharles W. Scharf: I guess the only thing I'd add is, listen, I think it's unfair and it's hard to try and stick yourself into the position of someone else when you're going through what this company was going through. And so, I have not personally sat and gone through exactly what happened, what was the thought, what were the options, I mean all the things that you would do to answer your question directly, I haven't done because I'm looking at the future here. But as I said, I think as we -- and I think we're all in the same page internally on this one is just as we look forward which is the important thing here, I mean it's about balancing everyone's issues and it's balancing issuers, it's balancing those with merchants, with acquirers, with our own. And we're going to be very, very conscious of that. We're going to do the right thing whether it creates noise or not, but make sure that everyone's represented in that discussion before we make a decision.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nDon Fandetti - Citigroup: Good evening. Charlie I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you view sort of the longer term threat from China UnionPay? And then maybe talk a bit about how you see the sort of opportunity in China playing out and what your approach will be to that market?\nCharles W. Scharf: Sure. I was in China, I don\u2019t know two or three weeks ago and had the opportunity to meet with a couple of senior members in the government with some of our big clients with China UnionPay and do some, and participate in some other activities that we\u2019re involved in socially there. China is an interesting place for sure, we\u2019re over there. We make money there and we have got some great partners there. The WTO ruling speaks for itself. Over time that market will evolve and will change and we feel like it\u2019s important for us to be a good partner to people within the country to bring the benefits of Visa to China. In my conversations with people there, they want us there. They think we can add value not just because of the brand, but because of what our network is versus maybe what China UnionPay is today. And we\u2019d hope over a period of time that we can work with China UnionPay in the context of the way the regulations exist today and as that market changes and evolves. We will figure out how we can do more inside that country, just as they look beyond that country as they develop. But again, I come back to what we have. Our network has been around for a long time. We\u2019ve got 2 billion cards? That\u2019s the number? 2 billion cards outstanding. The largest open-to-buy, the quality of the fraud tools, I mean, I can go on and on about what our network has, and if there is another competitor out there, so be it. Good competition is a good thing, not a bad thing.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Hi. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. Charlie, when you think about investment in the business aside from products and so forth. How do you think about market share, I think particularly in the U.S. which is the most mature market in which you operate from an electronic payment standpoint; and should we consider an effort to bolster share both on credit and debit as a central component of the investments going forward as well?\nCharles W. Scharf: Yeah. So listen, I said this before, which is, our number one opportunity is cash. So, we\u2019re constantly -- the first thing we look at when we think about share is we think about the share of cash versus electronic payments. And it's our goal, it's our mission, it's what we do for a living is to move that number towards electronification. For all the reasons I talked about, it's just -- it's the right thing and it's a good thing for all the participants in the market place. And so, I know everyone likes to always ask questions, I mean, even my old job; they used to ask how you compete against the other competitors out there? We've got great competitors. They are doing some neat things. They are smart people. So, I think first and foremost given the market we\u2019re in, there\u2019s plenty of room for a bunch of us to be successful here. And so, that is -- the enemy first and foremost is cash. When you look at how we\u2019re doing versus competitors; we looked pretty good; pretty happy with it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.\nCharles W. Scharf: Tim, if you\u2019re there; you\u2019re on mute. Can\u2019t hear you.\nTimothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities: Sorry about that. Thanks for pointing that out. Can you hear me now?\nCharles W. Scharf: Yes.\nTimothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities: Yeah. So, on the regulatory front, as you\u2019ve traveled the world, it sounds like over the last several months. Could you give us your thoughts on what kind of regulatory and political environment that you have to navigate; how you think that would impact the economics of your emerging market growth versus how your economics look in the more established markets and if you\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised or find out to be more challenging as you assess what you\u2019ve heard over the last couple of months globally?\nCharles W. Scharf: Yeah, I would say -- first of all, it's very different in different parts of the world. And so, you obviously know about the U.S, you\u2019ve read about Canada, you know about Australia presumably, and really is different depending on where you are. Again, I alluded to this in lots of my remarks when we started, but I was really positively taken aback by the desire for government officials to want us to be in the market committed to helping electronify their payments. It doesn't mean that they're not concerned about interchange or they're not concerned about figuring out what they want in country versus not. I mean different countries have different points of view on that. But they want us to be a participant. They see the value in that. And again, this is not -- this wasn't me going around the world trying to sell our services. This was me going to meet people and as part of that, the clear message to me was we want you here. And when you're in that kind of situation, that's a pretty good place to be in. Byron, anything you want to add?\nByron H. Pollitt: It is a wonderful dynamic. There are always two doors in the government. The first door is always open with an open invitation. You can't tax what you can't see. Hence, there's a very strong motivation for governments to be very interested engaged partners. And then I would say the other piece is our position and others when we get deeply involved in the electronification of payment, we become an important part of the monetary system or can be in a country. And that's why in virtually every major market we have government relations representatives, we engage early, we educate, we lay good groundwork so that these dialogues are constructive and increase the probability of a good reinforcing regulatory environment as we lay the foundation for growing in the domestic markets of these emerging markets.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Your line is open.\nRobert Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Thank you and welcome Charlie. Your bar is a lot higher than Joe's was. Your stock's trading at 21 times earnings, his was nowhere near that when he started. So, given that bar and given that this looks like such a great story even just why the valuation has done what it has, what do you view? What are you most worried about? What are the biggest risks? What can derail this train? Is it something like a PayPal offline and MCX, other countries like India, RuPay going the way of China UnionPay? What are you most worried about, what can derail this, what has been a great story so far?\nCharles W. Scharf: So let me just go through a couple of thoughts. First of all, I would say focus, knowing -- being clear who our clients are and not isn't extremely important. We get a lot of pressure from a lot of people to use our assets to go do things and whatnot. And so my comments around knowing that our clients are the issuers and the acquirers is extremely important. We change the nature of those relationships. We put a lot of money in jeopardy at this place and potential future growth. Regulation and legislation clearly has been a big issue for the industry. We're very, very conscious of it. You can't be here and not be. Hopefully, some of the things I talked about when I talked about the priorities, over time with things that get to those issues, because ultimately if you've got the people who are participating in the payment system wanting to do business with you, as opposed to the opposite, then you don't get some of the pressures that you see. Again, competition is competition. I mean there's some great competition out there. I wouldn't trade our position with other people. It doesn't mean that we don't think about them, it doesn't mean that people don't do some really smart things, that we sit there and we say why them and not us, that's always the case in every business. But hopefully, they're sitting there and thinking more so of us. So, we spend a lot of time talking about both the traditional and the non-traditional people. So for sure we worry about it, but ultimately that one -- as sitting here today, we feel like we're in a good place.\nJack Carsky: Brad, at this point we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Hi, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of questions. I guess, Charlie, on the strategy, how do you feel about the risk of being dis-intermediated either through ACH or through another player especially as we move into more of a mobile world? And then secondly for Byron, just the rest of world payment volumes kind of spiked in the quarter. Just curious to know if that was supplemented by some new wins that pushed that number higher. Thanks so much.\nCharles W. Scharf: Sure. On dis-intermediation I talk about competitors, traditional, non-traditional and that encompasses a wide range of people. So, again we think about it. We worry about it. What we hope people would look at over a period of time, and what we think people look at over a period of time is, our assets that we have here is really hard to build. It just is. The global connectivity, the acceptance that we have, the actual network the way I described it, and other people have other assets out there that they bring to the party. And, what we should be doing, and are doing, and will do more of is engaging with that community to figure out how they can get access to our network in a way which is friendly to our customers because, ultimately it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to go build something that we already have. It doesn\u2019t mean people won't try. It doesn\u2019t mean they haven\u2019t tried in the past. But again, I keep kind of saying this; it's up to us to prove to people why our asset is as good as we think. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do.\nByron H. Pollitt: And Bryan, on the international PV up-tick in this quarter, for reasons that are not -- that aren\u2019t clear other than the tension that we had around China and Japan, and mostly in Asia Pacific around that impacted the Chinese, the Japanese, Korean cross-border travel as tensions over Island ownership spiked. And everything from the Senkakus to the Diaoyus to the Spratleys, there seemed to be a more broad-based malaise in that quarter. And the recovery, if I can call it that or the rebound was very broad-based. It's still down. And that \u2013 in that [pocket] of Asia where the \u2013 where that tension existed last quarter, but there\u2019s been more of a broad-based uptick. So, it's not win specific, it's more a broad-based uptick. And remember for us, that\u2019s the world excluding Europe.\nJack Carsky: And with that we\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any follow-up calls, feel free to give Investor Relations a call. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our Web site. With that, I'll turn the call over to Byron.\nByron Pollitt: Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, as you can see from our earnings press release, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis based on the litigation accrual we took in the wake of the $450 million escrow deposit we made in late September. As a reminder, this litigation provision is covered by our retrospective responsibility plan. The $450 million additional litigation accrual has been estimated off of recently completed settlements with selected opt-out merchants representing approximately 3% of the total opt-out merchants based on sales volume, as well as the status of negotiations and discussions with other opt-out merchants. Excluding this litigation accrual, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.18. In addition, consistent with past practice, the company\u2019s funding of the $450 million litigation escrow deposit had the same effect as a share repurchase, as it reduced the Class B share conversion ratio by an amount equivalent to buying back 2.1 million Class A equivalent shares at $215 per share. As a result, at the end of the fiscal year, we had 618 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. We continued to experience solid constant dollar payment volume growth in the low double-digit range both in the U.S. and internationally. U.S. credit continued to strongly perform, led in large part by Chase portfolio conversions. That said, looking ahead to fiscal 2015, our near-term outlook remains cautious given the modest pace of economic recovery, the geopolitical situation, Ebola, low currency volatility and continued FX headwinds from a very strong U.S. dollar. Turning to revenue. As expected and previewed on our call last quarter, revenue growth for the fiscal fourth quarter rebounded growing 10% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis or 9% nominally, which reflects about 1 and 1.5 percentage points of FX headwind in the quarter. For the full fiscal year, revenue growth was 10% on a constant dollar basis and 8% nominally recognizing close to 2 percentage points of FX headwind for the entire fiscal year. A word on international transaction revenue. Revenue growth for the quarter was 4% compared to 9% nominal growth in the cross-border payment volume. The difference can be explained by the continuation of historically low currency volatility discussed last quarter. That said, we saw an uptick in volatility across a basket of currencies in September, which continued into October. While we remain cautious in projecting this metric, results in September and October are encouraging. Client incentives for the fiscal fourth quarter came in at 19.2% putting us right on target with our full year guidance of around 17%. As we telegraphed on last quarter\u2019s call, the elevated level of incentives was the result of key renewals in Canada and CEMEA which completed in fiscal Q4. I\u2019ll speak to fiscal 2015 in a moment. Lastly, as always, we remain confident in our future growth prospects and full committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, in Q4, we committed $1.2 billion to reduce the number of Class A equivalent shares by 5.7 million at an average price of $213. This was accomplished through open market purchases and as noted earlier, a deposit of $450 million in the company\u2019s litigation escrow account. Further, our Board approved in October a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization that in combination with the 682 million remaining from the prior authorization gives us 5.7 billion to deploy in the coming quarters. We also recently announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.40 to $0.48 per share. This level of increase is consistent with our previously stated objective of a 20% payout of the previous fiscal year\u2019s net income or in this case adjusted net income. Now let\u2019s turn to payment volume and transaction growth. Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 11%, slightly down from the June quarter. The U.S. grew 10% and international grew 13%. Drilling down further, for the September quarter, U.S. credit was 13% slightly higher than the 12% in Q3 in part due to Chase conversion activity. Through October 21, U.S. credit improved to 15% growth. U.S. debt was 7% in Q4, a 1 percentage point downshift compared to Q3. Through October 21, U.S. debt is back up at 8% growth. Taken together, U.S. payment volume growth through October 21 was 11%, up 1 percentage point from the Q4 level. Global cross-border volume delivered a 10% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter, up nicely from 7% in the June quarter. The increase was attributable to stronger activity across a broader set of travel corridors with some effect from the timing of Ramadan. Notably, there was a nice pickup in travel to the EU from the Middle East, China and Australia. The U.S. grew at 7% and international grew at 11%. Through October 21, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis held steady at 10% growth with U.S. growth at 6% and international registering 11% growth. Underperforming travel corridors includes several countries in Latin America along with Russia and Ukraine. Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled 16.9 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 9% increase over the prior year. The U.S. grew 8% while international delivered 14% growth. Through October 21, processed transaction growth improved to 11% growth rate, up 2 percentage points. The U.S. grew 9% while international grew 15%. Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, a 9% increase year-over-year driven primarily by growth in service and data processing globally and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by about 1 and 1.5 percentage points of foreign currency headwind. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was 8% over the prior year or growth of 10% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the individual line items for the fiscal fourth quarter. Service revenue was 1.5 billion, up 8% over the prior year and was driven by moderating global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year\u2019s quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions both in the U.S. and internationally. The delta between the quarter\u2019s 9% processed transaction growth and the 14% revenue growth was largely due to higher year-over-year growth in U.S. debt fees implemented in 2012. Of the delta, approximately one-quarter was due to lapping a one-time refund of an overpayment in Q4 of the prior year. The balance is ongoing as this fee structure stabilizes after having been implemented two years ago. As highlighted earlier, international transaction revenue was up 4% to $938 million versus 10% constant dollar cross-border volume growth over the prior year period, as a result of a broad range of currencies experiencing volatility well below the 10-year median. In contrast to the year-ago quarter when volatility was near record highs, we are hopeful for a return to a more normalized volatility pattern in the coming quarters. Turning to other revenue, it showed a slight uptick in the quarter reflecting a true up of the Visa Europe licensing fee, some of which was catch-up. Initially, the licensing fee was $142.5 million annually. The annual rate for fiscal year 2015 will be around 148 million. Excluding the litigation provision, total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, flat from the prior year. For the full fiscal year, adjusted operating expenses were also flat to fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating margin was 62% for the fourth quarter and 64% for the full fiscal year both in line with our guidance of low to mid-60s. Capital expenditures were $227 million in the quarter and 553 million for the full fiscal year. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 623 million and 631 million for the full fiscal year. Before I speak to specific items of guidance, let me provide some early perspective on how we see the timeline of fiscal full year 2015 playing out. We approach 2015 bullish on the long term, given the underlying strength in payment volumes and processed transactions and cautious in the short term. Here are some of the underlying observations and assumptions in forming our planning for next year. First, while we expect U.S. and international payment volume growth to remain healthy, we have not yet seen acceleration in global economic growth. Cross-border volumes are rebounding as we reported 10% growth in the quarter but this is still below the low double-digit levels we experienced at this point last year and so we remain appropriately conservative in positioning this metric. As a perspective, we know that these growth rates can recover without notice and that the notable declines in Latin American growth rates lap in January of 2015 and the market declines related to the Russian-Ukraine crisis will lap in March. Everything else equal, once these events anniversary, the pickup in cross-border growth could be in the 2 to 3 percentage point range. As to currency volatility, as I said earlier, while we have seen a bounce in September and October, we are not sure how sustainable this is. Turning to a different subject, we will be taking selected pricing actions commencing in April of 2015 on certain U.S. acquirer fees, which will result in higher revenue growth in the second half of our fiscal year. Given that we have not taken actions in this area in four years, we believe the length of time and the substantial value these cross-border transactions bring to merchants make a modest adjustment appropriate. In addition, based on recently completed significant client renewals that Charlie will speak to in a moment, as well as the successful growth in client payment volumes for both issuers and merchants, we will see higher levels of client incentives as measured by a percent of gross revenues with the highest percentage levels expected in the first half of the year. In dollar terms, quarterly incentives in fiscal 2015 should be more indicative of the $700 million plus level seen in fiscal Q4. Finally, consistent with past practice, we expect to deploy our excess cash flow in 2015 to service our recently increased dividend and to continue to repurchase our shares. To sum up, in terms of guidance for fiscal 2015, we are contemplating constant dollar revenue growth of low double digits with 2 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact. Absent any catalyst, we see our constant currency growth today at the very low end of the double-digit range. As previously stated, our guidance contemplates several pricing actions to be effective at the beginning of fiscal Q3. This means our year-over-year revenue growth rates are expected to be double digit in the second half and in the mid single-digit range in the first two quarters as we lap low levels in incentives in the prior year. Turning to client incentives, as a percentage of gross revenues, we expect it to be in a range of 17.5% to 18.5%, operating margin in the mid-60s, full year tax rate in the low 30s. On tax, as a reminder, when viewed quarterly on a year-over-year basis, the tax rate in Q2 of fiscal year 2014 was significantly reduced due to a tax benefit recognized under IRS Code Section 199 that included prior years along with an ongoing benefit. Turning to earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, mid-teen growth and annual free cash flow in excess of 6 billion. Lastly and before I had the call over to Charlie, I wanted to address the topic of cross-border growth. In my conversations with analysts and investors, there have been a number of questions raised regarding our cross-border volume growth rate. In that light, on a one-time basis, we thought it would be useful to provide some incremental perspective, which we have included on Page 3 of the appendix of our PowerPoint presentation. During our earnings report out each quarter, Visa includes in its operational performance package its cross-border volume growth rates on both a nominal and constant basis, excluding Europe. The first two columns show what we have historically reported in the operational performance data pack. The third column is new and represents a global view of Visa including Europe on a nominal basis to facilitate competitive comparisons across a common geographic footprint. The next two columns also include Visa Europe and present cross-border growth rates recognizing there are at least two different methods for calculating those growth rates, which can have very different outcomes. When Visa historically measures and reports cross-border growth in constant currency, it uses the year-over-year change in exchange rates for the country currency and which the merchant transaction took place. Those growth rates are presented in the fourth column labeled merchant country. Alternatively, one could also calculate cross-border growth rates using the currency representing the country in which the issuer resides. Those cross-border growth rates are presented in the fifth column labeled issuing country. Of course, other factors can also impact growth rates such as relative portfolio exposure to different countries and their currencies, the method for selecting FX rates and translating back to the U.S. dollar and share shifts, but those are much harder to isolate and quantify. Recognizing the complexity of this topic, in addition to the one-time slide, we have provided an illustrative example of a cross-border transaction and the effect it can have on growth rates depending on the underlying methodology employed. You will be able to find it on our IR Web site located with the other earnings-related materials and that will be posted at the immediate conclusion of this call. We will then be available for follow-up conversations if you would like further explanation. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharles W. Scharf: Thank you very much, Byron, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I thought I\u2019d start with just a couple of brief thoughts on our fiscal fourth quarter. As Byron went through, our performance came in pretty much as we would have expected; adjusted earnings per share growth this quarter of 17% and 19% for the full year. As we think about it, it\u2019s actually gratifying given the continued subdued economic environment globally and the volatile geopolitical environment which do affect our business. It says a great deal about the business itself and the company that we\u2019re lucky to be able to be a part of here. Revenue growth continued to be constrained by the strong dollar, the low currency volatility compared with historical norms and cross-border growth below historical levels. As Byron mentioned, we believe that these items that have constrained our revenue growth are cyclical and can change very quickly. More importantly, we really spend most of our time looking at the underlying fundamentals of the business and they continue to perform very well. In constant dollars, our double-digit payment volume growth with particular strength in the U.S. in addition to double-digit cross-border payment growth. Processed transaction growth was strong as well. As Byron mentioned, these trends improved slightly in October through the 21st. Beyond our data through the 21st, our ability to see the future is the same as yours but we\u2019re cautious about the global growth as we plan for next year. Just a couple of comments about capital now. We\u2019ve been very consistent as a company in how we think about capital allocation. We continue to believe the highest and best use of our excess capital is to reinvest it both organically and through acquisitions to further our growth. After that, we believe in growing our dividend as our earnings grow and maintaining a payout ratio of about 20% of our trailing earnings. We will opportunistically return the rest of our excess capital through share repurchases. In 2014, we did all of these things; investing both organically in the business, outside investments. As Byron mentioned, we effectively bought back 4.6 billion of our stock during the year. And as we look forward, we remain committed to continuing our practices. Last week, our Board approved a 20% dividend increase from $0.40 to $0.48 a share per quarter and they also approved a new $5 billion share repurchase program in addition to the roughly 680 million remaining from the prior authorization. Given the opportunities in the payment space, we will continue to look for and prioritize growth opportunities, but our Board\u2019s actions should give you an indication of how we feel about our opportunities to grow in the future. Let me talk for a second about Russia. Russia continues to move towards its goal of controlling domestic processing. Last Tuesday, President Putin signed modifications to the national payment system law, which positions the Russian Central Bank owned national payment card system as the preferred domestic payment processor. The law delayed the implementation of a guaranteed deposit from the end of October 2014 to March 31, 2015 to allow for an appropriate transition. When the national payment card system is utilized, there is no guarantee deposit requirement. We\u2019re working closely with the government and our clients to ensure a smooth transition. We continue to expect to lose a portion of our domestic processing revenues in fiscal 2015 of about $50 million. This is likely to grow up to about $70 million on a full year basis when fully implemented. We continue to believe we\u2019ll play an important role in Russia. Once this transition occurs and our baseline is reset, we will continue to focus on helping our clients grow both domestically and internationally. With that, I will talk for a second about our client franchise and just talk about some of our most significant markets, especially some of the things, which do create lumpiness in our incentives as we look forward into 2015. First, let me start with Russia. We continue to work with our clients to support their businesses. We recently signed multiyear agreements with several Russia banks including Sberbank, by far the largest issuing bank in Russia. In the United States, we continue to have great success. We renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with the Bank of America, our second largest client globally. To put this into perspective, if BofA were a country, it would be one of the largest in the world for Visa. Our agreement provides the opportunity to grow our share from our prior agreement and we\u2019re thrilled with the relationship we have with the Bank of America. Remember, when we signed our 10-year agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase, they agreed to move the majority of their non-Visa volume to Visa. These conversions have begun and are going extremely well. Per Nielsen, total expected volume to convert has been estimated at over $40 billion. It\u2019s a bit less than 10 million cards overall and the conversions are expected to be completed by February 2015. In the U.S. credit market, we continue to gain share and remember this is the largest driver of our profit in the world. Canada is one of our other large countries. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve signed long-term contracts with issuers and partners representing over 85% of our business including Scotia, CIBC, RBC, TD and Aeroplan. Visa\u2019s Canadian issuers have invested heavily in new rewards programs for Canadian consumers driving very strong growth and we benefit from these great partnerships that we have. Brazil is a complicated market for us given the elections and the recently implemented cross-border taxes, but we continue to grow our relationships there as well. We\u2019ve renewed a multiyear credit and debit and commercial agreement with [CAHSA], the fifth largest issuer and we renewed a multiyear credit, debit and prepaid agreement with Banco do Brazil, our largest issuer in Brazil and the Latin American region. Just a second on co-brands, which seem to be getting a lot of press these days. First just as a reminder, we think we have the best and we have the largest co-brand platform in the world with seven of the top ten programs exclusively Visa and great partners outside of the U.S. as well. This quarter, we renewed a multiyear credit agreement with Gap. We\u2019ll continue to be the payment brand and network for the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy co-brand cards and our partnership with Gap extends beyond the retail store environment. Websites for the Gap and its family brands are now offering Visa Checkout as an online payment service. In addition to the deals that we\u2019ve announced today, we\u2019ve agreed to terms to move a significant consumer credit co-brand from a competitor to Visa. We look forward to sharing more about this as cardholder plans take shape. We\u2019ve talked a bunch about bringing new capabilities to market for merchants and in addition to what we are doing in Visa Checkout, we are continuing to start to rollout products for the merchants. Last quarter, we forged a proprietary relationship with TrialPay and had a small team from TrialPay join Visa to lead the development of a new product platform designed to help our merchants acquire more customers and sales opportunities. TrialPay is one of the leaders in presenting consumers relevant merchant offers during a transaction and we\u2019re using their technology and experience together with all of the capabilities that exist at Visa to build the platform that will drive millions of new customers to our merchant clients. You\u2019ll be hearing more about this in the coming months. We rolled out a new product called Visa Transaction Advisor in August. It\u2019s a new solution, which helps U.S. fuel retailers prevent credit and debit fraud at the pump. This service enables merchants to use real-time authorization risk scores to identify transactions that can involve lost, stolen or counterfeit cards. More than 65 million transactions per month are being reviewed by the service at 25,000 locations across the U.S. Some merchants have seen a 23% reduction in fraud at participating locations. Merchants using this service include top U.S. brands such as Shell and Chevron. These are just the beginning of our focus on directing our capabilities towards merchants. Just say a few words about payment security and U.S. chip cards. At this point, most people understand most of the benefits that we get from moving from magstripe towards chip-enabled cards, but there are also some important unappreciated benefits just what I want to highlight. Approval rates, again this is in the U.S., of chip cards versus magstripe are 97.9% for chip cards versus 92% for magstripe on cross-border and 99.2% for chip cards versus 98.4% in domestic transactions. Today, only 3.6 million terminals at 55,000 locations accept chip cards; 19.8 million Visa cards are in circulation, up 56% from 12.7 million but still a very small number relative to the total cards that are outstanding. Having said that, we assume most people have read issuers, acquirers and merchants are working diligently to increase these numbers dramatically. The payment security taskforce that we participate on with a series of other people in the industry put out a press release that said that acquirers representing 80% of U.S. purchased volume estimate that at least 40% of U.S. merchant terminals will be chip-enabled by the end of 2015. The group also reported that nine of the country\u2019s largest payment issuers estimated that they would issue more than 575 million chip-enabled cards by the end of 2015. There are also estimates that over 90% of cards will be chip-enabled by the end of 2017. Turn for a second and just talk about our digital efforts, which are a huge focus for us inside the company. This quarter, we\u2019ve started to see some tangible progress as we have begun to introduce new digital solutions into the marketplace. First, a reminder that online purchased transactions for us are 19% of our business today and also that in the U.S. online, tablet and mobile purchases are growing at high double digit to triple digit rates versus a face-to-face rate of single digits. We are aggressively pursuing this market with the expectation of growing our share. We\u2019ve seen several things to support this; Visa Checkout, Visa Token Services, Visa Digital services and Apple Pay. First, let me talk about Visa Checkout. Remember, this is our solution, which enables you to pay online in a very simple, secure way with a username and password. It\u2019s easy and secure for consumers and it\u2019s a terrific solution for merchants. It\u2019s easy to integrate and it\u2019s been proven that it increases the checkout floor rate for merchants. We continue to make great progress. We passed 1.9 million registered users, over 200 financial institutions are partnering with us to roll this out to their clients and merchant reaction has been terrific. Merchants live today include Neiman Markets, Pizza Hut, Staples, 1-800-FLOWERS, Ticketmaster, Live Nation, Lululemon, Petco and Popsugar. Other new merchants who were live include the Gap and its brands, Tory Burch, Gymboree, Crutchfield and Orbitz and more who have signed but have not yet gone live included United, Virgin America and American Apparel. Hopefully many of you have seen the advertising both in traditional media as well as digital and social with great partners such as Pizza Hut, Neiman Markets, Newegg and Staples. We intend to win and love the fact that we\u2019re partnering with merchants to drive Visa Checkout as a preferred solution in online commerce. To increase our region scale, we also integrated two partners; 3DCart and ProPay that provide access to a combined total of over 100,000 merchants. In addition, our merchant acquired partners such as First Aid and (indiscernible) are integrating Visa Checkout for both their core platform and subsidiaries. As we evaluate our progress, we\u2019re focused on addressable online volume not the number of merchants and are very happy with our progress. To-date, over 33 billion in live addressable volume accepts Visa Checkout, another 30 billion has been signed and we\u2019re very confident that these numbers will be much larger as we get to the end of 2015. In early September, we announced the launch of Visa Token Services. We talked about this a bunch, so I won\u2019t dwell on it. But it enables all Visa clients to offer their cardholders a secure and easy way to pay for mobile and online transactions, as well as it enables new forms of payment which are more secure that exist today. Apple Pay is the first used case in the market but many more will follow. We\u2019re excited about Apple Pay but for us as we think about what\u2019s going to be coming into the marketplace, it\u2019s only the beginning. We expect a proliferation of exciting mobile and digital solutions leveraging our new capabilities. In October, we launched our sandbox development and testing environment for Visa Digital services as well as updated our SDKs that will enable issuers to begin embedding new forms of contactless payments in their Android applications. Eventually, merchants and approved third parties will be able to harness the safety and security of Visa payments to create new proximity payment experiences for their uses. These services will be commercially available in the U.S. in January of 2015. Clients have already begun integrating to our development environment and our building and testing their applications in advance of our full commercial launch in 2015. As far as Apple Pay goes, just a couple of quick comments. We\u2019re excited about our participation. We believe it\u2019s good for consumers, it\u2019s good for merchants and it\u2019s good for our industry. Our focus has been on security, scalability and inclusiveness. To the last point, we\u2019re working with over 1,000 financial institutions today and hope to see all of our issuers participate. On Monday, Tim Cook announced that over 1 million cards had been loaded to iPhone 6s in the first 72 hours. Visa represented over 600,000 of those requests; early days but very encouraging.  And then just a note for us to be able to deliver all of these differentiated services in the marketplace, we continue to build our engineering and technology capabilities. To that end, we announced that we plan to add a 1,000 technologists and engineers in the U.S. This is in addition to the 1,000 that we\u2019ll be hiring into a new facility in India, which will open in 2015. Just to wrap it up before we open it up for questions, let me just say a couple of other things here. There\u2019s been much talk about disruption in payment and what it means for us. Most of the disrupters are great enablers for consumers, merchants and our industry. Apple is the first great example. We and our clients can be great enablers of great consumer and merchant experiences. We bring thousands of banks, millions of customers and a convenience security customer service rewards and other great features that consumers like. You\u2019ll see many other enablers evolve that we will partner with and we\u2019re doing this all in support of our existing clients. As we look to the future, we continue to see great growth opportunities for payments. We have our traditional channels and traditional ways of doing business, but we sit here today and we see the mobile opportunities in both the developing, the less developed and the developed world as being great drivers of our mission, P2P, commercial and our merchant relationships as all things that we\u2019re going to focus on to continue to build our business. With that operator, I think Byron and I are ready for questions.\nOperator: Okay. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. With regard to client incentives, you talked about those being first half weighted in fiscal '15. Can you talk about how many of your top 10 issuing clients are renewing this year? And do you expect all those renewals to happen in the first half of the year given the frontloading that you talked about earlier?\nByron Pollitt: Byron here. So of the top 10, I would say one is scheduled to renew this year. And the frontend loading is really a function of two things and it\u2019s not what you just described. It\u2019s really a function of the deals that we most recently completed. We had a heavy deal flow that came to completion in Q4 and then will begin working their way through the fiscal year '15. But also as we have commented on many times before, incentives can be very lumpy in the way that they unfold. And so in the way that the deals were executed and we expect a frontend loading of incentives with regards to the P&L and then the guidance that we have given on a full year basis fully contemplates the lumpiness, so to speak, and we expect to deliver full year incentives somewhere in the 17.5% to 18.5% range.\nJim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.\nCharles W. Scharf: The only thing \u2013 this is Charlie \u2013 that I would just add is that also keep in mind that client contracts sometimes renew off cycle and that\u2019s contemplated in our guidance as well.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nCraig Maurer - Autonomous Research: Hi. Thanks. Two questions. First, if you could comment on the apparent announcement out of the Chinese government this morning that they\u2019re going to move to open up that market for additional settlement clearing networks for bank cards? Secondly, a technical question on Apple Pay. We\u2019ve noticed that American Express is able to provide real time transaction alerts whether these are Apple Pay transactions or any other swipe, you\u2019re always getting an alert. On Chase transactions, which you\u2019ve provided a bespoke version of Visa, they don\u2019t seem able to provide this service. It would seem that Chase is not fulfilling the promise of that transaction that you had entered into with them or am I missing something? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf: Okay, let me do the second part first. So first of all, just to be clear, when you complete an Apple Pay transaction, there is immediate notification on the device itself that shows you that the transaction has taken place, the dollar amount and who the merchant is. You can then effectively flip the card over and see the running tally of all of your transactions. So, there is no \u2013 at least from our experience, my personal experience, there is no lack of clarity whether or not you\u2019ve completed transactions and it is very real time. The question about whether people are then providing additional alerts on top of that, that you got to talk to your individual bank about. We offer a service, which we provide to a series of banks out there that do allow for real-time alerts. I can tell you I personally signed up for it and I get it on as real-time basis as you can expect. But different banks choose what they want their consumer experiences to be. But having said that, again, it exist in real time on the Apple device. As far as China goes, there\u2019s really not a lot more to talk about than what you\u2019ve read, which for those who haven\u2019t read it, there was an announcement today that the Chinese government will open up the market to competition in our business. We don\u2019t know anything specific other than that. We obviously welcome it and we look forward to seeing the specific details and working with people within China to figure out what we need to do to participate in that marketplace where we believe we can add a lot of value.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller - Barclays Capital: Thanks, guys. Look, following a year where revenue growth ended up being a little more challenged than expected given some of the cross-border trends being slower, it\u2019s obviously nice to see the end of year pickup in those trends. But I guess following up on the guidance, if you can help us understand the assumptions you\u2019re making around a couple of different attributes includes volume growth versus the way it\u2019s trending in October as well as what part of this is from pricing, just because we\u2019re getting a lot of questions on how much pricing can actually impact the overall top line guidance of low double digits? Thanks, guys.\nByron Pollitt: So the headwinds that we had this past year, many of them still continue into this year. Our currency volatility we\u2019ve guided \u2013 we didn\u2019t actually expect to guide to two full percentage points of FX headwind a second year running, but particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past two months has now made that much more likely. We were thrilled to see cross-border beginning to bounce back but it\u2019s too early to call that a trend. With regards to volume, it\u2019s based on low single digit constant dollar growth in volume gains, low double digit. And with regards to pricing, we don\u2019t go in \u2013 it\u2019s not our practice to go into the details of pricing but we have guided that it will take place in Q3 \u2013 beginning of Q3. So this is very much second half weighted and we also indicated in our guidance that we would expect to, with that pricing boost, be in double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year.\nCharles W. Scharf: Let me just pick up on that. As you\u2019ve heard from both of us, we know what we know. We don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. But we look at what\u2019s going on in the world and as we plan the company for next year, we have a cautious point of view of that. And so our cautious point of view suggest that we don\u2019t plan for very big increases in things driven by what\u2019s going on in the outside world. Albeit we know that they will improve at some point. We don\u2019t know when, but we think it\u2019s prudent to plan otherwise.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital. Your line is now open.\nDan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow back up, Charlie, on your 19% online. I guess it\u2019s volume or revenue, I need to get clarification of that, but the question really is that sounds like that piece of business is growing somewhere around three times faster than what you referred to as the face-to-face business and I\u2019m just wondering if you could give some sort of characteristics around how should we be thinking about revenue yields or all the products that you\u2019re going to be able to put around that type of volume, it sounds like there\u2019s more pricing opportunities in the future with those types of transactions and maybe what we\u2019ve seen on a legacy basis? And then just for level setting, Byron, is it 907 plus the mid teens that\u2019s the guided number or are we adjusting for the second quarter last year benefit? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf: So on the first piece, what I referenced in my remarks was really to talk about two different things. Number one is we have a big business in the online world today and the way we think about it is we\u2019ve been remarkably successful in a world where we haven\u2019t had great products to compete. We also stand back and we look at the growth and the growth rates of transactions done online, on tablets and on mobile are multiples of what\u2019s done face-to-face. So we both have a defensive reason to do it, but more importantly an offensive reason to help that migration and to participate in it. So the things that we\u2019re doing from Visa Checkout to Apple Pay to the things that are going to be \u2013 using our Token Services and our Digital Solutions are all about having the best products in the marketplace to capture where the growth is, which is in the digital channels. Relative to what it means for us from a pricing perspective, again we\u2019ve been very, very consistent on this which is we\u2019re not sitting here today thinking about this as an opportunity to capture more price. We\u2019re looking at this as an opportunity, one, to both be where the natural growth is but two, to help migrate all those cash transactions whether they\u2019re big value transactions or small value transactions into the electronic space where we\u2019ll hopefully capture more than our fair share. We do have a pricing schedule for our tokenization services. We said we\u2019re waving those fees for a year and we\u2019re going to see how this all plays itself out. But again, we look at this as this is the future of commerce, we want to be there. We see that there will be more volume in that world than there is for us sitting in the world that we are today, and if we make this up on volume as opposed to price that\u2019s just fine with us. If there are pricing opportunities in the future, we won\u2019t look the other way but that\u2019s not our reason to do this.\nByron Pollitt: To you second question, Dan, the short answer is 907 and the perspective is you were with us at the very beginning when we did our IPO. From the very beginning part of our investment thesis was that we would manage down the tax rate every single year to the best that we could. We started out at 41%. We said we\u2019d manage it down to below 34%, 35% over about five years. We didn\u2019t stop at five. We have continued to manage our tax rate. We have never adjusted or provided any EPS guidance that adjusted for a full year tax rate, because that\u2019s just one of the levers we have to manage the business and we will continue to do so. So it\u2019s mid teens off of 907.\nDan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets: Excellent. Thank you.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nDon Fandetti - Citigroup: Yes. Charlie, I was just curious your thoughts on the U.S. market. I mean we\u2019re seeing some of your large bank issuers put up some loan growth. Consumer confidence has picked up, but we\u2019re not really seeing it in the spend. I was just curious on your outlook and just want to confirm that there\u2019s no real improvement baked into guidance in the U.S.?\nCharles W. Scharf: Byron walked through some of the recent trends. Our performance in the U.S. credit market is strong but we don\u2019t look at it as \u2013 or let me say it differently. Certainly, in a really good performing economy should look much better than it looks today and we\u2019ve not factored that into our thinking for next year.\nDon Fandetti - Citigroup: Okay. Thanks.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Thank you. I got a question on client incentives. Understanding that you guys had a big renewal in 2015, but how should we think about its trajectory looking ahead to 2016 and 2017? Are there large renewals coming up? And then just one clarification on the assumptions embedded in the guidance. Currency volatility as it stands right now, is that a tailwind in 2015 and are you assuming no tailwind? Thank you.\nCharles W. Scharf: With regards to client incentives, from the beginning we \u2013 in fact going all the way back to the IPO, we have always viewed client incentives on an upward trajectory recognizing that the typical client contract is five years and that when a client contract comes up for renewal and if they have been successful, as most are, nearly all are in growing their portfolios, then the level of incentive adjust to a higher level recognizing the growth over the previous five years or whatever the term was and that\u2019s the way the businesses worked forever. In addition, client incentives were \u2013 back at the IPO we\u2019re much more a developed market phenomena and as the rest of the international group of countries have grown, we have applied client incentives more regularly to those multiyear contracts. And so there\u2019s a natural and healthy and expected upward trajectory in client incentives. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s to the extent that we have one big renewal next year or this fiscal year, that\u2019s not driving it. What\u2019s driving it is what I\u2019ve just described.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: It drives the lumpiness, but not that trajectory.\nByron Pollitt: That\u2019s very fair. It drives the lumpiness but not the upward trajectory. And then your \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, your second question was\u2026?\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Currency volatility.\nByron Pollitt: Yes, so on currency volatility \u2013 boy, this one\u2019s tough. No one saw last year coming. It was at historically low levels. We\u2019re quite sobered about how to think about that and it would be very consistent for us to say that we have approached currency volatility with a high degree of caution and as Charlie said earlier, we absolutely know what we don\u2019t know about how currency volatility will behave in the future. So, as I said before, we were very pleased to see the September and October bounce. We didn\u2019t see it coming but we\u2019re pleased to see it happened, but we remain very cautious in our guidance with regards to the roll of volatility in the coming year.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Brendler from Stiefel. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Brendler - Stiefel Nicolaus & Company Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. I wanted to get a little more color, if I could, Charlie, on the pricing you mentioned in April. I think Byron also was saying about cross-border. Is this a similar pricing action to what one of your major competitors did on inbound cross-border? And if it is, does that change your thinking at all on how you wanted to view pricing? And I think we had talked about in the past that this is a situation where you are drawing a line in the sand and saying we\u2019re going to be independent in our pricing decisions and price for value. Just give me a little more color on that. And then a follow-up, if I could on union pay. It seemed like the articles are focused more on clearing rather than the entire food chain in the payments business of authorization and settlement. Can you give us a rough idea how much clearing is of total Visa revenues? Thanks.\nByron Pollitt: Why don\u2019t we start with the second one?\nCharles W. Scharf: The union pay and clearing.\nByron Pollitt: Yes.\nCharles W. Scharf: I don\u2019t have the answer. I\u2019m not sure \u2013 so the way we charge for our services, we charge service fees in data processing. And if we process the transaction then we reap data processing fees and that number is on our income statement and service fees if our brand is on the card. We can\u2019t sit here today and know what China is contemplating when they talk about opening up the marketplace quite frankly. But we really have to wait and see what they say and then understand what it means for us. Beyond that, we really don\u2019t know any more than you know at this time. Then the second one on pricing, why don\u2019t you start on pricing.\nByron Pollitt: So on pricing, I can say absolutely this was an independent decision. And as I said in my remarks, it has been four years since we have done something in this arena. Meanwhile, we have continued to invest in the transaction environment related to cross-border and in our domestic markets. And at some point we cross the line and say the value created for both our issuers and our merchants warrant a modest change in pricing which is what we\u2019ve taken.\nCharles W. Scharf: And we\u2019ve said very consistently and I\u2019ve said it consistently and Byron said it consistently, there is no line in the sand any which way that the decisions are going to stand on their own and we have to look people in the eye and explain why they make sense for us in the environment that we live in and we booked this one for a long time and feel it\u2019s the right thing to do.\nChristopher Brendler - Stiefel Nicolaus & Company Inc.: Great. Thanks so much for the color.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies & Co. Your line is now open.\nJason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.: Thanks, guys. From what you see in your data, are lower gas prices in the U.S. sparking consumers to spend more actively in other verticals or are the lower gas prices just a drag on volume without any real offset? Because I guess we might have thought that the U.S. volume growth in the September quarter may have accelerated versus June, just given the Chase conversion, but it looks like it was pretty steady. So I\u2019m just wondering if there was a dampening effect from lower gas prices or what you guys are seeing there?\nCharles W. Scharf: So this is a story that is undoubtedly going to unfold a bit. There is no question that there is a modest drag that we see in the numbers with the drop in gas prices. It\u2019s less than 100 basis points but it\u2019s clear there is a drag. You saw debit growth, which carries a lot of the gasoline transactions. You saw debit growth drop to 7% in the September quarter, you saw it bounce back to 8% through the first 21 days of October. But the data is still a little unclear whether that is spend that\u2019s being redistributed or in the prior year, if you may recall from October 1 through October 16, the government went into a partial shutdown and arguably depressed some spending during that period. And so this particular comp period is not clean. But the thesis that we punch way above our weight when it comes to gasoline prices, use of cards at the pump works on the upside. It also can be a drag on the downside. Then the big question is how is that money redistributed as it frees up, and at this point too early to call.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan Keane - Deutsche Bank: Hi. It\u2019s Brian from Deutsche Bank. Just looking at the data processing revenues growth at 14% and I think volume at 9%, one of the things that you talked about Byron was the higher U.S. debit fees, some pricing that kicked in. I just want to make sure I understand what that was. It sounded like there was a pricing kick that finally is having an impact in 2012 with three quarters of it still going to have an impact. I just want to make sure I understand what that is. And then finally on the pricing in April 2015, you guys expect \u2013 can you quantify that impact and where it will show up in the P&L? Thanks so much.\nCharles W. Scharf: With regards to the data processing fees, to be absolutely clear there were no pricing actions in this area. This is about the pricing structure that we implemented back in 2012 and it was a \u2013 as you recall, it was a very different pricing structure than the one that we had previous to that point. And whenever you do that, it\u2019s going to take a couple of years to stabilize as you work your way through the full and complete implementation of that structure. That\u2019s what it is. It involves no price increase or no pricing action. And what I referred to earlier in my script has nothing to do with what you\u2019re seeing. And further this kind of stabilizing should have a positive effect in the next couple of quarters but diminishing and by the end of the fiscal year should be in our view pretty much stabilized. With regards to the other since we\u2019re not yet public on the details of the pricing, we will wait for another day to consider addressing that.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore Partners. Your line is now open.\nDavid Togut - Evercore Partners: Thanks for taking my question. Could you address your pricing strategy more broadly over the next two to three years, perhaps gauge your pricing power and to what extent you intend to use it?\nByron Pollitt: Sure. I would say there\u2019s nothing new in our thinking which is first of all when we think about our ability to grow the company for the long term, given what the opportunities are for us to grow volume, using pricing to get to numbers that we hope to be able to show over a period of time is not something that we rely on. Having said that, we do think we should be paid fairly for what we do. And to the extent that we look at the services that we provide and feel that there is growing value in what we do, that\u2019s an opportunity for us to consider raising price. We know that people have options and so there has to be reasons to be able to do it whether it\u2019s on the issuer side or on the merchant side. And as I\u2019ve talked about before, we\u2019re spending a lot of time working with the merchant community on providing value for them. And as we do that, some of those things will result in things that will help us from a pricing standpoint. Other things support our existing price. So everything we do will be dealt on an individual basis. There is no line in the sand in any way we look at it. But again, as we come into the year and we think about what the opportunities are, pricing is something that we think is tactical for us and not particularly strategic at this point.\nJack Carsky: We have time for one last question.\nOperator: Okay. Our final question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open, sir.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research: Thank you. I wonder \u2013 could you give us an update on what\u2019s happening with CyberSource? Still pretty good growth in transactions, but the growth rate continues to slow?\nCharles W. Scharf: Yes. So as we\u2019ve said \u2013 I\u2019d be happy to give you an update. We\u2019re not happy with the update. As you\u2019ve noted, the transaction growth has been slowing and as we\u2019ve said on an earlier occasion, we missed an investment cycle. We are now investing significantly to catch up both in our capabilities and our staff. You should expect the anemic growth, so to speak, to continue for at least another couple of quarters. We expect that that will begin to turn around by the end of this fiscal year. And then just one callout. The measure we give you is transaction growth. The transaction growth that we have lost has been among the least revenue generating of our transaction. So the revenue growth side of the equation has held up much better than the deterioration in transaction. But that said, we\u2019re not happy with the results but we have a very important role for CyberSource to play in our strategies going forward and we are investing aggressively to bring that back to a much stronger growth rate.\nJack Carsky: With that, we want to thank everybody for joining us today. And if anybody has follow-up questions, feel free to give Victoria or myself a call. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participation.

All participants are in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer session of today's call. Today\u2019s conference is also being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Charles. Good afternoon everybody and welcome to Visa's earnings conference call today. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our website prior to this call. Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today\u2019s press release. This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.\nByron Pollitt: Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, we continue to experience solid constant dollar payment volume payment volume growth in the low double-digit range both in the US and in internationally. That said, we see no signs yet of any acceleration in economic recovery and cross-border volume growth remained soft in the mid-single-digits. Turning to revenue, as expected and previewed on our call last quarter, revenue growth further moderated growing 7% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis or 5% nominally which reflects the two percentage points of FX headwind we have experienced since the beginning of the fiscal year. As a reminder, the current Q3 is lapping 17% nominal revenue growth in the prior year quarter which benefited from a number of favorable one-time adjustments. It is worth noting that the international revenue grew it only 1% this quarter despite cross-border constant dollar volume growth of 7%. While unfavorable FX is a partial explanation, the bigger impact is the significant reduction in currency volatility which has a direct impact on our international revenues. We expect both of these factors to reverse overtime. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect a rebound in nominal revenue growth on the order of 2 to 3 percentage points compared to Q3. This rebound is about 2 percentage points than we anticipated at the time of our last earnings call primarily due to a 1 percentage point drop in cross-border transaction growth and unusually low levels of volatility across a broad range of currencies. So, that means for the full fiscal year 2014, we now expect revenue growth in the 9% to 10% range on a constant dollar basis with guarded optimism that the moderation in cross-border volume growth has dropped. After FX impacts that translates into nominal revenue growth of 7% to 8%. Client incentives for the fiscal third quarter came in lower than we had anticipated at our last earnings call due primarily to the timing associated with several major deals which have now been either signed or we expect to sign in the fiscal fourth quarter. With this in mind, we are narrowing our full year guidance for client incentives as a percent of gross revenue to around 17% from the prior range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Let me also point out that mathematically this puts the fourth quarter at north of 19%. In terms of EPS, on a fiscal year 2014 basis, we are narrowing our guidance for diluted earnings per share to be in the 17.5% to 18.5%. Lastly, we remain confident in our future growth prospects and fully committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of $5.6 million shares during the quarter at an average price per share of $207 in change resulting in a total cost of $1.2 billion. This leaves an outstanding open to buy of $1.9 billion at the end of June and as always we will take advantage of market movements to repurchase at attractive prices. Now, let\u2019s turn to payment volume and transaction growth. Let me start with what I stated last quarter though we are seeing a sustained economic recovery, there are no signs yet of acceleration either domestically or internationally. Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars was 11%, a 1 percentage point decline from the March quarter, the U.S. grew 10% and international grew 13%. Drilling down further for the June quarter, U.S. credit growth was 12% slight improved to 14% growth. U.S. debit was 8% in Q3, a 1 percentage point improvement compared to Q2 through July 21st, U.S. debit is flat at 8% growth. Taking together U.S. payment volume growth through July 21 was 11%, up 1 percentage point from the Q3 level. Global cross-border volume delivered a 7% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter slightly down from 8% in the March quarter. U.S. and international both grew at 7%. Through July 21st, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis held steady at 7% growth with the U.S. growing 6% and international registering 7% growth. For the June ending quarter, the sequentially downtick of 1 percentage point in cross-border was broad-based and spread across China, Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina and the Middle East as you might expect, given political tensions and the early on-set of Ramadan. Speaking of Ramadan, when interpreting to Q4 cross-border trends keep in mind that the timing of Ramadan in 2014 benefits August at the expense of July.  Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled $16.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an 11% increase over the prior year period, same growth rate as Q2. The U.S. grew 9% while international delivered 20% growth. Through July 21st, processed transaction growth moderated to a 9% growth rate. The notable drop in July is largely due to the lapping of significant debit wins in Brazil in June 2013 where our debit processing penetration went from zero to well above 50%. Now, turning to the income statements. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in service and data processing globally and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by a 2 percentage point foreign currency headwind. Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.4 billion, up 9% over the prior year and was driven by moderating global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.3 billion, up 11% over the prior year\u2019s quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions both in the U.S. and internationally.  As highlighted earlier, international transaction revenue was up 1% to $860 million versus 7% constant dollar volume growth over the prior year period, as a result of a broad range of currencies experiencing volatility well below the 10 year trend line in contrast to the year ago quarter when volatility was near record highs. We would expect a return to a more normal volatility pattern in the coming quarters. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, down 3% from the prior year. Certain expenses have slipped to the fiscal fourth quarter while some specific personnel and professional fees those sequentially higher than the prior quarter were comping off of higher levels of the expense in the year ago period. We expect elevated marketing investments in the Q4 more comparable to Q2 levels tied to the FIFA World Cup in combination with significant investments in the support of the recent rollout of Visa Checkout. Operating margin was 64% for the third quarter, in line with our annual guidance of low to mid 60s. Capital expenditures were $109 million in the quarter.  At the end of the June quarter, we had $624 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled $628 million.  Finally, given our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, let me recap our 2014 full year guidance. Constant dollar net revenue growth of 9% to 10% which when combined with 2 percentage points of negative FX impact; yield nominal revenue growth of 7% to 8%. Client incentives around 17%; operating margin in the low to mid 60s; tax rate between 30% and 31%; EPS growth in the 17.5% to 18.5% range and free cash flow of about $5 billion. Before I turn the call over to Charlie, let me provide some early perspective on fiscal 2015. In short, we are approaching 2015 bullish on the long-term but cautious in the short term. Here are some of the underlying observations and assumptions in forming our planning for next year.  First, while we expect U.S. and international payment volume growth to remain healthy, we have not yet seen acceleration in global economic growth. Cross-border transactions appear to be troughing in the 6% to 7% growth range on a constant dollar basis. As a perspective, we know that these growth rates can recover significantly without notice and that the notable declines in Latin American growth rates lap in January of 2015 and the market declines related to the Russian-Ukraine will lap in March, everything else equal once these events anniversary to pick up in cross-border growth could be in the 2 to 3 percentage point range. As the currency volatility, not sure when this trend reverses. We only know from an historical perspective we are overdue for a correction and such shifts and trend can be quick and sizable. Consistent with past strategies, we remained focused on growing revenues for converting more cash volume to electronic payments with a growing emphasis on digital. In addition, we expect the successful growth in our client payment volumes for both issuers and merchants to result in higher levels of planned incentives as measured by percent of gross revenues. Turning to Russia, while this situation is still very much influx, we anticipate being a part of a commercial solution that will be implemented in 2015 which will likely resolve in the loss of about 50 million in domestic Russian processing revenue. Looking further down the income statement, we see no step function change in our tax rate at this time. That said, we are working diligently on a more fully realizing our opportunities related to foreign tax credits. Finally, consistent with past practice, we expect to deploy our excess cash flow in 2015 to service our dividend and to repurchase our shares. In sum, we remain bullish on the future but recognize that in today's economic environment we must work through several challenges before we can once again resume more normalized rates of growth. As is our practice on the Q4 earnings call, we will provide more color on 2015. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharles W. Scharf: Thank you very much, Byron. Byron did cover the financial results in a fair amount of detail but I just thought I'd just pass on a few quick thoughts. First of all, the quarterly results did come in where we expect. The revenue growth being impacted by the year-over-year comps with the strong U.S. dollar and the tepid growth from cross-border payment volume in these specific geographies was what we expected. And we reiterate that we are confident that these headwinds we do not feel are permanent. More importantly for the long-term, global payments volume and processed transactions remained healthy and strong. Also our issuer contract pipeline is very strong. So, all in all we are gratified to be able to deliver 50% earnings per share growth given the environment and what we've discussed. Let me turn out for a second and talk about Russia. As you all know by reading the newspapers and watching the news, the situation continues to evolve. The recent additional sanctions have not forced us to curtail business with additional clients and as of today, our domestic and international business continues. This concludes completing term sheets and contracts regarding our brand relationships during this quarter with significant Russian clients which we're gratified about but we continue to focus on developing a domestic processing solution and we're actively engaged with the Russian government and the Russian banks to develop a commercial solution which will allow us to continue serve our Russian clients. Most limiting provisions of the new law going to effect in October and we are working to have a solution implemented by that time. Having said that and as Byron mentioned, we do expect to lose a portion of our domestic processing revenues over the next year which will reset our base from which we expect to achieve good growth. Now, let me turn for a second and talk about what we're seeing in our client activity around the globe. We did have a good quarter regarding issuing co-brand contracts just a few significant examples. In U.S. we renewed our credit card relationships with the American Eagle Outfitters and high hotels and resorts.  In Canada earlier this month, we launched a new relationship with CIBC for Tim Hortens which is the largest QSR in Canada. It's a significant co-brand offering and a no fee rewards space reported by innovative product features and real-time awards. It's called the Double Double Visa Card, it leverages the first of its kind dual button technology that combines a CIBC Visa Credit Card for payments with a classic Tim Card for rewards. Cardholders simply press CIBC Visa button on the front of the card to pay for their everyday purchases anywhere Visa accepted or they can choose to press the Tim Card button and then use the same card to redeem their Tim cash for their favorite coffee and menu items at Hortens. New card is also, also offers the convenience of Visa payWave and the security of chip and pin technology that consumers in Canada enjoy today. On the issuing side, we also renewed a multiyear agreement with the Royal Bank of Canada an important and long-standing client of Visa. We also signed a number of other significant new multiyear agreements around the globe. In Australia, we will be the exclusive card net worth for a Woolworths money credit card partnership. Woolworths is Australia\u2019s larger retailer. In China, we renewed our credit partnership deals with China Industrial Bank, China Minsheng Banking Corporation, and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. In Korea, we signed a new debit partnership agreement with [Pona SK] and a new credit debit agreement with [Woori] card. In Saudi Arabia, the Saudi British Bank will convert their debit card portfolio to Visa from a competitor and bank Saudi frenzy has renewed their credit, debit and prepaid agreement. In the UAE, Visa signed new credit deal with Mashreq Bank including an exclusive card for high net worth individuals. Turning to CyberSource for a second. We have discussed the weaker growth over the past few quarters increasing our rate of growth here it will take some time it\u2019s one account at a time and as Byron mentioned we are investing here to rebuild the higher growth rates. We recently announced a strategic global partnership with Amadeus, a leading technology provider for the global travel industry. Amadeus has integrated CyberSource's fraud management system decision manager into the Amadeus payment platform which can help travel organizations globally accept more bookings while identifying potential fraudulent transactions and lowering operational costs. Turning to payment security for a moment, earlier this year we formed a payment task force in partnership with other networks, merchants, issuers, acquirers and device manufacturers. We see real collaboration here which is terrific. We continue to work through a common roadmap for enhanced security in the U.S. topics include EMV, tokenization, end-to-end encryption and coordinated communications. The Group is working very well together and we would expect the Group to have some things to talk about publicly in the near future. Let me talk for a few minutes now about our work in digital commerce. First of all, there is a lot of clutter in the market about who is doing what in the digital payment space. It can be confusing for sure. We have a very specific point of view and a set of strategies here. Simply put we are keenly focused on achieving the same success in the digital world that we have had in the physical world. This mean focusing on tangible activities in the marketplace that help accelerate digital commerce with Visa as a platform partner. As in the side our card not present volumes today are growing three times as fast as card present which we feel is still just a fraction of the opportunity in this space. We are focused on two different but related things.  Number one, bring digital payments to the physical world and number two, enabling digital payments in the connected world. To do this, we are materially changing how we do business. Historically we would only allow access to our capabilities through issuers and acquirers and for them it wasn't particularly easy. Today we're simplifying access for our traditional partners but we're also enabling a much broader set of partners to access these platforms in ways we have not allowed historically so, they can build experiences that use our payment of capabilities. This includes partners such as merchants, technology companies both big and small, mobile operators, device manufacturers, other payment companies, social networks and the broader application developer community. Including these partners means exposing web services so they can connect with us. To help drive innovation, last week we opened a 100,000 square feet of innovation center in San Francisco. The space is all about collaboration, it\u2019s one of a series of physical spaces which we will have, which provide a physical environment where we can sit side-by-side with partners traditional and new big and small to create experiences using our capabilities. We're also investing in younger companies such as DocuSign and [Loop]. As a group investments like these and there are more to come keep us close to innovators in our space. Being part of the dialogue is important. Bear in mind, we are not looking to pick exclusive winners here, but we do want to enable a series of people who we think can help drive payment electronification. To support our digital activities today we announced Visa Digital Solutions. This suite of services extends our support for mobile payments to enable retailers, financial institutions and developers to create new ways to pay via mobile devices. Specifically, we published specifications in software development kits to make it easier for financial institutions, merchants and developers to create new ways to pay using our products on mobile devices using Visa payWave and QR codes.  We have also published APIs and SDKs to enable merchants and developers to embed simplified payments within their web and mobile sites as well as the mobile applications using Visa Checkout which I\u2019ll talk a bit more about in a moment. These services are now available and there will be more coming throughout the year. The second category is aimed at protecting consumer account information. Our new token services are part of this. I\u2019d mentioned this before but most people are focused on the security benefits of tokenization and they are real. But with tokens new players and importantly non-traditional payment providers such as developers and merchants can build applications that access payment information in a safe secure manner not possible before. This means on digital devices wherever there is an Internet connection regardless of the form factor including ones that don\u2019t exist today. Developers will be able to integrate Visa payment capabilities. Merchants, developers and banks will start offering token-based payments in September of this year. We are also launching a more robust developer center in early 2015 but we\u2019ll extend the capabilities we exposed to the developer community.  In addition to all of this we\u2019re creating a suite of services to enable banks to issue and manage Visa accounts and secure \\virtual clouds. This again allows developers to create commerce opportunities to integrate our payments products and capabilities wherever there is an Internet connection. Last week, we launched Visa Checkout replacing V.me in the marketplace. We've learned a lot over the past year and a half through candid conversations with issuers, acquirers and merchants. In addition to consumer research on the topic of digital wallets and digital acceptance. Our goal is simple, we want our clients and their customers to be able to use our products in the digital world as easily as they can in the physical world. This means we\u2019ve designed Visa Checkout to be the Visa Card in the digital world that means a simple buying experience for consumers, clear branding for issuers and simple integration with merchants, it also means preserving the roles in the payments chain as they exist today. Visa Checkout accomplishes all of this.  For the consumer they can pay with the username and password with just a few clicks whatever they see their card and Visa Checkout online. For the issuer clear branding throughout the Checkout experience and for the merchant easy integration of a product one which will help increases the rate at which sales are consummated online. As I said Visa Checkout is simply a Visa Card in the digital world.  As I mentioned earlier with this launch a new mobile software development kit is also available allowing developers to quickly build and implement an in-app Checkout experience for iOS and Android based devices. We will drive broad awareness for Visa Checkout through a significant advertising campaign recently launched in the digital and social channels and on television later this year. The campaign will feature participating merchants and a broad range of consumer offers and promotions. We\u2019re thrilled with our partners who are part of the launch. On the financial institution side they include more than 180 financial institutions and organizations, big and small, the list includes U.S. issuers such as Bank of America, BB&T, BBVA Compass, CSCU which is the card services for credit unions, Chase Citi, ICBA Bank Card, Navy Federal Credit Union, PMC, Regions, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.  We\u2019re also thrilled to have great merchants as partners in our launch some of which are following Neiman Martins, Staples, Pizza Hut, United Airlines, Petco, Wine Enthusiast, Adorama, Jos. A. Bank, Rakuten, Ticketmaster and Live Nation, over 170 merchants are live in Australia, Canada and the U.S. representing approximately 20 billion in total addressable payment volume. The sales pipeline is also very strong with over 40 merchants at term sheet and or negotiating master service agreements representing an additional $37 billion in addressable volume including some great sizable brands.  In summary, our job at Visa is to help pro-commerce by providing a platform to integrate but we think is the best payment brand instead of capabilities in the world into new buying experiences simply and securely. These experiences will certainly make it easier to pay by eliminating physical cards overtime but the driver of behavioral change will be the experiences that can now be created on mobile devices that cannot be created on plastic, because the mobile device is connected and interactive and these experiences will become the real reason to pay digitally overtime.  We believe that you will start to see these experiences in the near future and are excited about what they mean for everyone involved in commerce and will be an important part of our future. We look forward to discussing these specific experiences and their positive impact to Visa over the coming quarters. And with that operator, I think Byron and I are ready to take questions.\nOperator: Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nJason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.: Thanks guys. Just wanted to ask about the cross-border little bit more since obviously that remains a high priority focus area for folks. Can you give us any commentary whether some of the slowdown has been more on the consumer side relative to the commercial side? And then just any thoughts on the gap between your growth in this metric and that of your biggest competitor? At least through the March quarter we don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve done for the June quarter. But it just looks like that gap has gotten little bit bigger. I\u2019m curious if you guys have done any market intelligence to get a better understanding of that, and is there anything structural there we should be thinking about?\nCharles W. Scharf: So let me start off with the first part of the question. It\u2019s very corridor specific. So let me just highlight a few of the corridors that we saw the deceleration in cross-border from Q2 to Q3. And many of these will come as no surprise. Generally from Russia to the European countries, from Argentina, Venezuela to the European countries. The European countries to Ukraine, Russia to Ukraine, Ukraine to the European countries. So from that standpoint those are the key quarters that moved the needle. We know that it is pretty broad based and in this case many of these are just situationally specific. With regards to second part of your question, recognizing that Visa, Inc. does not have Europe. We are comfortable that at least half the difference in cross-border growth rates is attributable to Europe and the remainder we have under study. We also know given the ebb and flow of certain portfolio movements that some of that is country-specific and we are very focused on reversing those trends in the coming quarters.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you sir. Our next question comes from Sanjay from KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: Thank you. I guess I had a question on the hedges and the volatility observation or point. Could you talk about what would happen if volatility doesn\u2019t come back into the FX market? I mean, does that serve as a headwind for period of time then?\nCharles W. Scharf: So let me separate hedges and volatility. Because the two are completely independent to each other. When we speak of hedges this is simply basically a 12 month program where we try and dampen the fluctuations in FX when we translate net revenue or earnings positions earned in foreign currencies back in to our financial statements. Cross-border is impacted but to a modest degree and these are hedges in the traditional sense, simply in put in place to dampen the volatility of naturally occurring changes and currencies relative to the dollar overtime. The volatility is a different animal. Every year, if we look back over the past year, we will have performed currency translations services for over a $150 billion in value in order to facilitate the settlement of transactions where Visa Card is -- whose account is denominated in one currency is used in a country where the currency is different and so over the course of the year as I indicated we do over $150 billion of those kinds of currency translation services.  The way we earn a very small spread on those transaction. The way the spread is calculated, it's an algorithm that is based on the actual volatility of our currency in a given day. Those that volatility is something we have studied over a long period of time. There is during the course of a year often quite a bit of volatility but the amount tends to revert back to a mean overtime. So we would expect what we're seeing and as example if we were to look at the month of June, June had the lowest volatility that we have seen in 15 years. So from that standpoint we view this much more as of the moment that it should resume back to sort of normalized volatility levels which has been our experience since we've gone public. And that's how we're anticipating this trend for the future.\nJack Carsky: Our next question Charles.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jim, Jim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your commentary regarding incentives for the fiscal '15. Specifically how many of your top 10 issuing clients are expected to come up for renewal next year?\nCharles W. Scharf: So, what we would typical do on the Q4 call is give you a sense of the full year expectations for incentives so you can expect that on the Q4 call in October. It is our practice to give incentive projections or guidance on a yearly basis not by quarter and we would characterize our pipeline of deals as it was healthy this year. It's a healthy pipeline of renewals next year as well and the impact -- the expected impact will characterize that in a range and share with you all on the fourth quarter earnings call.\nJack Carsky: Next question, Charles?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital: Thanks. Charlie just first a higher level question. I mean you mentioned in your remarks, I think in the press release that longer, you believe Visa should be able to grow the revenue in the double-digit range, can you just highlight and perhaps rank for us what the key drivers you think would be that would enable the growth to improve given the higher base which we're growing now? And then maybe just near term, on the near term side Byron is a follow up to that question I mean I guess what people are trying to figure out is if there is higher level of incentives in fourth quarter is actually new business that could drive that part of that acceleration next year? Thanks guys.\nCharles W. Scharf: Yeah. So, let me start with -- start this which is -- again the way we look at our numbers, as we look at what our revenue growth is excluding the items that we talk about here as headwinds. And again I said this in my remarks, we do believe that these headwinds are not permanent and so if you just look at the headwinds that we've had far in the foreign currency translation and the currency volatility, the impact on the comps year-over-year and this growth in cross-border payments which we should point out can move either way very, very rapidly and we've got amazing data to back that up. When you just back out these headwinds which we do believe are temporary, our growth underlying all that is still very, very strong which you can see in the transaction processing growth and the overall payments growth. So, as we -- so we talk about generating reasonable returns over a period of time, there is the long term which is affected by the things we're doing in the digital world we think which is certainly helpful but then there is this other defined period once we get through these headwinds and the issue that we have is we don't know exactly when they are going to reverse but we're very confident that they will.\nByron Pollitt: With regards to the second part of your question recognizing that a typical contract with last five years some longer. We entered into contracts with the expectation that they will drive growth over that five year period. How we structure the incentives makes a big difference with regards to what kind of growth we may or not see in the first quarter as we've talked about over the years, some of the deal renewal entail more meaningful upfront payments that from a gap standpoint we might have to record more fully in the income statement versus amortize over the term of the contract. And so there is a lot that goes into how you structure deal and then how it\u2019s translated onto the books. But since Charlie\u2019s comment was based over the -- and we see our self in the longer-term returning to double-digit revenue growth, the answer is we would expect these deals to build on a foundation that would drive growth over the term of the period that what enabled us to achieve that objective.\nJack Carsky: Next question Charles.\nOperator: Yes, sir. And next question comes from Moshe from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks. Charlie when you talked about tokenization, could you talk about whether that is something that is going to kind of bring revenues into the system and will those be revenues that go to the networks did they share I mean could you talk a little bit whether those are they just going to be something that\u2019s going to an additional form of security?\nCharles W. Scharf: Yeah, I don\u2019t think the answer which is yes it\u2019s an additional form of security for sure. We think of it as driving more network volume that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to get because other people can now participate and embed payments in different applications and experiences out there because it\u2019s safe and secure because of the tokens. This isn't a question of getting paid specifically for tokenization. It really is about driving more volume through our issuers or merchants and ultimately to us as well as part of that.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Smitti from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSmittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you. Charlie I just wanted to follow-up on a statement that you made earlier about your new strategy on the digital front, I\u2019d thought I heard that you say you allowed new ways for parties to access your network directly so, does that mean eventually merchants and other technology partners will no longer need to connect your network through in wire? And if that\u2019s the case well settle the transaction?\nCharles W. Scharf:  No, I didn\u2019t say that, what I said was that that we are exposing the capabilities so that different parties including merchants can embed Visa payments into their experiences but very importantly it preserves the role that issuers, acquirers play in the system today. So, what we're trying to do is again historically we've had great relationships with issuers and acquirers still do, but anyone who is trying to build an experience for an application would have to then go through multiple issuers and multiple acquirers to get that experience to market in a meaningful way and by exposing our capabilities directly to them, it allows more people to be creative relative to helping drive digital commerce in a way that uses our payments as a platform for them but it keeps the flows of information, the flow of data and the flow of economics the same as it is today in the fourth party system.\nSmittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley: Thanks for the clarification.\nJack Carsky:  Next question Charles.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities: Yeah, I just want to follow-up Byron your comments on \u201915. I didn\u2019t hear any comments on the operating margin do you still expect to get leverage in \u201915 on the operating margin? And then secondly, just an update on the Chase migration volume that is expected are we a quarter way through just trying to get a sense of how much we're through in that migrating of that volume? Thanks so much.\nCharles W. Scharf: The only thing before Byron answer the question, let me answer that operating margin it\u2019s -- we really have to think about incentives as a meaningful cost of doing business here as well.\nByron Pollitt: And the two should be viewed in combination and with the exception of -- what happen to our incentive line after the great recession that has gradually moved up and the activity and a few comments on H1 performance highlighting the most significant points. \nCharles W. Scharf: But even beyond the three months because I think -- the way we think about where we are is we are not in an environment where it\u2019s very easy to predict the next quarter or the quarter after that just given what\u2019s going on in the world and these trends that we\u2019ve seen which affect our revenue numbers materially. Again as I said before, we feel very confident that the headwinds will dissipate. We know that at some point the economy will be more helpful across the globe, what we don\u2019t know is the timing. And we certainly can\u2019t sit here today and tell you what it will be a year from now. And that is still only half way through next year. So as the world evolves and as these issues evolved and we get closer to the time period, it\u2019s obviously by definition easier for us to talk about it.\nByron Pollitt: Just a quick word on Chase. The current quarter\u2019s result to the extent that they include any of the conversions it\u2019s not material. And remembering this will hit the service fee line and we report the service fee line on a one quarter lag. Before we see much impact from the conversion it will really be for us that December ending quarter which will be the first quarter of the next fiscal year. But at the present no material impact on the quarter\u2019s results and frankly not a material impact on the Q4 results either.\nJack Carsky: Next question, Charles?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin from JP Morgan Chase. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to I guess clarify what\u2019s driving the software revenue outlook for the fourth quarter? Just wanted to make sure I caught it correct. It sounds like it's lower cross border plus lack of volume acceleration I don\u2019t think it\u2019s incentive driven. Just wanted to clarify that. And then my -- the question I wanted to ask was actually on Visa Checkout and the strategy there to get consumer signed up and to use Visa Checkout versus whatever PayPal or any other digital payment method you can think of. Because if we get questions all day today about Apple and other initiatives I\u2019m just trying to understand how that\u2019s going to play out versus something else? Thanks.\nByron Pollitt: Okay. So let me take the first part. With regards very specifically to the Q4, which is really how we're then going to finish out the year, it compared to where we were on the third quarter call, what\u2019s different primarily is a downtick in the cross-border, so if you have that right and continued depressed, historically depressed volatility levels from a currency standpoint. And for those were -- our position has moved a bit more conservative from where we were on the prior quarter call. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with incentives because what didn\u2019t get booked this quarter. Our assumption is that it'll get booked in the current quarter. And we're already signing deals to validate that. And remember our incentive guidance was 16.5% to 17.5% and we narrated to about 17%. So we're right down the middle of the fair way.\nCharles W. Scharf: But as we sit here and just think about from this quarter to next quarter we are not assuming any kind of meaningful change in these headwinds that we\u2019ve talked about which again are possible and will happen, we just don\u2019t know the timing and just given the math that Byron said next quarter\u2019s incentives will be higher than this quarter's incentives and he talked about that during his remarks. And the Visa Checkout question. I don\u2019t remember what the exact question was? The question Tien-Tsin are you still there?\nTien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase: Yeah, I am here just wanted to clarify Charlie just in the strategy to get consumers signed up for Visa Checkout versus some all the other stuff that's out there PayPal and I guess Amazon is talking about, just trying to understand how you'll solve the consumer side of equation? And then I guess if I can get a chance here if you can address Apple and iBall or whatever all the press has been talked about with your partnership there I think that would great and how that would fit with, with your digital strategy? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf: Sure, so, listen I think on the answer to the first question about my words is why Visa Checkout for an consumer and how we're going to activate the consumers around the world to use this product as opposed to something else. From our perspective what\u2019s different about this versus the other things that you mentioned are the relationships that we have with banks, right. Again we've got two point 2 billion cards around the world and we think about the people who were willing to support this with their names in the press release, a bunch of them come to a launch event that we had here, these are amazing names. These banks talk to their clients regularly and over the next six months you'll start to see banks do different things to enable their customers in a very proactive way to use Visa Checkout. So, it's one thing for us to sit here and say we're going to try and do it, that would be very, very difficult, the reason why we're confident that will be successful because we do it in partnership with the banks because it's their clients. We provide support. Our marketing and advertising is going to do that again, we've got some really need stuff in the digital and social channels.  As Byron mentioned in his remarks we are going to -- we intend to spend a significant amount in marketing including TV as we go into the back-to-school season and then again for the leading up to the Christmas. So, it\u2019s going to be hard not to know what Visa Checkout and why you should have it and so, we are pretty about that. And Apple I am not going to address anything specifically out there but again we have we have said this before we talked to a whole range of people who historically work doing significant things and payment and those that are and we're very excited about some of the things that we talking to potential partners about and over the next three months, six months, nine months, we hope some of those things will actually be in the market place you will be as excited about as we are.\nJack Carsky: Next question Charles. \nOperator: Next question comes from Bob from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nRobert Napoli - William Blair & Company: Good afternoon. Just wanted to follow-up a few of the 2015 comments. We talk a lot -- you talk a lot about currency volatility, can you maybe put some numbers around is that 1% of revenue effect versus your guidance and then in talking about 2015 your tax rate it was little, the full year tax rate for this year you are expecting it flat and then you are still getting double-digit payment volume growth as people think about revenue and higher as the double-digit payment volume growth do you still expect to be able to attain that next year?\nCharles W. Scharf: Let me start off on the currency volatility we don\u2019t we are not record with talking about specific amounts that this is as you can imagine a part of, it's pretty fundamental to the Visa global acceptance composition that we be in a position to perform currency translation services so, this is something that we have done for ever and we do it in a way that actually delivers a pretty attractive cardholder proposition as a part of the disclosures for someone that receives the Visa Card they are told that they are guaranteed a wholesale rate and I am hard for us personally to think of any other situation where a consumer, a cardholder would have available to them a wholesale currency translation rate. That\u2019s what we do we take a very small spread on that to cover our operations and it's related how much the spread is related to currency volatility and I have talked about that from time-to-time on currency I mean on earnings calls. It rarely has this level of impact but as we said earlier we are at levels of currency volatility that we haven't seen in 15 years tax rate. So, with the guidance of this call we have given very specific guidance of 30 to 31 and have indicated that next year not to expect any step function rate. We did have an important tax adjustment last quarter that represented both a catch up and a permanent ongoing reduction in our tax rate because there was a catch up one might naturally wonder whether that impact is something that would be onetime and then the rate might naturally gravitate back up in the following year. Hence in my remarks I mentioned that we are hard at work and fully realizing foreign tax credit opportunities. And so we expect that to help inform the rate for next year and underpin the comment that we don't at this point expect any step function change in the rate. With regards to double-digit payment volume growth, we certainly on a constant dollar basis this is the level of payment volume growth that is being produced with pretty anemic growth in economies. And so, as we look at the payment volume growth this is one of those factors that we think looking forward have certainly more upside than downside when never knows for shore but one I think would agree that the economic growth we've been experiencing over the past several years has been pretty anemic and hopefully nowhere to but up.\nRobert Napoli - William Blair & Company: Great. Thank you.\nJack Carsky: Next question, Charles?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig from CLSA. Your line is now open.\nCraig Maurer - CLSA : Yeah. Good evening. Charlie, I wanted to ask you theoretically about the future with technology and the changes you're bringing to the online world that are absolutely focused on better securities you said, what are your thoughts about the sustainability of card not present interchange rates for banks when clearly those rates were predicated on higher fraud levels?\nCharles W. Scharf: Listen, I am not going to talk about what we would be thinking about anything specific on interchange on a going forward basis. What I will remind and I know Craig we talked about this but it's always a good reminder to everyone. I don't know a lot of industries out there that price their services for anything other than the value received and the value received from products like ours in the card not present world is extraordinary. And we know the number of businesses that wouldn't that exist if it wasn't for our products. And if people want to go back to a COD world, we can certainly try that. So, as we sit here and continue to improve security and continue to build payments into people applications all with the point of view of helping them grow, we're going to be making sure that we think about looking at both sides of equation looking at what goes to the issuing side and to the acquiring side what is fair in terms of value received. And that could possibly evolve overtime. But again it's the value equation on both sides.\nJack Carsky: Next question, Charles.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Byron I just want to explore one thing on your comment about the Chase business not appearing in the numbers in a material way, just looking at the volume from credit that was 12% year on year U.S. credit. 12% year on year growth in the June quarter and you said I think 14% through July 21st does that reflect any Chase business or is there some other dynamic going on there?\nByron Pollitt: It does but as it relates to conversion it's really not a material driver of those numbers. As the conversion picks up speed later in the year, we would expect to see more of an impact but currently it's not material.\nJack Carsky: At this point Charles, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Ken from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nKenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good evening. Thank you for all the color you\u2019ve given us on the issue around cross-border I am hoping you might entertain one more question. You has pointed out last quarter that some of these quarter headwind is slowing volume obviously there is quarter is going to pick up and it\u2019s going to work out as it works out on the actual foreign exchange volatility side. Has this been something that has been, the volatility is dampening over time and it just became much more acute in the more recent quarter? And if you look back what would be kind of the right reference point just think about in terms of what volatility would look like, if you would?\nByron Pollitt: Honestly, we don\u2019t have a very good explanation. When you look at the patterns, volatility they are often event specific. During the period where Greece was rumored to be potentially exiting the Euro there was quite a bit of volatility in the Euro and that cross referenced against quite a few currencies. We thought that we would see some volatility return during the week where a Malaysian airliner was shot down. We have an event in Gaza and Portugal was in the news with regards to the stability of its participation in the Euro And yet those type of events which would have historically created volatility didn\u2019t. The one common denominator that we\u2019ve seen over the past several quarters is just an exceptionally strong dollar and our hypothesis is that that may have something to do with it. But honestly we\u2019ve done a lot of analysis and look for a lot of correlations and just haven\u2019t been able to find one that offers much in a way of the respectable (inaudible)\nCharles W. Scharf:  But as Bryon said, what we saw recently are the lowest levels that we\u2019ve ever...\nByron Pollitt: In 15 years. \nCharles W. Scharf: 15 years.\nByron Pollitt: So you can gravity for a while but not forever. And so in looking at 15 years\u2019 worth of data there are periods of comp that occur regularly during the course of the year. And then again looking at that timeline of data these can reverse very, very quickly often without notice. And so if past this prolong then it\u2019s just a matter of time before we hit an inflection point and it will go back to something more closer to lead way.\nJack Carsky: And with that we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. And if you have any other follow up questions feel free to call myself or Victoria. Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Adrian. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our Web site. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.\nByron Pollitt: Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, turning to revenue, as expected and previewed on our call last quarter revenue growth moderated during the quarter, growing 9% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis or 7% nominally, which includes the expected 2 percentage points of FX headwind we had been guiding to since the beginning of the fiscal year. As a reminder the current Q2 is lapping 15% revenue growth in the prior year quarter, which benefited from a number of favorable one-time adjustments. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect nominal revenue growth to be in mid single-digits which could be a couple of percentage points below Q2\u2019s growth rate. As signaled on last quarter\u2019s call, a softer Q3 growth rate was also anticipated given continued FX headwinds of 2 percentage points, a 17% revenue comp in the prior year quarter, also driven impart by one-time events and a moderation in cross-border spend which we view as short-term. After two softer quarters in fiscal Q4, we expect to see constant dollar revenue growth more reflective of the secular shift as well as the e-commerce and mobile trends that have driven and will continue to drive attractive growth for years to come. As a footnote to fiscal Q4, we expect very little impact from Chase card conversions, particularly given our quarter lag and reporting of service fees. This event will have more impact in fiscal year 2015. Our guidance for client incentives remains unchanged, despite delivering first half client incentives as a percent of gross revenues of 15.8%, we expect incentives to be second half weighted and finish the year within the current guidance of 16.5% to 17.5%. On a full fiscal year basis, we now expect our guidance of low double-digit constant dollar net revenue growth to be in the 10% to 11% range with a negative 2 percentage point impact from FX. Now let\u2019s turn to payment volume and transaction growth. On a constant dollar basis global payment volume growth was 12% unchanged from Q1. U.S. payment volume growth for Q2 was 8%, also unchanged from Q1. With a boost from Easter timing and better weather U.S. payment volume growth for the first 21 days of April rose to 12%. The deceleration in cross-border growth seems to be bubbling out. Q2 constant dollar growth was 8%, 4 percentage points down from Q1, but the first 21 days of April registered 7% growth nearly flat to Q2. Cross-border weakness is pronounced in Latin America, as in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, the Canada to U.S. corridor and Russia. Visa process transaction growth was a healthy 11% in Q2 and rose to 14% for the first 21 days in April. Taken together we are seeing a sustained economic recovery, but no signs yet of acceleration. A word on Russia and Ukraine, we have clearly seen a drop-off in cross-border volume and sanctions are expected to have some impact on volume. Our guidance assumes several pennies of EPS impact for the fiscal year. We are fully engaged with all parties involved and we\u2019ll continue to adjust our outlook as the situation clarifies overtime. Next callout relates to our effective tax rate for the period. At 22% for the quarter, our rate was positively influenced by the recognition of tax benefits under IRS Section 199 which allows for the deduction of a portion of the income related to U.S. domestically produced computer software. As a reminder, successfully employing strategies to manage our tax rate lower has been a consistent component of our earnings guidance since we went public in 2008 and will continue to be in the future. The total benefit to the quarter was $218 million, $184 million of which represented prior years and $17 million of benefit for each of the first two fiscal quarters. We expect an additional 30 million to 35 million of benefit over the remaining two fiscal quarters and a continuing benefit in future years. Accordingly, we are adding to our guidance for fiscal 2014 a full year tax rate approaching 30%. Please note, this rate was contemplated in our full year EPS guidance for fiscal 2014. Last callout, we remain bullish on our future growth prospects and fully committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of 5.1 million shares during the quarter at an average price per share of $217 and change resulting in the total cost of 1.1 billion. This leaves an outstanding open to buy of 3 billion at the end of March, and as always we will take advantage of market movements to effectively repurchase at attractive rates. Now let me dive a little deeper into the numbers. As noted earlier global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 12%, the U.S. grew 8% and international grew 16%. Drilling down further for the March quarter, U.S. credit growth was 11%, slightly higher than the 10% in Q1. Through April 21st credit improved to 14% growth, U.S. debit was 7% in Q2, flat compared to Q1 and through April 21st debit also improved, rising to 11% growth. As mentioned earlier, global cross-border volume delivered an 8% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter, down from 12% in the December quarter. The U.S. grew 7% and international grew 8%. Through April 21st cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% with the U.S. growing 8% and international registering 7% growth. Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled 15.4 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 11% increase over the prior year period, the U.S. grew 7% while international delivered 23% growth. Through April 21st, processed transaction growth rose to 14%. Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in both domestic and international transactions and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by a 2 percentage point foreign currency headwind. Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.5 billion, up 7% over the prior year and was driven by moderating global payment volume growth. The difference between the 7% reported revenue growth and the 12% growth in constant dollar payment volume is largely due to 3 percentage points of negative FX. Visa service fees are disproportionately impacted by foreign exchange translation, compared to other revenue lines. Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion, up 7% over the prior year\u2019s quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa process transaction both in the U.S. and internationally. The difference between 7% revenue growth and 11% transaction growth in the period was due to one-time SAMs accrual reversals in the prior year in combination with the influence of the fixed fee component associated with the SAMs pricing structure that does not grow with transactions. International transaction revenue was up 5% to $871 million reflecting some moderation of growth across the globe that first impacted us at the outset of calendar year 2014. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Certain expenses have been rephrased to the Q3 and Q4 fiscal quarters and as signaled last quarter, we continue to expect elevated marketing investments in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q1 tied to the 2014 FIFA World Cup event. Operating margin, 65% for the second quarter, ahead of our annual guidance of low 60s, but consistent with our expectations for higher expenses in the fiscal third and fourth quarters. That said we now expect our full year operating margin to be in the low to mid 60s. Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter. At the end of the March quarter, we had 629 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 634 million. Finally, given our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, let me recap our full year guidance. Constant dollar net revenue growth 10% to 11% with 2 percentage points of negative FX impact; client incentives in the 16.5 to 17.6 range; operating margin in the low to mid 60s; tax rate approaching 30%; EPS growth of mid to high-teens; free cash flow of about 5 billion. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf: Thanks a lot Byron and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with a couple of comments about the quarter and reiterate some of the things that Byron had said. First of all and probably most importantly to us as we look at our results underlying what we see the business drivers from the most part remains steady from last quarter. Specifically the U.S. spending levels grew consistent with that of the prior quarter, not accelerating or decelerating but still reasonably strong and as Byron had mentioned April is off to a strong start which is certainly encouraging for us. Non-U.S. domestic spending grew consistent levels as well and non-U.S. cross-border spending was weaker and as Byron mentioned, it\u2019s from very specific corridors which we can certainly talk more about. Revenue growth came in where we expected and as we mentioned it was impacted by the strong U.S. dollar and these non-recurring comps from the prior year, and we expect these effects to be slightly more pronounced in the third quarter. And looking even beyond the third quarter, we would expect in the fourth quarter to see revenue growth more reflective of the strong payment volumes that continue to underpin our quarterly results. Let me move now for a second and just describe what we see in Russia. As I\u2019m sure you all know the U.S. government imposed economic sanctions a few weeks ago which has forced us to take action. We\u2019re complying with U.S. law as you would expect which means that two affected banks cannot issue or acquire transactions for Visa. These banks represent less than 1% of our volume in Russia and you would expect that we would continue to comply with U.S. law as sanctioned situation evolves. As of now all of the Visa systems are processing normally and we continue to serve all of our other clients in Russia today. Due to U.S. sanctions the Russian Duma is working on modifications to the current national payment system law, President Putin has directed the Duma to pass a series of changes which could pass as early as tomorrow. The proposed modifications are evolving, but as we understand them could include the following; first of all, all domestic data processing would need to be onshore; second, most domestic transactions data would need to remain domiciled within Russia; third, a payment network must provide continuity of services in compliance with Russian law; fourth, the creation of a settlement center 100% owned by the Central Bank of Russia; fifth, a collateral requirement for foreign payment systems; and lastly, the ability to impose volumes on foreign payment system providers. Keep in mind, this is all still fluid and while none of this is certainly helpful for Visa if passed, parts might even cause us to rethink our domestic processing opportunity in Russia. But we are hopeful that there is still opportunity for Visa to participate in the growing in the electronic payments business in Russia. We will not understand the impact on our business in potential future until the laws and regulations are completed. But we remain committed to finding ways to provide our services as long as U.S. government and Russian governments allow. On the legal and regulatory front, not a lot to talk about this quarter as I\u2019m sure you know in late March the U.S. Court have appealed for the DC Court rule but the Federal reserve acted properly in its interpretation of Dodd-Frank a result which we are obviously pleased with. A quick update on payment security and specifically industry collaboration, last quarter I spoke at length about the need for the industry defined broadly to work together to create payment standards and improve security. We believe there is an opportunity for this collaboration to occur and are encouraged. We and MasterCard have formed a cross-industry working group to accelerate this joint-collaboration. The purpose is to work with a broad group of participants in the payments landscape, not just to move forward to more secure technologies in the short-term, but to think in long-term as well. This includes driving EMV adoption, but it looks to create a clear roadmap for the future of payment security, inclusive of both physical, POS as well as card-not-present transactions. The group will have representation of banks of all sizes, credit unions, acquirers, retailers, point of sale manufacturers and industry trade groups. We also look forward to broad network participation so we can be as effective as possible. On EMV specifically First Data Star Network, FIS\u2019s NYCE Network, Discovery Financial Services PULSE Network, and other regional network providers have agreed to participate in the common debit solution that these introduced last year. The collaboration between Visa and our partners will help enable the deployment of debit EMV solutions. This is again an example of industry players working together to move payment security forward. Let me talk for a second about tokenization. The standards, services and technologies we\u2019re working on will play an important role, not just in security but in enabling and securing new payment experiences in the online mobile and face-to-face channels. We are making progress on our work towards getting it into the marketplace. The token standard that we, MasterCard and American Express jointly wrote and sponsored has been adopted by EMVCo, the industry standards body, and is currently at a common period across the other card networks, banks and security industry groups. We will be rolling out our token services capable of associating a limited use of Visa token with an underlying card credential and are working with issuers, processors, and acquirers that introduced our first wave of token programs. You will see applications deployed within the next 12 months and these tokens will play a role in our offerings but also those of select strategic partner engagements ranging from remote online or mobile purchases to proximity mobile interactions. We have also talked a great deal about our merchant efforts. We recently reorganized the Company to strengthen the outreach to our merchant partners. We are lucky to have hired Ram\u00f3n Martin, a well-respected industry expert in payments with a great deal of merchant knowledge. As an example, he has a history as the member of the Board of Directors of the National Retail Federation. We are excited that he will lead our efforts relative to our merchant strategy, and help deliver customized products and services, and look forward to discussing more specifics in the future. Let me now just turn for a second and just talk about small business merchants. We have had made changes to our FANF structure, our fixed acquirer network fee, including modifications that are designed to lower or in some cases eliminate FANF, on volume from small merchants with less than $15,000 in annual gross Visa sales. Most importantly, we believe these changes can serve to expand the Visa acceptance among very small businesses, while eliminating the fees for smaller retailers we\u2019re also making other adjustments to FANF to improve the alignment of these fees, regardless of whether a merchant connects to Visa through an acquirer, a processor, a payment facilitator, or other party. We have also talked on these calls about rules in the past and our efforts to simplify our operating regulations. On October 1st we will be eliminating close to half of our operating rules. This includes reducing the complexity of our dispute resolution processes, and while we are making substantial changes now we continue to get client feedback and we will continue to introduce more changes beyond. Let me talk for a second about Japan. I have spoken about two things here in the past, both the opportunity within Japan but also the importance of growing our processing business globally. Just a reminder, that although Japan is the third largest economy in the world by GDP, the number of payment cards in the market and usage is still very low, only 14% of PCE and just 8% on Visa products. Earlier this month we acquired 100% ownership of GP Net, a joint-venture that we have founded with seven leading Japanese issuers back in 1995, as a result of having total control, we now control our domestic transaction processing activities. It will allow us to further integrate our processing and product solutions to merchants, acquirers and issuers something that we are very excited about. We are also very focused on the debit opportunity in Japan. While debit is still considered in its infancy stage, there is a meaningful opportunity for growth given the large deposit base which exists in the banks from which to grow a debit business. As an example, this quarter we launched Visa Debit with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, one of the three mega banks, again just one example of how we\u2019re working collaboratively with the banks to target a very meaningful opportunity. So to conclude, let me just make a couple of comments looking ahead. First of all I continue to remain very excited about the opportunity that we have to continue growing the business. While the strengthening U.S. dollar and difficult comps from the prior year have affected our reported revenue and will again next quarter, the underlying revenue growth of the business is strong. It will accelerate as the economic recovery accelerates as well, and most importantly the long-term secular trends and our competitive position remain as strong as ever and I\u2019m constantly reminded that there\u2019s more cash to dis-intermediate than when the Company went public in 2008. And with that Byron and I are glad to take your question.\nQuestion:\nand:\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Sir, your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. I guess I just wanted some more context or on some of the comments Byron had about the volumes. Byron you talked about cross-border weakness being temporary and seeing some firmness in the decline. Could you just talk about what gives you comfort that we could rebound from here or at least flatten out? And then second, you guys talked about sustained economic growth and not accelerating growth, is that simply just by observing the absolute volume statistics or there something else you\u2019re seeing underneath the covers that lead you to believe it\u2019s more sustained versus accelerating? Thank you.\n Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Thank you. I guess I just wanted some more context or on some of the comments Byron had about the volumes. Byron you talked about cross-border weakness being temporary and seeing some firmness in the decline. Could you just talk about what gives you comfort that we could rebound from here or at least flatten out? And then second, you guys talked about sustained economic growth and not accelerating growth, is that simply just by observing the absolute volume statistics or there something else you\u2019re seeing underneath the covers that lead you to believe it\u2019s more sustained versus accelerating? Thank you.\nByron Pollitt: So, let me start with cross-border, we haven\u2019t seen single-digit cross-border growth rate since I would say 2009, that was five years ago and given the underlying secular trends in our business none of those are diminished, none of those are going away. As Charlie said, there\u2019s more cash to dis-intermediate today, note, outside the U.S. in particular, then it was when we went public, so from our standpoint, we look at cross-border, the fundamentals are still in place, it recovered nicely from 2009, so we expect to see the same, hard to predict when, and it may be a little early to call, given the April results, but by -- given the 4 percentage point drop we saw between the two quarters and given the fundamentals underpinning this secular shift, our view is we could be reaching a bottoming out, and in any event looking forward we would expect this to move north. In terms of the broader economic question of sustained recovery, this is very much anchored in the volume trends we\u2019re seeing, recognizing that there is modest but if not weak job creation in the U.S., at some point that will begin to accelerate but we are adding jobs, so the underlying fundamentals that should inform and drive spend are in place, they\u2019re just in first gear, and so that\u2019s our take on the environment. Charlie, would you like to add?\nCharlie Scharf: The only thing that I\u2019m going to add, back to the first part of the question on cross-border, as Byron and I both pointed out, the corridors that we\u2019re seeing the weakness are very-very specific places, so for instance when you look at U.S. cardholders traveling abroad, that volume, those growth rates are actually flat quarter-to-quarter, which is obviously a good sign for the core U.S. and the health of the U.S. consumer, again in very-very specific places and not at all across every single geography which would give us more cause for concern.\nJack Carsky: Next question...\nSanjay Sakhrani : Could I ask one more follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind? Embedded in your guidance is what assumption around cross-border growth for the rest of the year?\n Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Could I ask one more follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind? Embedded in your guidance is what assumption around cross-border growth for the rest of the year?\nByron Pollitt: No acceleration.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. Thank you.\n Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.\nTien: Great. Thanks. Just to clarify is the revenue revision at the high-end of the revenue outlook is that really just explained by cross-border or is there something? Just wanted to clarify. And then just maybe on the Russia front, did you disclose how much it represents in terms of revenue, today and I\u2019m curious as a bigger picture question, sorry to build on this but, maybe Charlie, does this Russia situation sort of build this case that maybe countries are going to consider creating their own domestic schemes like the ones that Putin\u2019s talking about? Thanks.\ntsin Huang : Great. Thanks. Just to clarify is the revenue revision at the high-end of the revenue outlook is that really just explained by cross-border or is there something?

Thanks.\nByron Pollitt: I\u2019ll tell you what Tien-tsin, could you re-ask your first question, I didn\u2019t actually understand it.\nTien: Yes, I\u2019m rambling a little bit Byron, just the first question in a simple way, is the revenue revision in terms of your outlook, I think you said it was 10 to 13 before, and now we\u2019re looking at 10 to 11, if I heard that correctly. It\u2019s the difference there just across the border or is there something else?\ntsin Huang : Yes, I\u2019m rambling a little bit Byron, just the first question in a simple way, is the revenue revision in terms of your outlook, I think you said it was 10 to 13 before, and now we\u2019re looking at 10 to 11, if I heard that correctly. It\u2019s the difference there just across the border or is there something else?\n JPMorgan Chase : Yes, I\u2019m rambling a little bit Byron, just the first question in a simple way, is the revenue revision in terms of your outlook, I think you said it was 10 to 13 before, and now we\u2019re looking at 10 to 11, if I heard that correctly. It\u2019s the difference there just across the border or is there something else?\nByron Pollitt: Yes we would -- it\u2019s heavily driven by cross-border. We would also add that U.S. debit down shifted more than we had anticipated when we constructed the original range. And so those are the -- I would say those are the two primary.\nTien: Understood. And then on the Russian stuff?\ntsin Huang : Understood. And then on the Russian stuff?\n JPMorgan Chase: Understood. And then on the Russian stuff?\nByron Pollitt: On the Russia, let me answer the first part of the question, which is the revenue part and then I\u2019ll turn it back over to Charlie for the second part. When we said that there were several pennies of impact, you may attribute 100% of that to revenue, and we didn\u2019t put any expense offset against that, so it would be the revenue equivalent in this fiscal year, and heavily weighted, 90% weighted to fiscal Q\u2019s 3 and 4.\nCharlie Scharf: And the only thing I would just, on that point, and then going to your last point Tien-tsin is, remember, we don\u2019t know exactly, what our position will be in the marketplace. So the issues that exist really today relate to domestic processing within Russia. We still think by the way that there is meaningful reasons why the Russian government should want ourselves and the other established networks to participate there. And so we\u2019re not assuming that it\u2019s in the best interest of them for us not want to be there. And away from the domestic business there\u2019s obviously a very big part of our opportunity there is cross-border, which as you know is extremely hard to build a cross-border brand and processing assets in a short period of time. So again we really are still trying to understand ourselves exactly how this could play itself out. But still are hopeful that we still have a meaningful opportunity to continue to participate in the growing electronic payments business in Russia. And then we are broadly, kind of your last part of question on national payment systems, certainly the activities within Russia get people thinking about what it means for them. I\u2019m not sure how many parts of the world are actually contemplating the types of activities that Russia has taken upon themselves to bring about the sanctions which certainly should factor into people\u2019s minds. But as you know there are national payment schemes in different parts of the world that we compete with. And you know we firmly believe that what we have to offer goes well beyond what a national payment scheme can offer in terms of the capabilities of our network, our global acceptance, our ability to be accepted across all channels, fraud screening, I mean we can go on and on with the list. And so we are used to competing, and as long as there is the opportunity to compete, then we feel okay about the prospects. But certainly it\u2019s an issue.\nTien: Excellent, thank you.\ntsin Huang : Excellent, thank you.\n JPMorgan Chase: Excellent, thank you.\nJack Carsky:  Next question. \nOperator: Our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane : Yes hi guys just a couple of questions. One, just the down shift in U.S. debit and then obviously the lower cross-border volume, is any of that impacted by a share shift or share loss, or do you think that\u2019s all economically driven? And then secondly just a clarification on Russia, is the a couple of pennies, that you\u2019re talking about in earnings hit, is that 100% of Russia going away, or is that just the piece you think is going away due to the written proposal of the legislation that Charlie highlighted? Thanks.\n Deutsche Bank: Yes hi guys just a couple of questions. One, just the down shift in U.S. debit and then obviously the lower cross-border volume, is any of that impacted by a share shift or share loss, or do you think that\u2019s all economically driven? And then secondly just a clarification on Russia, is the a couple of pennies, that you\u2019re talking about in earnings hit, is that 100% of Russia going away, or is that just the piece you think is going away due to the written proposal of the legislation that Charlie highlighted? Thanks.\nByron Pollitt: On U.S. debit, it is, and we expect it to continue to be a pretty competitive space without full access to all the other debit spend just yet hard to know whether there is any shift going on. But we think that there has been a down shift in debit spend. We saw some of it occur right after the target breach, and so this is one where -- we\u2019ll just have to see it play out where we are encouraged by the spike post to Easter. So I think we will stay with this question over the next couple of quarters and get better informed. Cross-border, we don\u2019t think so, in terms of share shift. When you revert back to very specific corridors, very specific countries that have regulatory and tax events namely in Brazil and Argentina, manipulation of exchange rates by the Venezuelan government, those things are going to impact everybody. And so we don\u2019t think there is a sense of share shift there. This is just something much more fundamental to cross-border travel, and it should impact all. With regards to Russia a portion of the down shift in revenue growth is very clearly cross-border. In the quarter leading up to the Crimea crisis we began to see a down shift in Russian travel. But it was a modest deceleration. It then dropped quite a bit further after the Crimea crisis unfolded. This is a level of travel that this country generates a level of cross-border travel that if things quote return back to normal whatever that is in the future, we could easily see a rebound in Russia, Russian cross-border. We have got some place holders in for sanction effects that could be ongoing but honestly as Charlie said it\u2019s way too early to call this the situation is very much fluid at the moment and we\u2019ll keep you updated as we progress. Charlie do you want to add?\nCharlie Scharf: No I think that\u2019s fine.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nGlenn Fodor : Hi. Thanks for taking my question I appreciate all the color on a confusing situation like Russia, but Charlie turning to a issuer that you know very well during the quarter Chase gave a little more color on what they\u2019re doing with ChaseNET so now given the largest wallet initiative out there among the large issuers so just thinking about it this initiative takes hold in other and successful for them and other large issuers start considering the same strategy what you think it means for your efforts with V.me and I\u2019m sure this issue comes in your discussions with large issuers. Can you shed some light on how they reconcile the thoughts between their own initiatives on wallets and V.me? Thanks.\n Autonomous Research: Hi. Thanks for taking my question I appreciate all the color on a confusing situation like Russia, but Charlie turning to a issuer that you know very well during the quarter Chase gave a little more color on what they\u2019re doing with ChaseNET so now given the largest wallet initiative out there among the large issuers so just thinking about it this initiative takes hold in other and successful for them and other large issuers start considering the same strategy what you think it means for your efforts with V.me and I\u2019m sure this issue comes in your discussions with large issuers. Can you shed some light on how they reconcile the thoughts between their own initiatives on wallets and V.me? Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf: Sure. Listen I can\u2019t speak for every issuer or certainly I cannot speak for Chase as well what I can tell you from our point of view is we are fairly agnostic as to whether it\u2019s our wallet or someone else\u2019s wallet as long as our cards are appropriately represented on a fair level playing field. And in the case of Chase whether it\u2019s our cards or whether it runs over VisaNet or their version of VisaNet again we view those as our transactions. So to the extent that other issuers choose to want to go build their own wallets we\u2019ll be supportive of that but that doesn\u2019t stop us from continuing to build our wallet capabilities which I don\u2019t like to use the word wallet I like to use the word digital acceptance as a way to think about what we\u2019re trying to build. So that every bank out there and to serve its customers properly in digital commerce with digital acceptance. So hope that answers your question.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin : Thanks. So just quickly I thought I heard you say Charlie that there you\u2019re dropping as of October 1st you\u2019re eliminating say 50% of your operating rules is that?\n RBC Capital Markets: Thanks. So just quickly I thought I heard you say Charlie that there you\u2019re dropping as of October 1st you\u2019re eliminating say 50% of your operating rules is that?\nCharlie Scharf: That\u2019s correct.\nDan Perlin : Okay. And so what I was trying to get at I guess in that question is what is it that I guess you\u2019re hoping to achieve by simplifying that I know it\u2019s a big part of your strategy that you\u2019ve highlighted in the past but I\u2019m wondering is that hope that it\u2019s going to come with incremental volumes and the retailers are looking to this and you\u2019ve also adjusted the stamp fee for small merchants so I\u2019m just trying to understand from a bigger perspective what is it that you\u2019re hoping to gain by changing half of your operating rules that\u2019s a pretty significant change?\n RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And so what I was trying to get at I guess in that question is what is it that I guess you\u2019re hoping to achieve by simplifying that I know it\u2019s a big part of your strategy that you\u2019ve highlighted in the past but I\u2019m wondering is that hope that it\u2019s going to come with incremental volumes and the retailers are looking to this and you\u2019ve also adjusted the stamp fee for small merchants so I\u2019m just trying to understand from a bigger perspective what is it that you\u2019re hoping to gain by changing half of your operating rules that\u2019s a pretty significant change?\nCharlie Scharf: Shortlist and I think all of these things that you pointed out in addition to the operating regs go towards the point of I think most people would tell you whether you\u2019re an issue or merchant or in an acquirer people would say that historically that we were probably pretty difficult to deal with and we operate in a very competitive world today people have choices both established choices and have the opportunity to think of other ways to process payments and we want people to enjoy doing business with us and to think that we treat them openly, fairly and clearly and our operating regs which I\u2019ve got the version and they\u2019re sitting on my desk it\u2019s actually 1,538 pages pre our changes. Okay. And so imagine trying to be -- you are an issuer or an acquirer and you\u2019ve got to live by those and so simplification redundancy helping people understand what it means to do business with us as well as going out and what we\u2019ve been doing is asking again issuers, acquires, merchants what don\u2019t you like in that, what doesn\u2019t makes sense and a big part of the feedback that we received was on charge backs and the processes that we have put in place, the reporting requirements documentation and things like that. So we\u2019re very committed to continuing to support the integrity of our brand, the integrity of the payment system security and things that go towards the quality of our network but we have to be the kind of place that people say I understand the rules, I understand what it means to do business with you and you don\u2019t have a bunch of things buried on page 1,427 that they didn\u2019t understand. That in combination with these other things again I think just as if I was on the other side trying to figure out who I would want to do business with is the way I\u2019s wanted to be treated and that\u2019s way we\u2019re approaching it.\nDan Perlin : Got it, thank you.\n RBC Capital Markets: Got it, thank you.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from James Friedman of SIG. Your line is open.\nJames Friedman : Hi. I wanted to ask you about NACHA and the prospects for acceleration in ACH, either Charlie or Byron, if you could help us think about the competitive dynamics in the instance that ACH were to be accelerated how if at all might it impact your business?\n Susquehanna Financial Group: Hi. I wanted to ask you about NACHA and the prospects for acceleration in ACH, either Charlie or Byron, if you could help us think about the competitive dynamics in the instance that ACH were to be accelerated how if at all might it impact your business?\nSIG: Hi. I wanted to ask you about NACHA and the prospects for acceleration in ACH, either Charlie or Byron, if you could help us think about the competitive dynamics in the instance that ACH were to be accelerated how if at all might it impact your business?\nCharlie Scharf: Sure I guess I can start with this, which is we, our -- the differences between what the established payment networks have and what ACH\u2019s the differences are huge. It\u2019s not just the frequency of settlement it\u2019s the underlying ease of use of the ability to integrate within your systems it\u2019s the data that we have collected and then enable both issuers, acquirers and merchants to use it in the way which is good for risk purposes scorings that we\u2019ve developed and we have a whole series of capabilities that again that we\u2019ve all developed over 10, 20, 30, 40 years that really is not easily replicable. Our view is that certainly the issuers understand the benefits of working with that in this ecosystem they control the customer relationships and so we\u2019re very confident in that position that we have and the ability to differentiate our services versus what ACH can do. And I think if you look at some of the big players that use ACH and actually track through ACH and see well how does that actually impact the customer experience? It\u2019s a terrible experience for the customer as opposed to a network like ours. And in the environment that we live in today and the way banks are viewing the importance of their customer relationships it\u2019s just another differentiator that we had. So we love the position that we have relative to ACH.\nJames Friedman : Thank you.\n Susquehanna Financial Group: Thank you.\nSIG: Thank you.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nDon Fandetti : Yes Byron just given the slowdown in cross-border I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your relative revenue yield my understanding is in the U.S. the yield is pretty high compared to domestic I mean is there a difference between let\u2019s say [indiscernible] and Asia can you talk a little bit about that?\n Citigroup: Yes Byron just given the slowdown in cross-border I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your relative revenue yield my understanding is in the U.S. the yield is pretty high compared to domestic I mean is there a difference between let\u2019s say [indiscernible] and Asia can you talk a little bit about that?\nByron Pollitt: There are differences and there are different practices with regards to yields across the globe. We typically don\u2019t get into that level of detail to be a little helpful in this arena to the extent that there is a strong growth by U.S. cardholders that it\u2019s a strong consistent yield from an area of the world that is particularly well positioned to grow cross-border because of the strength of the U.S. dollar. You\u2019ll note that when we referenced the cross-border weakness before we called out a specific corridor it was Canada to the U.S. the U.S. to Canada corridor is doing just fine and as Charlie said the outbound travel by U.S. cardholders has remained quite strong and so I will leave the color at that.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.\nDavid Hochstim : Yes. Thanks. I was wondering could you just give us an update on what\u2019s happening with CyberSource there is a little bit of a deceleration in volume growth in V.me filings too?\n Buckingham Research: Yes. Thanks. I was wondering could you just give us an update on what\u2019s happening with CyberSource there is a little bit of a deceleration in volume growth in V.me filings too?\nByron Pollitt: Okay, I\u2019ll take the CyberSource, so there has been some deceleration in the growth of CyberSource we contribute that specifically to two large customers or clients that we lost in fiscal year \u201913 and we\u2019re starting to see the impacts of that in \u201914 that said we are very bullish on CyberSource we recognize the issue, we are investing significant sums to upgrade and add to the features of our CyberSource platform both for large enterprise businesses as well as for small businesses, we are actively adding people to this business. So our enthusiasm remains robust I will caution that it will take several quarters before we can get this turned around but remain very bullish and very confident on the outlook of CyberSource\u2019s future with Visa.\nCharlie Scharf: And let me take V.me. So I think I\u2019ve talked to on the prior year\u2019s call we have learned an awful lot since our initial rollout of V.me and we have altered our approach to really take away all the functionality other than what I described before as meaningful digital acceptance. And so we\u2019re getting really excellent feedback from merchants and issuers alike. We\u2019ve actually rolled out the first phase of the new platform a few months ago and we have begun launching it with those merchants. It\u2019s incredibly -- it's just hugely more simple for them to actually integrate it into their checkout experience literally days as opposed to months and the new integrations that we have include Lululemon, Autozone, Petco and the Wine Enthusiast. But probably more exciting those are terrific names but we\u2019ve also executed term sheets or master service agreements with an additional 38 large merchants which represent almost 60 billion in addressable volume. 23 of those merchants are actually in the Internet Retailer Top 100. So we\u2019re going to -- we're continuing a press forward, we have a much better solution in the market, and it\u2019s resonating.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.\nCraig Maurer : Yes hi thanks. A couple of things, regarding just I want to clarify, so you\u2019re EPS guidance fully contemplates the tax benefit you received in the quarter. Please clarify that. And secondly, regarding Russia, should we see the changes to law that you discussed earlier, specifically related to the basically trapping data and transaction flow and what not we\u2019ve seen in Russia. Is your current network structure capable of doing that, as of tomorrow. Because if I remember correctly, you guys were in a hub and spoke network where your data flows back through the states?\n CLSA: Yes hi thanks. A couple of things, regarding just I want to clarify, so you\u2019re EPS guidance fully contemplates the tax benefit you received in the quarter. Please clarify that. And secondly, regarding Russia, should we see the changes to law that you discussed earlier, specifically related to the basically trapping data and transaction flow and what not we\u2019ve seen in Russia. Is your current network structure capable of doing that, as of tomorrow. Because if I remember correctly, you guys were in a hub and spoke network where your data flows back through the states?\nByron Pollitt: Let me take the tax and EPS question first. The direct answer to your question is yes. The tax benefit that we recorded this quarter was contemplated in our full year guidance. That said, let me just provide updated perspective. When we give guidance as we did at the beginning of the fiscal year, so this was back in October, our style is to offer guidance without caveat and without excuse. And so when we give guidance it is naturally broader and have to take into a number of unknowns and you make educated judgments on how the year would unfold. The rate of economic recovery, unknown, cross-border impacts given a stronger U.S. dollar and currency movements, unknown, cross-border impacts due to global tensions, unknown. Thing about taxes is that as you get into the range where we are currently operating on taxes, this becomes more initiative driven as opposed to where your operating throughout the country, throughout the world. And so as these initiatives, as this one often take several years to research, prepare, occur, recording, and so the timing of these is often outside of our immediate control and therefore unknown with regards to when we can actually take them. And so all of these things are contemplated. We did contemplate including tax. We also began the year with a range of revenue that was low double-digits constant dollar which was 10% to 13%. Had we delivered in 12% to 13% constant dollar as opposed to what we are now seeing given other impacts in other areas of 10 to 11, then we would have been at the upper-end, certainly at the upper-end of our guidance if not a little above because more than one factor is playing out in our favor to a greater degree than we might have contemplated in the beginning. So that\u2019s the context. Charlie, Russia?\nCharlie Scharf: So let me.\nByron Pollitt: So it\u2019s like, it\u2019s on to the Russian expert here.\nCharlie Scharf: So on the question, and I just want to reiterate to be clear that the law is still evolving. As it gets red, it does evolve and get -- and there are changes that occur from day-to-day, and then once the law is actually passed there do have to be regulations to coincide with those laws before they get implemented. So there are some things in the law which there would be relatively quick implementation. There are other things which I think some of the dates go out until 2016. To answer your specific question, today, we do not have the ability, in a very quick way to deploy a separate version of VisaNet in a specific country. Having said that, we do have instances where we can start to move parts of it, whether authorization is much easier for us to do than entire clearing and settlement, and there it\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re capable of building even though it might take a little bit of time. But also remember, I mean this is critical, because you\u2019ve got very much, we\u2019re caught between the politics of the United States and the politics of Russia. But you just get down to reality for a second. We have 100 million cards in Russia today. We have 100 million cards there and if not in anyone\u2019s best interest inclusive of the Russians to make those cards not available to their own citizens. And so that\u2019s why we are hopeful that as this situation unfolds, that people understand things like that and that to the extent that they believe it\u2019s important to build a national payment system. It can be done in a way where there is the appropriate transition and we have the ability to figure out whether it makes sense to compete in that marketplace, because there would be unlikely that, unless there\u2019s some draconian things that are passed that it wouldn\u2019t evolve in a way like that.\nCraig Maurer : Just on that point, because I think this is important looking out concerning the NSA concerns and what not, if they did go ahead and make those changes have you contemplated the length of time it would take to restructure your network to comply because this could apply in the future to how China opens up. And we know that your biggest competitor is already there with the technology in place so if it was a short window, given a conversion could theoretically be done away from you.\n CLSA: Just on that point, because I think this is important looking out concerning the NSA concerns and what not, if they did go ahead and make those changes have you contemplated the length of time it would take to restructure your network to comply because this could apply in the future to how China opens up. And we know that your biggest competitor is already there with the technology in place so if it was a short window, given a conversion could theoretically be done away from you.\nCharlie Scharf: Okay, so two different things, number one is absolutely we\u2019ve done an awful lot of work and you can assume that we\u2019re preparing for everything that we should prepare to, the second is, I would just caution you to make the statements that others can comply.\nCraig Maurer : Okay, thank you.\n CLSA: Okay, thank you.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut : Thank you very much, can you give us an update on the size of the commercial card as a percentage of total volumes and give us also a sense of the growth rate and whether that\u2019s been affected at all by the issues you put forward today?\n Evercore: Thank you very much, can you give us an update on the size of the commercial card as a percentage of total volumes and give us also a sense of the growth rate and whether that\u2019s been affected at all by the issues you put forward today?\nByron Pollitt: On the first part of your question, no, not, but Investor Relations could give you an update on that afterwards, let me just quickly look, commercial payment volume growth, we can give you a perspective from the U.S., and since the beginning of the calendar year it has been low double-digit growth, very high single to low double-digit growth consistently January, February, March, with an uptick in April.\nDavid Togut : Thank you.\n Evercore: Thank you.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller : Thanks. I just want to shift gears to margins for a minute, the personal expense came in below our estimates and you also raised your outlook for margins to the mid 60s versus low 60s previously. First, is there anything new that\u2019s driving the change versus your initial expectation and can we expect that to really continue off of a new base being mid 60s now into future years, and then just a quick housekeeping Byron, I know that you -- you should metrics into April 21, most of them looked like they were expanding or accelerating, just what impact did Easter actually have, given the timing in April this year versus last year, I don\u2019t know if you said that on the call before? Thanks.\n Barclays Capital: Thanks. I just want to shift gears to margins for a minute, the personal expense came in below our estimates and you also raised your outlook for margins to the mid 60s versus low 60s previously. First, is there anything new that\u2019s driving the change versus your initial expectation and can we expect that to really continue off of a new base being mid 60s now into future years, and then just a quick housekeeping Byron, I know that you -- you should metrics into April 21, most of them looked like they were expanding or accelerating, just what impact did Easter actually have, given the timing in April this year versus last year, I don\u2019t know if you said that on the call before? Thanks.\nByron Pollitt: We didn\u2019t, what I said on the call beginning with the April results is that it\u2019s very clear, I\u2019ve been in a form of retail for 18 years before coming to Visa, the Easter impact is absolutely a phenomenon that exists, typically you look at the run rate going in, the run rate going out, you compare it to the prior year. we\u2019re several weeks away from being able to do that metric but the lift, part of the lift is certainly due to Easter, it\u2019s also sensible that part of the lift could well be a return to be more normal weather, it\u2019s very hard to isolate specific weather impacts but we have done a lot of work around those states in the U.S. for example that had much more severe weather than normal versus those that didn\u2019t, the growth rates, there\u2019s a clear delta in the growth rates, some of it but not all of it mitigated by e-commerce, so as we get back to more normal periods post Easter, post weather, I think we\u2019ll see a more normalized growth rate and one that may very well have some pent up demand fueling it. With regards to expenses, the, at some point predictably as we continue to invest aggressively in extending our network, the reach of our network like a CyberSource, those, that investment will come with margins that are not that attractive or we wouldn\u2019t invest but they\u2019re not going to be in the 60s, we\u2019ve not reached that inflection point yet, and so that\u2019s why you saw us on the margin move up from low 60s to low to mid 60s, and with regards to personnel if you think about it, when we went public in 2008, we had 4,000 plus employees, today we have 10,000. And so in the span of a little over five years we have more than doubled our employee base and we go in searches, we digest, we optimize, we go forward, we will continue to invest in talent which is a key driver of our success and we would expect growth of the personnel base that you see today despite the more than doubling of our personnel over the past five years.\nJack Carsky: Adrian, at this point we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay our final question is from Jennifer Dugan of Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.\nJennifer Dugan : Thank you, most of my questions have been answered but I was wondering could you give us a little bit more color on the expected fiscal 2015 revenue impact from the Chase conversion that\u2019s going to happen towards the end of the year?\n Sterne, Agee: Thank you, most of my questions have been answered but I was wondering could you give us a little bit more color on the expected fiscal 2015 revenue impact from the Chase conversion that\u2019s going to happen towards the end of the year?\nByron Pollitt: At this point we would, we do expect to have an impact, it should not be, it\u2019s a valued and important addition to our business, I think to the extent that we wouldn\u2019t give color on that specifically but we do expect it to start showing up in the first fiscal quarter and I\u2019ll remind the group, some of the conversions are taking place today and will pick up pace or expected to pick up pace as the year unfolds, but to the extent that that revenue shows up in service fees, we book our service fees on a one quarter lag, so any conversions that take place say in the fourth fiscal quarter, the service fees won\u2019t show up until the first fiscal quarter of fiscal \u201915.\nJack Carsky: And with that we\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us today, if anybody has follow-up questions feel free to call Investor Relations. Have a nice evening.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference and you may disconnect at this time."}, {"symbol": "V", "quarter": 1, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-01-30 11:12:04", "content": "Executives: Jack Carsky - Head, Global Investor Relations Byron Pollitt - Chief Financial Officer Charlie Scharf - Chief Executive Officer \nAnalysts: Tim Willi - Wells Fargo Bob Napoli - William Blair Tom McCrohan - Janney Capital Markets Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Darrin Peller - Barclays Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW Craig Maurer - CLSA Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey\nOperator: Welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal Q1 2014 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, head of global investor relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.\nJack Carsky : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s chief executive officer, and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s chief financial officer. This call is currently being webcast over the internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our website prior to this call. Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as a result of variety of factors. Additional information concerning these factors is available in our most reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the investor relations section of Visa\u2019s website. For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC are available in the Financial and Statistical Summary accompanying today\u2019s press release. This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.\nByron Pollitt: Thank you, Jack. We will begin my call with the usual callouts and observations. First, let me start with payment volume and cross-border trends. The December quarter, on a constant dollar basis, grew payment volume at 11%, down 2 percentage points from the September quarter. This softening was led by a 2 percentage point drop in the U.S. from 10% to 8%, with the holiday spend consistent with a continuing U.S. economic recovery, but at a growth rate we would describe as tepid. U.S. results for the first 21 days of January were consistent with the December quarter. International payment volume growth rates in the December quarter remained healthy, in the mid-teens. On the cross-border front, growth picked up 1 percentage point from the September quarter, with both U.S. and international on the uptick. That said, January appears to be giving back some of the heightened cross-border activity we saw in the month of December. Second callout: let me begin by saying that we are affirming all our guidance metrics outlined on our October call. With that as perspective, I would like to elaborate on our net revenue growth guidance.  Our guidance calls for low double-digits on a constant dollar basis offset by about 2 percentage points of negative FX. We define low double-digits as 10% to 13%. This means on an as-reported or nominal basis, growth is expected to be in the 8% to 11% range after FX impacts.  On the FX front, after adjusting for hedges, we expect about 2 percentage points of negative impact in all four fiscal quarters. Given Visa\u2019s relevant basket of currencies, the forward rates indicate continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar through the balance of the fiscal year. Drilling down a bit further, a stronger U.S. dollar versus the currencies for Japan, Brazil, Australia, and Canada, and more recently Argentina and Venezuela, have driven our headwind. In contrast, while the euro has strengthened versus the U.S. dollar, the absence of Europe from Visa, Inc.\u2019s geographic portfolio has muted this potential benefit. Staying with revenue but switching gears, the quarterly growth rates for the balance of the year are expected to vary, with softer growth rates in Q2 and Q3, followed by an uptick in Q4. This cadence is driven by the following: the lapping of particularly strong revenue growth rates in Q2 and Q3 of the prior year, which benefited from low levels of client incentives and certain nonrecurring pricing actions, all of which were called out in last year\u2019s earnings calls. In contrast, Q4 of last year had a disproportionate share of the fiscal year\u2019s client incentives, which is a pattern that, at this point in the year, we do not expect to repeat.  The third callout relates to the quarterly cadence for marketing spend. With the Winter Olympics rapidly approaching and World Cup soon to follow, we expect a significant uptick in marketing spend in Q2 and Q3 versus our spend in Q1, followed by a downshift in Q4. This, of course, will have an impact on quarterly operating margins.  Fourth callout is the return of litigation escrow funds from those merchants opting out of the recently approved class action settlement, the dynamics of which we covered at our investor day in June and reiterated last quarter. On January 27, $1.1 billion was returned to us and was deposited back into our litigation escrow account. The receipt of the payment increases our current taxable income by $1.1 billion and income tax payables by $387 million. While it has no direct effect on our income statement, it negatively impacts our free cash flow over the last three quarters of fiscal 2014. This event was fully contemplated and is reflected in our full year guidance of about $5 billion in free cash flow. To be clear, the return of the actual escrow funds is not included in our free cash flow, but the impact of higher cash taxes is included. Last callout: as always, we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of 5.5 million shares during the quarter, at an average price per share of $199 and change. This leaves an outstanding open to buy of 4.2 billion. Now let\u2019s turn to the numbers. I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the fiscal first quarter, followed by our results through January 21. I\u2019ll then cover the financial highlights of our first fiscal quarter. Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%, modestly below the September quarter\u2019s 13%. The U.S. grew 8%, and international grew 15%. More recently, in the U.S., through January 21, payment volume continued at 8%. Drilling down further, U.S. credit was 10% in both Q1 and through January 21, compared to 11% in Q4. Similarly, U.S. debit grew at 7% in both Q1 and through January 21, compared to 10% in Q4. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 12% constant dollar growth rate in the December quarter, up modestly from the 11% rate in the September quarter. The U.S. grew 11% and international 13% in constant dollars. Through January 21, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 10% with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and international 11%. Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled $16 billion in the first fiscal quarter, a 13% increase over the prior year period. The U.S. grew 9% while international delivered 26% growth. Through January 21, processed transaction growth was 11%.  Now turning to the income statement, net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, an 11% increase year over year driven primarily by solid growth globally in both domestic and international transactions and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by a 2% FX headwind. Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.4 billion, up 9% over the past year, and was driven by solid global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue, $1.3 billion, up 13% over the prior year quarter, based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions, both in the U.S. and internationally. International transaction revenue was up 11% to $891 million, reflecting an ongoing broad-based strength in cross-border volume. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 3% from the prior year. Given earlier discussion on the cadence of marketing spend, we expect expense growth in Q2 and Q3 to be somewhat higher versus Q1. Operating margin was 66% for the first quarter, ahead of our yearly guidance of low 60s, but consistent with our expectations. We expect Q1 to be our lowest quarter for operating expense in fiscal 2014. Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 32.4%. Capital expenditures were $120 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 634 million shares of class A common stock outstanding on an as-converted basis, and the weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 639 million. Finally, as noted earlier, our full year guidance metrics for revenue growth, client incentives, operating margin, EPS growth, and free cash flow remain unchanged. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf: Thank you very much, Byron, and good morning to everyone. First, let me just start by saying that we feel very good about the strong financial performance during the quarter, as Byron had mentioned: solid revenue growth, solid net income growth, and solid earnings per share growth.  Global payment volume, as you can see from the numbers, is relatively strong. Holiday spend in the U.S. was better than reported as we were going through the holiday season, and was certainly impacted by the shorter calendar. It was extremely uneven as we were going through it, and the continued movement from face-to-face to digital purchases was extremely meaningful. Let me just give you some updates on the legal and regulatory front. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read, on December 13, U.S. District Judge Gleeson granted final approval of the merchant litigation cases. As part of the settlement, Visa and the other defendants received a comprehensive release of liability to claims in the lawsuit, as well as protection against further litigation regarding interchange and other U.S. rules. As expected, a number of objectors to the settlement have appealed.  We at Visa are very focused on concluding these disagreements and on building our efforts to enter into a better relationship with the entire merchant community, identifying new ways to enable them to differentiate themselves and their customer experiences, and competing more effectively.  Also, about two weeks ago, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC circuit heard oral arguments and the Fed\u2019s appeal of Judge Leon\u2019s decision in the challenge to the Durbin regulations. While it\u2019s hard to make any courtroom predictions, as we all know, we\u2019re pleased with the hearing. We continue to believe that the government has a strong case on appeal. Let me move on and just talk for a second about some topics of interest and start with the recent industry data breaches. First of all, we understand that these events are terrible for everyone affected. Everyone is the merchant, the issuer, the acquirer, the networks, but most importantly the consumer. And while the consumers are generally protected by the network rules of zero liability, meaning they\u2019re not responsible for any fraud due to the breach, we all have to realize that these compromises are disturbing to them, they\u2019re inconvenient, and they raise broader data security concerns that the entire industry must solve.  Unfortunately, many merchants, issuers, and both of their lobbyists are attempting to assign blame in the press and not reacting in a particularly constructive manner, and it\u2019s in all of our best interests that this change quickly. Within the payments ecosystem, the impact on the merchants, the acquirer, the issuer, and the network are all equally negative.  We all share the same customer, who\u2019s going through this difficult experience, and our sales and long term relationships with that customer will suffer if we don\u2019t work together to get to a better place. The appropriate way to respond to this issue for all parties to jointly work together toward better data security standards and better payment security standards. Maintaining trust in the electronic payment systems is our highest priority, and we\u2019re actively exploring new ways to enhance the safety and security of the payment system.  To that end, we do believe it\u2019s critical that we make progress toward the implementation of EMV Chip in the U.S. We can\u2019t do this on our own. We need merchants, acquirers, and issuers to be supportive. We know it\u2019s expensive. It means new cards, new terminals, new software development, but as we can all see, it is necessary.  It\u2019s our hope that all issuers and merchants will migrate to EMV, but we also understand that it\u2019s complex. There are an awful lot of terminals out there and an awful lot of cards that have to be updated, and this has to be done in a way that does not disturb commerce. In 2011, we had announced a plan to migrate the U.S. to EMV technology through a liability shift beginning in October 2015 and we have reaffirmed these dates. EMV, to be clear, would potentially eliminate the ability to reproduce the card and thereby reduce if not eliminate counterfeit fraud at the point of sale, but it\u2019s also important to note that it\u2019s equally imperative that the industry move towards tokenization, which should be equally effective at reducing or eliminating card not present fraud. As we work towards a better solution, we\u2019re also redoubling our efforts to make sure that consumers understand that they\u2019re protected. We\u2019ve invested in national advertising to reassure customers of the zero liability fraud protection. These important protections shield our consumers in the U.S. from bearing any fraud loss after data compromise, as I said before. We\u2019re also focused on making sure that there\u2019s clarity of fact with the media and in Washington. I\u2019m personally concerned about the amount of misinformation you read in the public domain, from confusion around who incurs the cost of fraud losses, to the misrepresented lack of payment system security.  This is misleading, inaccurate, and not helpful, and can have unintended public policy consequences. We\u2019re actively engaged with policymakers in Washington, DC, along with our partners, to ensure that they actually hear the facts and understand the multiple layers of infrastructure that protect the payment system.  Let me just switch topics for a second and just talk for a second about V.me, which we\u2019ve done on several calls. On the last quarterly call, I spoke about our efforts to simplify what we\u2019re building. Since launching it, we\u2019ve learned valuable lessons, as we\u2019ve talked about, to accelerate its success in the marketplace and better meet the needs of what our issuers and merchants actually want in the marketplace.  We\u2019ve been working hard to evolve the product in response to what we\u2019ve heard from them, which is to simplify the merchant integration and focus on the simplicity of consumer card payments for online and mobile transactions. We\u2019re pleased that the work is now coming to market, with the first phase of our redesigned platform released last week, providing merchants with faster integration and easier time to market.  I can share now that Jos A. Bank, Ticketmaster, Auto Zone, and Petco will be some of the first merchants to go live withV.me through this new, simplified integration. These new merchants join the strong group of existing merchants and financial institutions already offering V.me to their consumers, which represent over $13 billion in spend and approximately $300 million in addressable cards. And we\u2019ve talked about that our success here at Visa does depend on the strength of our relationships with all parties in the payment system. We value all of those relationships, and we continue to work hard to solidify those relationships.  As we\u2019ve talked about, we reorganized the company last year to strengthen our outreach to all of those constituents. To that end, we have made good progress and our track record of winning or renewing issuer and cobrand contracts is excellent.  Let me just talk for a second about our cobrand business, because we\u2019ve gotten a series of questions from that as we\u2019ve met with you all. Let me just talk about, because the U.S. is far and away the majority of where the cobrand market is, and just talk about some of the effects for us in our fiscal 2013 year, looking backwards.  Just remember, we have the leading cobrand market share. Most cobrands do not go to RFP, and when we look on a volume-weighted basis at our renewals, we renewed about 95% of our current cobrand deals that were actually up for renewal. We also won about 60% of the new cobrand deals on a volume-weighted basis. As we said at investor day, seven of the top U.S. cobrands are a majority of Visa. So when you look at those numbers, we\u2019re very pleased with the business that we\u2019ve had and the rate of success we continue to have in the marketplace, and our cobrand pipeline is very healthy in fiscal 2014 and beyond, as we look ahead. Let me just change gears for a second and just share with you some facts about our new platform: Everywhere You Want to Be, which is a new integrated campaign that communicates our vision and how our brand is positioned for the future. Those of you who have been covering us for a while may remember we once used the tagline Visa, it\u2019s Everywhere You Want to Be, to reflect the growing presence of Visa in merchant locations across the United States.  Today, the new global campaign allows us to expand what \u201ceverywhere\u201d means and build upon the historical equities of the brand. We\u2019re bringing this new Visa brand and our mark to light gradually, starting with Olympic-themed advertising in the U.S. and a rollout to more markets and audiences around the world, starting in March. So I\u2019m going to conclude just by reaffirming our view here of how excited we are about the future and the opportunity. We\u2019ve talked about the secular opportunity to penetrate cash and check and how healthy that opportunity is across the entire globe. We continue to work on innovation, being flexible and adaptive in the world we live in, both for our existing customers and continuing to open up the network on the edges to embrace the change that\u2019s going on around us. And with that, I\u2019m going to open up the floor for questions to Byron and myself. \nOperator: [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Tim Willi from Wells Fargo. \nTim Willi - Wells Fargo: Wanted to get your thoughts, if you could, around Bitcoin. Obviously, that\u2019s sort of the new rage. We get a lot of questions from investors. I\u2019m sure you do as well. But can you just talk about how you think about it, whether it is something that potentially could be a broad consumer application, or if it\u2019s more of a niche around cross-border business? Or just how how you might think about that, and how Visa might interact or support that, or not at all.\nCharlie Scharf : I guess I would start with, it\u2019s early days in terms of what Bitcoin is, and what it will be. We\u2019re certainly paying attention to it. It\u2019s very early to understand exactly what all of the implications are for it.  We will say, when we look at our network and the people that we compete with in terms of what people think of as a traditional network, the established network rules we have, the understanding of how things operate, understanding who the participants are, the fact that business that we do has financial institutions on either side of the transaction, you know, the success of our payment system and our primary competitors is that for a reason.  And there\u2019s certainly some interesting things about Bitcoin and other things like it, but there\u2019s also a great deal of complexity. People talk about things like frictionless and things like that, and when you actually dig through it, it\u2019s really not the case. It\u2019s far more complex than that. And we feel very comfortable with the business that we have here. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair. \nBob Napoli - William Blair: Question on security. And I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have all the answers on this, but if EMV had been in place, would it have prevented some of the recent breaches? And just in line with the trend in security, it seems like there are these dates out there that tend to get pushed back. Do you think that the breach at Target and others, do you sense it\u2019s going to drive the adoption of EMV and other security faster than it otherwise would have? Are you seeing action taking place that wasn\u2019t happening 30 days ago?\nCharlie Scharf : Well, the second part of your question, I think the answer is yes. You know, people don\u2019t live in a vacuum, and when you see the kinds of breaches that have occurred recently, it gets everyone focused on making sure that we\u2019re doing all that we can to minimize any potential fraud in the future.  So the dates that we had set out are the dates that we are going to stick with. Again, it requires people do a lot of work, which we understand, but we think it\u2019s good for the payment system, for the ultimate end user, which means it will ultimately be good for all of us, in the process. On your first piece, remember, first of all, in terms of what actually has happened with the breaches that we\u2019ve read about, not all the facts are out yet. So it\u2019s a little premature for all of us to talk about what would have solved it.  I think it\u2019s fair to say that as best we can tell, some of the breaches that you\u2019ve read about don\u2019t relate to the payment systems at all. They relate to breaches within companies\u2019 server environments, or some personal information, so EMV would obviously have nothing to do with that.  To the extent that there were breaches occurring on the point of sale device, it\u2019s probable that the account number possibly would have been able to be compromised, but the ability to reuse that account number to create a new card, to use that card at a physical point of sale on a fraudulent basis, would not be possible. It would still be possible to use that account number potentially at card not present, which is why it\u2019s important that the industry also continue to push forward with tokenization.\nOperator: Tom McCrohan from Janney Capital Markets, you may ask your question.\nTom McCrohan - Janney Capital Markets: Is V.me being positioned as a mobile wallet long term? Or is it more kind of a tender type for ecommerce transactions, something more like a Paypal?\nCharlie Scharf : I think of V.me very simply as a way for our customers to have an easy way to make payments online with their general purpose credit card, through user name and password. So people like to ask is it a wallet? Is it this? Is it that? It\u2019s really not that complicated. It\u2019s when you are buying on your computer, your tablet, or on your mobile device, right now it\u2019s not easy to get from the beginning of the checkout process to the end of the checkout process using our products. \n :\nOperator: Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.\nTien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan : I had a quick follow up on the breach, then I had a cross-border question. Just on the breach, any risk of indirect impact from consumer [confidence] changing maybe in terms of usage of card, maybe mix shift to credit, or just reissuance risk in general. And then on cross-border, I know there\u2019s a lot of discussion in the market around emerging markets, FX volatility. Can that have any impact on cross-border activity or profitability? What should we be considering there? And then lastly, cross border, on the World Cup front and with the Olympics, is that enough to show up in cross-border volumes?\nCharlie Scharf : Why don\u2019t I start with the first? Consumer confidence and using the cards, which we pay very close attention to, continues to still look very, very good. We\u2019ve actually done our own surveys, starting at the time of the breach. One of the reasons why we ran the advertising that we ran to make sure that consumers understand that, while it\u2019s unpleasant and not something that we want them to go through, they\u2019re actually protected. And in terms of what we\u2019ve seen in our actual payment results and these surveys, things continue to look pretty good for us.\nByron Pollitt : On the cross-border front, logic would say that depending on how currencies move, it should have an impact on cross-border. The way it tends to materialize, and the way we typically think about it, is by corridor.  And yet what we saw this past quarter, despite a broad strengthening of the U.S. dollar, there was actually strong traffic to the United States and strong cross-border spend from countries where the currencies were somewhat weaker relative to the U.S. dollar.  And that\u2019s counterintuitive to what you would normally think. As a result, our view more broadly on cross-border is that it\u2019s economically driven, and that how economic growth globally behaves is more likely to have an impact on our overall cross-border volumes.  So if I were to single out an area, emerging markets, there\u2019s been a lot of focus on declining values and growth rates in emerging markets. Those areas still have been vibrant sources of growth for us, but we have a close watch on that in the year to come.  With regard to World Cup, Brazil has been one of those countries where the currency has weakened, which bodes well for incoming traffic to the World Cup this summer in Brazil. The outbound spend from Brazil is one that will be under pressure, for two reasons. One, the weakness of the currency. That\u2019s often overpowered by an unflagging desire for Brazilians to travel. The government\u2019s making it more difficult, however, by putting on some pretty serious taxes, both on the use of credit and debit cards when they\u2019re used in cross-border transactions.  So I\u2019d say from a World Cup standpoint, hopefully I would expect most of the Brazilians to stay home for the festivities and that outbound travel is probably never much in the cards. Inbound travel, if anything, should be aided by the weakness in the currency in Brazil and possibly Argentina will benefit as well, as their currency has taken a nosedive of late. \nCharlie Scharf : Hard to believe we\u2019ll see anything Sochi.\nByron Pollitt : Yes.\nOperator: The next question will be from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. \nBryan Keane - Deutsche Bank: Just two quick questions. One, I guess, just what\u2019s behind the slowdown in U.S. debit volumes, and any difference between PIN and signature? And secondly, I noticed you guys hide EMV chip, just your latest thoughts on the EMV chip versus the EMV chip and PIN, and will you promote one versus the other?\nByron Pollitt : On the debit side, I\u2019d say hard to read that. There is pretty tepid growth in personal disposable income, which is the primary indicator we look at, now that we\u2019ve pretty much lapped the more immediate Durbin effects. Remember, debit is disproportionately nondiscretionary. So one of the important drivers of debit spend is the growth in jobs, which adds to the overall growth in nondiscretionary and debit spend. And we\u2019re just not seeing much in the way of growth rates there. What we\u2019re seeing is declining growth rates there for the U.S. in that regard. If we were to take a look at Visa signature versus Interlink, I would say the growth rates on the PIN side have been running higher than on the signature side. And as you noticed, we downshifted a bit from where we were in the prior quarter as we began to move further away from the immediate effects of Durbin and begin to hit a more normalized pattern.\nCharlie Scharf :\n. :\nOperator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.\nDarrin Peller - Barclays : We noticed that the service fees were up sequentially. Did anything in pricing or perhaps some lag effects from the [unintelligible] drive that? And then is there anything unsustainable around the amount you\u2019re now generating in service fees per dollar of payment volume? And then just quickly, on the topic of pricing, we clearly saw a pretty significant cross-border price change at Mastercard over the last couple of quarters. While I know you guys want to be careful and surgical on pricing changes, especially [unintelligible], might there be some similar opportunities soon from Visa? \nByron Pollitt : On the service fee side, I would say there\u2019s no real callout. Remember, a lot of our service fee is subject to FX impacts. So if we look at the constant dollar growth in service fees, we\u2019re at 13, the FX impact bringing that down to about 10 nominally. And service fee growth was around 9. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty close. So I\u2019d say there\u2019s no real callout on the yields. It\u2019s well within a zipcode of what we have done within the past three or four quarters. So no callouts. \nCharlie Scharf : And on the pricing question, I answer it very consistently with what we\u2019ve been saying. We are not opposed to increase in price, we\u2019re not opposed to decrease in price, we\u2019re not opposed to keeping price the same, as long as there\u2019s a reason for all of those things. So I think we have been disciplined, we\u2019ve been thoughtful, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. And I guess the last thing I would say is we are more than willing to sacrifice our short term performance versus other people if it\u2019s the right long term thing to do for our company and for our industry. And so we\u2019re very comfortable with what we\u2019ve done and what we haven\u2019t done in pricing.\nOperator: Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies, your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg - Jefferies : If I heard correctly, I think processed transaction growth slowed a little bit in the first three weeks of January, 11% versus the 13% last quarter. So wanted to get a little bit more color there in terms of kind of U.S. versus international trends. And then just quickly switching gears, any thoughts in terms of the implications of the data breaches on MCX\u2019s potential strategy? I know you guys get a lot of questions around that, but to the extent they were looking at private label or decoupled debit product as a primary funding source in their wallet now, with the potential for consumers to be more wary about giving their bank account data to a retailer. Would just appreciate any thoughts you have around that.\nByron Pollitt : Let me start with the transaction growth. And let me break it down U.S. versus international, give it to you for the first quarter, and then for January, so that you have the detail. So as I said on the call, processed transaction growth for the first quarter was 13%, U.S. was 9%, and international was 26%. January, 21 days, processed transaction growth was 11. 7 for the U.S., 24 for international. So a downtick in both. \nCharlie Scharf : And I guess just to add a touch of color on that, because we obviously look at these numbers daily, weekly. We look at all the trends. And the one thing that we talk about over the past several months, and it really goes back to the beginning of last quarter, is there\u2019s a lot of volatility embedded in the numbers. Week in, week out, it\u2019s very hard to pick up trends. And so whether they\u2019re positive or negative over a several week period of time, we\u2019ve been unable to discern anything more meaningful than this continued tepid recovery that Byron described. And then on the second question, I guess I would say what we continue to say. And I\u2019ve talked about this fairly consistently. As we think about our competitive position, understanding that we\u2019re continuing to evolve and change and make sure that we open our network up to those who can direct transactions to us and continue to build value on our network.  Having said all that, safety, security, and soundness is the price of entry in payments. There\u2019s no question about that. And people can build whatever they want, and the moment that consumers start to get nervous about using their own personal information or payment credentials is the moment that people will start to see the effect of that.  And so what we and our primary competitors have are these established payment networks, known rules, people understand how they\u2019re protected, which is why we think EMV is important, because it takes mag stripe to a new standard, and we\u2019re pushing beyond EMV towards the next thing. And so to the extent that other payment methods are not as secure, that is a competitive disadvantage. And that\u2019s how we think about it. \nOperator: Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW, please ask your question.\nSanjay Sakhrani - KBW : Just had a question on the FX hedging practices going forward. How should we think about the relevance of them as currencies move going forward, especially if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen more?\nByron Pollitt : According to the [forwards], the U.S. dollar is strengthening more against the currencies that are most relevant in our portfolio. So the forwards aren\u2019t as steep as what we were looking at a year ago, but nonetheless, to the extent there has been a headwind, I would say looking forward, the headwind continues. It\u2019s just not as steep as it was when we looked out six, nine months ago. We begin hedging a year ahead of time. So we hedge 12 months out. We do rolling hedges. So we begin 12 months out, and then our hedges are largely in place, I would say, five or six months before the period we actually report. We do economic hedges, so we don\u2019t hedge everything. For a particular currency, we take revenue, subtract the natural hedge of the expenses we incur in that currency, and then we hedge not 100%, but a meaningful portion of the remainder, and we do that for about 15 currencies.  The intent is not to speculate, but to simply dampen the impact of currencies. And the way we approach it, it\u2019s not possible to put complete hedges in place. The intent is to put enough in to dampen it within certain predetermined exposures that we calculate. It\u2019s a pretty straightforward value at risk analysis. So when there are large sustained movements, those are going to be reflected in our numbers. They just won\u2019t have the amplitude that you would have if we didn\u2019t hedge. We have pretty good visibility to this, which is why we can give you a three to four quarter look ahead, which is our practice from a guidance standpoint.\nOperator: Craig Maurer with CLSA, your line is open. \nCraig Maurer - CLSA: First is for Byron. If you could discuss the cadence in marketing spend. Will the ramp look similar to what we saw during the last Olympic Games? Though I do know you have two events coming up. And secondly, does [host card] emulation present a good tool for your tokenization project in the card not present world? And would you move quickly toward certification there?\nCharlie Scharf : Let me just do number two first, because the answer is yes.\nByron Pollitt : And on the second one, I don\u2019t have a comparison, but you should expect a significant increase in marketing spend in Q2 and Q3, and then a meaningful downshift in Q4. We\u2019ve had this combination before, and even though the finals of the World Cup are typically in July, which is Q4, there is a substantial amount of marketing that occurs prior to the finals in that April, May, June timeframe. So that quarter has a substantial component of the World Cup, and this quarter is the one that has virtually all of the Winter Olympics spend. One other callout, the spend for Winter Olympics is significant in terms of the quarterly cadence, but it is not at the level of spend that you would see for a Summer Olympics. \nCharlie Scharf : Let me just reiterate what Byron said in his opening remarks, just to make sure that we were as clear as we can be. As we look to our fiscal second and third quarters, in the second and third quarters, because of what Byron referred to, our revenue growth numbers will not be as robust as we\u2019ve seen this quarter and in the fourth quarter.  We said that we expect the expense growth to be higher in the second and third quarters because of the marketing numbers that Byron talked about. And that obviously then flows through to weaker margins in the second and third quarters, recovering in the fourth quarter for things that we know are coming, which is why we reaffirmed full year guidance. But there will be these variable and lumpy trends as we see the year play itself out. \nOperator: Ken Bruce, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, you may ask your question. \nKen Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: My question is relatively simple. It may not be quite as simple of an answer, but I\u2019m hoping to get a little bit of perspective around the processed transactions. Just in terms of the percentage that has basically been migrating slowly higher, I was hoping you might be able to dimensionalize what is driving that share increase in terms of processed transactions, what are the contributors to that, and maybe what you think is a reasonable high end for processed transactions. And then separately, if you would provide any color around the merchant relationships that you mentioned in your opening remarks, in terms of improving those relationships and what that might entail.\nByron Pollitt : I think that\u2019s a pretty straightforward, simple question, on the processed transactions part, for sure. Two dimensions here. First of all, when you look at the relative growth rates between U.S. and international, the international is growing at a multiple of the U.S. growth rate. When you break down international, if you took a snapshot of our portfolio today, international for us is still largely a credit business. That\u2019s what got established first. When you look at what\u2019s driving the transaction growth, it is very clearly debit and that is the huge opportunity that will drive international transaction growth for years to come. For us, debit is still in its infancy internationally relative to the United States. Another dimension: in the United States, we process nearly 100% of our transactions. Outside of the United States, we can process anywhere from 90% to 0%. And so the opportunity for us to Visa process transactions is still a wide open field. And that, by the way, is particularly true in debit. So you will hear us talk a lot more about that in the quarters to come, because it\u2019s linked so directly to our growth opportunity.\nCharlie Scharf : And on the merchant question, we don\u2019t have anything that we want to talk publicly about now with any individual merchant, but as I said in the opening remarks, our goal is to provide the kinds of value-added services for merchants that we have done such a good job of providing to the issuing community for a long period of time. And we\u2019re in the process of having discussions, and when we have specifics to talk about, we\u2019ll talk about them.\nOperator: [Operator instructions.] And the next one will come from Smitti Srethapramote, Morgan Stanley. \nSmittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley: Can you please give us an update on your government relations efforts in emerging markets to increase the electronification of payments?\nCharlie Scharf : First of all, government relations for us, especially when you get outside of the developed world, is not a traditional government relations function. It\u2019s not a staff function that sits to the side and just goes around and has lobbying types of conversations. In the emerging markets, government relations is a business for us, because the government is our partner in helping electronify the payment systems in these particular markets. Very often, when the government leads with trying to move their transactions to the electronic payment systems, that then can help drive the market. That\u2019s what we see in places like Rwanda and other places, which are really emerging. And so when you look across the world, we think of the government as a client and a partner to helping build a business which is good for them. And the reason why it\u2019s good for them is it\u2019s ultimately good for all of their participants, whether it\u2019s the merchants or the individuals, and obviously we and our competitors will benefit from that, as cash exits society.\nByron Pollitt : If I were to reflect back to when we went public in 2008, and if you were to have asked that question, I don\u2019t think anyone would have thought to ask that question. But today, governments of emerging markets have gotten a lot more interested and pay a lot more attention to electronic forms of payment. They\u2019re interested in it from a very self-serving standpoint in that you can\u2019t tax what you can\u2019t see, but they\u2019re also very focused on this is a way of providing, in Charlie\u2019s words, a safer, more secure and sound financial system for their citizens.  And so there\u2019s a natural tendency to want to regulate, and our involvement now is very, very early contact with a broad range of emerging market governments, because they can be very well intentioned but also unenlightened in regard to how to think about regulation, and what the impacts are.  And so we have got government relations people stationed all over the world, particularly in emerging markets, and their role is largely educational, so that governments that have a legitimate interest in regulating this part of their monetary system can do so understanding how best to provide safety, security, and soundness and to allow the market to operate so that they get the kind of penetration of electronic payments, which will grow and be healthy.  And we\u2019ve been exceptionally pleased with the reception of most governments to talking with us and partnering with us to develop their electronic payment systems in a way that\u2019s healthy and I think will provide a good foundation for growth to come. \nOperator: Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer, you may ask your question.\nGlenn Greene - Oppenheimer : As you renewed your Chase deal, I think the implication, or you suggested that you\u2019d pick up some incremental volume. I was curious if you\u2019ve started to see that, and should we be thinking about that as sort of being reflected in the run rate or something that we could expect going forward throughout calendar \u201914 as sort of incremental volume? And then just a quick number question, in terms of where are you in terms of V.me merchants signed.\nByron Pollitt : On Chase, we do expect to see incremental volume during the course of the year. We expect some to begin this quarter, not material, and we expect it to build through the course of fiscal year \u201914. In our guidance, that incremental is contemplated, but it will be more second half weighted, clearly, than first half.\nCharlie Scharf : And on V.me merchants, I don\u2019t have the updated number here, to be honest with you. \nGlenn Greene - Oppenheimer : Do we sort of get a step function increase at some point during this year, or is it sort of gradual, test mode, kind of figuring it out?\nCharlie Scharf : We\u2019ll be in a position to answer that question in another month or two, because we\u2019ve just rolled out the new platform that I described. And we\u2019ll start to see the effect of it, and have a better understanding of what it means for the ramp up.\nOperator: Next we have Chris Brendler of Stifel.\nChris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus : I have two questions that I probably won\u2019t get a lot of detail on, so hopefully it won\u2019t take too long. One is Visa Europe, anything you can say additionally about Visa Europe and what potentially that would look like if it could come back to you? Any progress there? Any updates?  And then similarly, on the Judge Leon case and the appeal, obviously you can\u2019t give us too much there, but I was wondering if there was any way you could, on a timeline, it sounded like from that hearing that the timeline could be shorter than I think the original estimates that were somewhere around a year. Is it possible we could hear something from the three judge appeal panel in the next couple of months? \nCharlie Scharf : Nothing different to talk about on Visa Europe. Otherwise, I would have mentioned it in my opening remarks. And on timing, we don\u2019t know, on the appeal.\nJack Carsky : And in terms of the last question, we\u2019ve got the numbers. We have over 300 signed, and 80 are currently live, on the V.me.\nOperator: Next we have a question from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous.\nGlenn Fodor - Autonomous Research : Byron, just wanted to peel back your comments on emerging markets a little bit more. Can you give us a rough sense of what percent of your volumes come from emerging markets? And then within that volume category, can you give us a range of what type of multiple to your overall volume growth that this is growing? Is it three times as fast, or four times?\nByron Pollitt : I don\u2019t actually have those statistics at my command. The emerging markets, these growth rates are midteens and better. \nCharlie Scharf : And depending on the market, it could be substantially better than that.\nByron Pollitt : Yes, and could be substantially better. And these growth rates, we have a portfolio. So even though some of these have had currency issues in terms of weakening currencies, these growth rates have held pretty well even where there has been weaker currencies. Government intervention, where they\u2019re trying to limit the outbound, can have an effect. You\u2019re seeing that in Brazil today. Likely to see it in Argentina, Venezuela, countries where there have been more severe locations. But the durability of the growing cross-border in emerging markets has been quite resilient.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Quick question on the cybersource transaction growth, which decelerated in the first fiscal quarter. Any commentary just broadly around that, and implications or read throughs to overall ecommerce volume?\nByron Pollitt : Let me separate the two. On ecommerce volume, this was a fantastic holiday spend season for ecommerce. And the trend in growth and ecom is very, very healthy. And so the downshift a bit in the growth in cybersource has nothing to do with the underlying growth in ecommerce. What I would say the cybersource established an early significant position as a gateway in what has become a much more competitive space. And I think what we\u2019re going to find in the next few quarters is that we\u2019re going to need to up our game and that this space is just going to be more competitively intense than it has been in the past couple of years. And that is a direct testament to how attractive the growth prospects are for ecom, which is the one channel that is particularly suited for electronic payments.\nJack Carsky : And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And as always, if you have any follow up questions, please feel free to give either Victoria or myself a call.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Dexter. Good early morning, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call and Visa Europe acquisition discussion. With us today from London are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Nicolas Huss, Visa Europe's Chief Executive Officer; while here in California we have Vasant Prabhu, Visa Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer. This call is being currently webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for the next 30 days. PowerPoint decks containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's earnings commentary and an overview of the Visa Europe transaction were posted to our website prior to this call. Let me also remind you that these presentations may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP or pro forma-related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks a lot, Jack, and greetings from London. It's great to have Nicolas here as well, you'll be hearing from him in just a little bit. We certainly appreciate the early hours especially for those on the West Coast this morning. Given our announcement regarding Europe, we thought it was important to do the call as early as possible given the desire to communicate with our clients, employees and partners here in Europe. We're quite excited about our announcement and have a full agenda, so we'll try and move through our prepared material quickly, leaving plenty of time for Q&A at the end. We have six topics to talk about this morning. First, we reported a solid fourth quarter and strong year-end to fiscal 2015. Second, we'll view our outlook for the fiscal 2016 year on a standalone basis. Third, I have some brief comments on previously announced dividend increase. And fourth, we announced the acquisition of Visa Europe. As you know, we have been clear that this was a transaction that we thought made tremendous sense for both our company but also for Visa Europe and its members, so we're thrilled to be able to move forward as one company. And with the Visa Europe acquisition, we announced two other items regarding our capital structure. First, our board has improved an increase to buyback authorization to bring the total available to $7.8 billion. And second, we announced that we will implement a new capital structure for the company. We intend to raise $15 billion to $16 billion of debt in conjunction with the Visa Europe announcement, but you'll see that we view this as a trigger to implement a more efficient long-term capital structure for the company. We'll first talk about our earnings results and outlook for 2016, then we'll discuss the Visa Europe acquisition and our capital actions, leaving time for questions. And with that, I'll turn it back to Vasant.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, we have a lot to talk about on this call. I will only comment briefly on our fourth quarter and 2015 results and spend most of my time giving you as comprehensive a picture as we can of our outlook for fiscal 2016. We're pleased to report another strong quarter and full fiscal year results with solid revenue and earnings growth. Our high growth in a tepid global environment demonstrates yet again the fundamental resilience of our business model. Results were generally in line with our expectations going into the quarter with a few call-outs. First, our core metrics remained robust around the globe. The underlying secular conversion from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment continue at a fast clip as demonstrated by high domestic payment volume growth rates. This is obscured by the significant drag caused by the strengthening of the dollar against most major currencies over the course of the year. In the fourth quarter, this impact worsened as the dollar strengthened further against key currencies. This hurts us not only in currency translation terms but also in slowing cross-border volume growth. Second, as expected, client incentive levels in the quarter came in at 18.4%, well above the full year run rate of 17.1%. This sets us up well for fiscal 2016 payments volume growth. Several key renewals as well as a couple of significant wins will drive the incentive rate higher in 2016. I'll talk more about this when I discuss our outlook for 2016. Third, expense growth was somewhat higher than we had anticipated due to a legal settlement in Australia and Visa Europe transaction costs. This cost us about $0.01 of EPS in the quarter. Finally, we did not repurchase stock in the quarter due to the Visa Europe conversations that were underway. For the full year we repurchased 44.1 million shares at a price of just under $66 per share for a total of $2.9 billion. We currently have authorization to repurchase up to $2.8 billion of stock under our prior plan and an incremental $5 million recently authorized by our board. Moving on to the quarter's business drivers and our financial results, global payments volume growth in constant dollars for the September quarter continued to be strong at 12%. U.S. credit grew 10%, moderating 2% compared to the June quarter as the positive effects of Chase conversion wane. U.S. debit grew at 9%, up 3 points from June. So gasoline prices continue to have a significant negative effect of approximately 2 percentage points growth in Interlink volume tied to certain routing wins offset a significant portion of the gas impact. International payments volume constant dollar growth of 15% was up over the prior quarter, with increases posted in all regions and more specifically followed by the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa and Mexico. More recently through October 28, U.S. payments volume growth was 9%, with U.S. credit growing 9%, and debit 10%, a slight downtick in credit and uptick in debit versus the fourth quarter. Global cross-border volume growth declined to 5% after three consecutive quarters of 8% constant dollar growth. As has been the case for several quarters now, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is negatively impacting key corridors of cross-border commerce. Specifically, outbound commerce from Russia, Canada and Brazil have deteriorated further in the past few months. While growth rates were still high in Q4, outbound commerce from China has seen a moderation in trend. Inbound commerce into the U.S. continue to drift lower in August and September. The bright spots are outbound commerce from the U.S. and the Middle East, commerce into Europe has been growing for most regions but as you know, we do not benefit as much from it currently. Despite the slowdown in cross-border payment volume growth and the significant negative drag from currency translation, international revenues grew 16%, helped by the previously announced pricing action and continued high currency volatility. Overall, growth was relatively \u2013 was impacted relatively equally by pricing and currency volatility. Through October 28, cross-border volume growth on a constant dollar basis has slowed further to 3%, in line with the August/September trend. Transactions processed over VisaNet totaled 18 billion in the fourth quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period and unchanged from the June quarter. The U.S. delivered 11% growth while international growth was flat. International processed transaction growth is 13% when you normalize for the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April. Through October 28, process transaction growth was 8% with a U.S. rate of 11% and an international growth rate that remained flat, the international rate of course being impacted by Russia. Overall, we had a strong finish to another solid year of top and bottom line growth. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.6 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year in constant dollars or 11% in nominal dollars. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was up 12% on a constant currency basis over 9% in nominal dollars. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $0.62, a 16% increase in constant dollars or 14% on a nominal basis over the prior year's adjusted results. For the fiscal full year, diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 18% on a constant currency basis, almost 16% in nominal dollars. With that, I'll move on to our outlook for fiscal 2016. Starting with payment volumes. Payment volumes globally have grown around 11% in constant dollars for the past two years. As we look ahead to 2016, we are anticipating an uptick in growth driven by the U.S. Most of the step-up in the U.S. growth rate is expected in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 and beyond. The first quarter trend should be generally in line with what we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As we enter the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we begin to fully lap the big gas price declines from last year. In the second half, USAA conversions are expected to start and then late in the fiscal year, Costco conversion should commence. Offsetting these to some extent will be the end of JPMorgan conversion gains. Outside the U.S., easier comparisons in our Latin America and CEMEA regions as they lap the sharp declines last year, and Brazil and Russia should help reported growth rates. If all this plays out as we expect, global payments volume growth will accelerate in 2016, ramping as the year progresses and setting us up nicely for 2017. Moving on to the cross-border business. Cross-border volumes, as you all know, are dependent on global economic conditions and the relative strength of key currencies, most particularly the U.S. dollar. In fiscal year 2015, we experienced sharp declines in outbound cross-border volume growth due to both these factors in key markets like Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil and Russia, starting late in the first quarter and worsening as the year progressed. Our large U.S. inbound business also declined as the dollar gained strength. And in the fourth quarter, Chinese outbound volume started to soften. Through the first half of fiscal 2016, we are not anticipating any meaningful improvement in cross-border growth rates from current levels. As we enter the second half, comparisons are easier and if the dollar stays stable or weakens, we could see an uptick in growth. Net-net, we expect the cross-border business will remain sluggish in the first half. Dollar strength and macroeconomic conditions will determine the second half. On balance, we are planning for improved cross-border growth rate in the second half of fiscal 2016. While cross-border growth slowed in FY 2015, currency volatility hit new highs as the year progressed, serving as a significant offset. Year-over-year growth rates were accentuated by the unusually low levels of volatility experienced in the second half of 2014. Speculation about Fed rate increases in the U.S., the sharp decline in commodity prices, uncertainty about Chinese growth, Greece, et cetera, all contributed to keep currency markets guessing. Given the high levels experienced in 2015, it seems very unlikely that volatility will be a tailwind again in 2016. Volatility has moderated in recent weeks and, although uncertainties persist, one might project a reversion to the mean for the year. Given all this, we are assuming that currency volatility will be a headwind throughout fiscal 2016 and significantly so as the year progresses when comparisons get a lot tougher. Processed transaction growth rates dipped from 10% in the first half to 8% in the second half as we transferred domestic processing to NSPK in Russia. About half of the domestic transactions shifted in Q3 and all domestic transactions in Q4 fiscal 2015. This will continue to impact reported transaction growth rates through the first three quarters of FY 2016. As we enter the second half, U.S. transaction growth rates will rise as we bring on USAA and then Costco volume. Moving to client incentives. In 2015, client incentives came in at 17.1% of gross revenue, below our expected range of 17.5% to 18.5%. This was due to volume shortfalls in markets like Russia and Brazil, delays in renewals, and some shift to dollars from incentives to gross price reductions. We anticipate a step-up in client incentives in fiscal year 2016 based on renewals completed to date and renewals anticipated in 2016, as well as the conversion of USAA and Costco. Among the significant renewals completed in 2015 were core brands like Southwest and United, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank in North America, large issuers in Russia, Japan, and Latin America. USAA-related incentives will kick in midyear and Costco later in the year. In 2016, we also expect several large renewals. Our current expectation is that client incentives as a percent of gross revenue could climb to the middle of the 17.5% to 18.5% range. The first quarter in particular should see a high level of renewal activity and the largest impact from renewals worldwide. The Q1 incentive rate will likely be at the high end of the full year range or possibly higher. With incentives growing faster than gross revenue, net revenue growth will lag gross revenue growth. In constant dollars, we anticipate fiscal year 2016 net revenue growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Also, based on all the factors I discussed earlier, the first quarter growth rate will likely be 2 percentage points lower than the full year growth rate, with growth picking up as the year progresses. As a reminder, our service revenues lapped one quarter from payment volumes whereas incentives are booked in the quarter in which payment volumes occur. Which brings us to the currency translation impact from the strengthening dollar. The fiscal year 2015 impact of exchange rates was a 2.5 percentage point drag on net revenues, higher than we had anticipated at the start of the year. If we look at where the dollar is today and the basket of currencies we are exposed to, the FY 2016 impact looks to be 3 percentage points. The bulk of this impact is in currencies like the ruble, the real, the Venezuelan bolivar, the Argentinean peso, and the Canadian and Aussie dollars. On the expense front, we will continue to invest in key growth initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service and other strategic programs as well as our long-term plan to bring key technology and customer service activities that are currently outsourced in-house. Network-related expenses will grow due to the full year impact of fees paid to NSPK for processing transactions in Russia. We will start to lap this added expense in Q4 2016. We will have significant startup costs to set up domestic operations in China. We are actively working on being in a position to compete domestically and will submit our application upon release of the final regulations. We are assuming China startup expenses will ramp through the year. We are holding the line on cost increases in all overhead functions. In nominal dollars, we expect a step-down in the rate of expense growth in fiscal year 2016 as a result of all these actions versus almost 6% growth in fiscal year 2015. Expense growth will run at a high single-digit clip in the first half and substantially lower in the second half. Our tax rate in 2015 came in at an adjusted 29.3%, almost 100 basis points lower than expected due to the favorable resolution of some tax items. As always, there are various tax initiatives underway. However, we expect our tax rate to normalize in fiscal year 2016 back to the low 30%s. In FY 2015, the lower than expected tax rate added over 1 percentage point to our EPS growth. In FY 2016, the anticipated increase in the rate could be as much as a 2 point drag on EPS growth. Now that we've announced the Visa Europe transaction, we can resume our stock buyback. It is fully our intent to step up the pace of buybacks immediately to make up for buybacks not completed in Q4 FY 2015. Despite this, our weighted average share count in 2016 will be higher than it would have been had we been buyers of our stock in the fourth quarter of 2015. When you put this all together, we expect our constant currency EPS growth in fiscal year 2016 to come in at the low end of the mid-teens range. Without the expected increase in the tax rate, EPS growth rates would be almost 2 percentage points higher. Furthermore, the currency translation impact will be higher on earnings than it is on revenue. We project a 4 percentage point drag on EPS growth from exchange rates. This is due to two main reasons. First, a larger proportion of our expenses are dollar denominated; and second, profits relative to revenues are proportionately higher in some of the higher rate (19:32) currencies. The first quarter EPS growth rate will be significantly lower in the mid-single digits for all the reasons I outlined earlier, a net revenue growth rate in Q1 that tracks a couple of percentage points below the full year run rate and an expense growth rate that will run meaningfully higher than the full year run rate. The EPS growth rate will step up as the year progresses except in the fiscal third quarter when we lapped a large tax benefit last year. As you can see, there are a variety of factors that will drive our revenue and EPS growth in fiscal year 2016. The key underlying drivers of our business remain very healthy. We expect a step-up in payments volume growth, major new accounts and renewals, good expense control resulting in healthy core revenue and earnings growth in constant dollars despite a generally uneven global economy. We have several significant factors driving down our reported growth rate in FY 2016 which should moderate with time. These are a potential regression to the meaningful currency volatilities, the continuing strength of the dollar impacting both the cross-border business and creating a currency translation drag, and a return to normalized tax rates. As the impact of these unfavorable year-over-year comparisons fades, the strong underlying growth momentum of our core business positions us well for robust reported growth in fiscal year 2017. We remain as bullish as we've ever been about the long-term secular trends in our business. As always, we will update our views as the year unfolds and share them with you each quarter. This outlook excludes the Visa Europe acquisition. When I come back, I'll walk through the potential financial impact of Visa Europe on fiscal year 2016. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Charlie.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks very much, Vasant. I'll try and keep my comments brief so we can move on to Europe. First of all, we're very happy with our performance both in the quarter and 2015. We continued to deliver strong results in a global economic environment which still has more headwinds than tailwinds for us. Adjusted earnings per share growth of 14% in the quarter and 16% for the full year include the continuing negative effects of a series of items, including the translation impact of a strong U.S. dollar, reduced cross-border volume driven by that strong dollar, and continuing drag from lower oil prices. Of course, there are positive offsets including strong payment volume, healthy processed transaction growth, and high currency volatility. Our strong results in the face of these pluses and minuses speak to the resilience of our business model. Regarding what we see across the world, I'll keep it simple and just say that the economic environment has shown little change over the last quarter, with some slight deterioration especially outside of the United States. Having said that, domestic activity is still fairly strong. And while we didn't get much help from an accelerating economic environment, our business still showed continued strong growth. Our longer term bullish growth outlook is intact and, most importantly, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to deliver, and these will continue to drive continued growth. We'll discuss capital in much more detail when we review the Europe transaction but I do want to comment on our recent dividend increase. We've discussed our view that the dividend is an important way for us to return capital to our shareholders. We've also said that we would hope to consistently grow the dividend as we grow the earnings of the company, and the recent 17% increase maintains the payout at our stated target range of below 20%s. Most importantly, we feel it's a strong statement that we're increasing our dividend at the same time that we're announcing such a significant transaction. Now, let me turn and make some comments about the fundamentals of our business. We continued strength in our key client relationships across the world. In the United States we're in a great position. Over the course of the year, we extended some of our biggest relationships which were up for renewal, including our partnership with Wells Fargo which we renewed just this quarter. We now have partnership agreements in place with five of our top six until at least 2020. Outside of the U.S., we're also in a very strong position. We continue to expand our relationships with clients around the world. For example, in Australia, we signed a new 10-year exclusive partnership with the National Australian Bank. While we did had some notable losses this year, we also had successes winning significant new business with Costco and USAA. I want to just make a couple of observations about how we view pricing and share in this context. First of all and, most importantly, we view the big opportunity for us is to drive growth in the marketplace, and therefore, the most profitable growth is achieved by electronifying cash and check across the world, expanding participates in the electronic payments universe, and helping grow commerce more broadly. We believe this is how we create real long-term sustainable value. If you look at what's driven our revenue growth over the last several years, it's just that, not taking share from competitors. That's not to say the market isn't competitive; it is. And as you know, our competitors are very, very good and we respect them. And since we went public, you've seen clients make long-term partnership decisions, some of which have benefited us, others of which have benefited others. There will be situations where clients seek to do more business with us because of our capabilities, products and brand, and we will support them. We'll also defend our share aggressively. We will be competitive with the market but we do not seek to win deals solely on price. We do not view pricing on its own as the best mechanism to grow. So, I strongly believe in focusing on long-term value creation and that our future is about growing electronic payments and commerce broadly, and ultimately expanding into new or underpenetrated segments. Now, a few comments on the underlying business. Visa Checkout continues to gain momentum. We now have more than 7 million registered users in 16 countries, and over 470 financial institutions partners participating globally. More than 250,000 merchants are currently live globally including 10 of the top 50 e-commerce merchants. New merchant partners include Kohl's, Best Buy, Shutterfly, Lands' End, Fanatics, and Abercrombie & Fitch, to name a few. We also announced that we now have built the ability for issuers and merchants to tokenize Visa Checkout transactions. We expect this to begin in early 2016, as merchants and some issuers complete the work required to enable token acceptance. Many issuers are ready now, but given the rapid approach of the holiday season, we do not expect merchants to enable token acceptance as they head into their year-end annual system freezes. Second, as you all know, we partnered with Google and Samsung to bring two great new mobile experiences to market. Android Pay and Samsung Pay both launched their solutions in the U.S. in September and, in the upcoming months, will roll out their programs internationally. Third, we continue to build out our technology capabilities to deliver differentiated services in the marketplace. In September, we launched Visa Integrated Marketing Solutions, a card marketing platform designed to help small- to medium-sized issuers optimize their marketing efforts. It's a service offered by Visa Performance Solutions, which provides a range of advisory services to issuers, merchants, and acquirers, and is currently available to any Visa issuer in the United States interested in increasing their performance of their Visa consumer credit or debit portfolios, and the platform is expected to extend globally in the coming months. Last month, CyberSource launched Decision Manager Replay, the industry's first fraud tuning analytics tool which allows merchants to quickly analyze and adjust their online fraud management strategies. Merchants could take a batch of recent transactions and run them through the Decision Manager system, re-testing for fraud using more or less stringent risk levels. The system can reconfirm which transactions are fraudulent and which ones have been mistakenly flagged for fraud and denied but were in fact valid. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, let me just share a couple of thoughts following Vasant's. Our guidance for 2016 is reflective of several things. First of all, it excludes the impact of Visa Europe, which will make the second half of our fiscal year more complicated. We will do our best to isolate the impacts for you so you can understand the impacts discretely and evaluate our sustainable performance. While we cannot predict the future any better than you can, we do have to make assumptions as we plan for the year. We have shared these in a fair amount of detail with you in addition to providing the numerical guidance but, at some point, you need to make your own determinations. Having said that, there are some things that I want to emphasize from Vasant's remarks. The effects of the strong dollar will have an increased negative effect on us in 2016 but there will be a point when the dollar stabilizes and we lap this effect. As Vasant said, we are planning for negative 3-point impact on revenue growth and 4 points on EPS growth in 2016 before we hope to see some improvement. Cross-border weakness continues but can change quickly with movements in the dollar and domestic economic growth. And please pay attention to Vasant's comments on timing. While we don't usually get as specific as we've done on this call, we do have some line of sight which would suggest that some of the items Vasant spoke about should impact the early part of the year disproportionally, especially Q1. Having said that, we always look through our results and ask what has changed about our views on growth beyond the fiscal year. We continue to feel great about our opportunity to drive revenue, earnings, and EPS growth for our shareholders. There's more cash to disintermediate than ever and we have more tools than ever to accomplish. And with that, let me switch gears and talk a bit about the Visa Europe transaction. Today, as you've seen, we announced that we and Visa Europe have entered into a definitive agreement for Visa Inc. to acquire Visa Europe. We're thrilled about the prospect to bring these two companies together and believe the transaction will benefit all involved. I'll give an overview of the transaction starting on page three of the prepared presentation, if you want to follow along. Nicolas will add some comments. After that, Vasant will cover the financial aspects in more detail before we take questions on all topics covered on the call here. We will acquire Visa Europe for an upfront consideration of \u20ac16.5 billion consisting of \u20ac11.5 billion in cash and \u20ac5 billion in convertible preferred stock. In addition, Visa Europe member-owners will potential receive an earn-out payment of up to \u20ac4 billion and \u20ac0.7 billion in interest. This earn-out will be based on the achievement of net revenue targets during the 2016 fiscal quarters following the close and provides additional upside to both parties if those agreed targets are met. It will be payable following the fourth anniversary of the transaction close. We plan to issue between $15 billion and $16 billion in senior unsecured debt to finance the transaction and establish a more efficient long-term capital structure. We plan to offset the effect of the issuance of preferred stock with increased stock buybacks and believe our capital structure will still provide us flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities, and as you know, this is obviously an attractive time to issue debt given the historically low interest rates. Our initial leverage will be between 1.4 and 1.5 times gross debt-to-EBITDA, and we target our long-term leverage at between 1.1 and 1.5 times gross debt-to-EBITDA. Based on discussions held with the rating agencies, we expect to maintain our current investment credit ratings of A+ and A1. The transaction has been approved by both Visa Inc. and the Visa Europe boards will result from the exercise of the amended put option and does not require VI or VE shareholder votes. It is subject to customary closing conditions and transaction regulatory approvals and we expect to close in the third fiscal quarter of 2016. Moving on to page four. Turning to the transaction rationale behind the transaction, this is obviously strategically important for both of us. We believe the combination will create significant benefits for both European and Visa Inc. clients. They will benefit as we work every day to earn their business bringing them the full power of our global platform, innovative products and services, as well as our world-class brand. The transaction will provide European clients with direct access to our investments in technology, differentiated products and services, capital, and talent. We'll also prioritize European needs in the allocation of our resources, and we believe we can deliver a stronger set of digital capabilities than would be possible without this combination. And with that, let me turn it over to Nicolas for him to add his perspective.\nNicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.: Thank you, Charlie. A few comments from a European perspective. The first one is that the time is right. Payments are increasingly global with more and more power from competition, scale and investment capacity are also increasingly important. Adding to this dynamic is regulation which you're all well aware is a key focus for our company and industry. We're now seeing the worlds of payment becoming more global from consumers traveling and shopping across borders through retailers and, of course, many of our most important bank issuers and acquirers being more regional or global players. We're also seeing the tech giants and mobile companies launching services in this payment space here in Europe and the relationship between issuers, acquirers, and merchants is changing. In terms of processing, scale is a critical driver of competitive advantage and becomes even more important in Europe with the mandatory separation of scheme processing activities. If I look at it from a customer perspective, Visa Inc. commitment to continuing to develop the European market is important for our clients. Representing 26% of total combined payment volumes, Europe will be Visa's second largest region. Our clients are reassured that there will be an empowered regional office (34:35) with strong regional focus processing in Europe and potential for investment that will be attractive to European members. From a management perspective now, the focus is on completing the transaction so that we can get on with integration. The signing is an exciting and significant milestone towards reuniting the two parts of Visa but up until completion, my message to the team will be that we also need to continue to deliver our strategy and the service that our members and stakeholders value highly. Continuing to deliver puts the business in the best position to benefit from the integration of the two organizations. Finally, I strongly believe that the uniqueness of this deal lies in the fact that our two companies already work together and have done so throughout our history. We share a brand, rules, and a number of operational practices further facilitating our union and rationale to come together.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nicolas. Let me just make a comment about perspective from Visa Inc. This transaction does create a truly integrated global leader that will allow us to capitalize on strong growth opportunities in a highly attractive region. We also expect that it will create substantial value to revenue opportunities and cost efficiencies associated with the transaction from a member-owned association to a commercial entity and the opportunity to integrate the two businesses. We're also confident in our execution capabilities given our experience of transitioning to a commercial model from a member-owned model ourselves. Also remember, as Nicolas pointed out, we're merging two entities that have a close working relationship and share many common products and platforms. Let me make a few comments about our views on this financially. The transaction is financially attractive for both parties. With balanced consideration of a mix of cash, stock, and earn-out, we expect it to be accretive to our stand-alone revenue and EPS growth before transition costs beginning in fiscal year 2017, the first full year of the combination. The preferred shares offer current VE members continuing ownership stake in the company and also serves to provide liability protection to our Visa Inc. shareholders in conjunction with the new loss-sharing agreement with key UK banks. The earn-out provides additional upside potential for both parties if net revenue targets are achieved. We feel very good about the structure of the transaction since the balance consideration encourages the VE's current owners and VI to work together to enhance the long-term value of the business to the benefit of all parties. Vasant will go through this in more detail in a few minutes. I think in the interest of time, I will skip page five, which you can read on your own, which just talks about why we think it's an attractive growth opportunity; as well as page six, which is this current snapshot of the Visa European business; as well as page seven and eight, which show you the complexion of the new combined Visa. Let me move on and talk about page nine, which are our post-acquisition plans. Before I get into the details here, just want to make a comment about our ability to execute. We've done this transition before, as I pointed out, when we created Visa Inc. and have a great deal of experience, not just knowledge, of what's required. In addition, as I've already said, we also have people on both sides who have worked together for a long time and will benefit from those strong relationships. Since his arrival, Nicolas has made significant changes to VE which has resulted in an even closer working relationship between our two companies. He's also made changes to the business which are consistent with the way we would run the company going forward. He and I spent some time thinking about the integration process and our time line and approach will put clients first. In short, we know how to do this and will pace it properly. So, turning to our integration plans, I want to first recognize the shift in focus that occurs as we transition from a member-owned association to a commercial entity. The nature of our relationships with clients will evolve and we will be working hard to continue to earn their business. We think we've got a fantastic platform from which to do that with innovative and differentiated products and services, in addition to our world-class brand. We also plan to maintain a strong European presence, just as we do in our other regions. We expect to have a local empowered leadership team in Europe led by Nicolas, with the European headquarters here in London. In addition, we'll invest in the country resources needed to serve clients effectively. We intend to maintain a data center in Europe and will obviously continue to comply with European data privacy regulations. Finally, Visa Europe comprises 38 countries and we will ensure that we have country-specific strategies that are responsive to the evolving competitive and regulatory landscape. One of the strategic benefits of the transaction is that we will be able to deliver enhanced digital and mobile capabilities in Europe so this will be an important focus post-close. Our plan is to provide access to our Digital Solutions roadmap and partners. VE had already announced plans to roll out Visa Checkout and we're already working with them on that in the context of our existing partnership. We can extend to Europe all that we're doing to open our technology platform, which will enable collaboration and co-development of innovative payments experience. By combining the two companies, we do expect to get benefits of scale and efficiency, providing access to our infrastructure, products, and corporate services to VE. We will fully integrate the VI and VE systems, which we expect to take three to four years as we work carefully with our clients to do this properly. On the pricing side, we believe there is an opportunity to expand yields in Europe as we align the economic model with the value we bring and genuinely evaluate pricing from the perspective of a commercial enterprise rather than a member-owned association. However, we will be careful to remain competitively priced for our clients. It's obviously a very competitive environment and please remember that it wouldn't be intelligent for us to telegraph our specific plans, so we're not going to talk anymore about the specifics about pricing and yields. And with that, I'll hand it over to Vasant to go through some additional details about the transaction.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Charlie. On slide 10, we outline the financial impact of the acquisition on Visa. Assuming the transaction closes April 1 next year, 2016 will be a stub year with two quarters of Visa Europe in our numbers. We expect low single digit percentage point EPS dilution in fiscal year 2016 before onetime integration costs. There are three reasons for this. First, we will be issuing preferred share, which at the time of issue will on an as-converted basis amount to approximately 80 million shares of our class A shares, or 3.3% of shares outstanding. This creates almost $0.025 of EPS dilution each quarter until we buy back an equivalent amount of class A shares. We will be stepping up our stock purchases over and above our normal course buybacks to offset this dilutive impact. Our plan is to do this through open market purchases over six quarters post-closing. In other words, we expect to have bought back an amount of our class A shares equal to the preferred shares issued on an as-converted basis in addition to our normal buybacks by the end of 2017. As you may expect, the dilutive impacts of the shares issued to Visa Europe members will be greatest in the second half of 2016 and taper off through 2017. Second, we expect to issue $15 billion to $16 billion of debt with maturities from 2 years to 30 years. We're putting in place a long-term capital structure. The weighted average cost of this debt could be around 3% to 3.5% depending on market conditions. We are working with Visa Europe to prepare the required financial information which will include unaudited pro forma financial statements reflecting the combined entity under U.S. GAAP for fiscal year 2015. Market conditions permitting, we could be in the market in early December. Interest on the debt is expected to cost us $0.03 per share per quarter. This is $0.03 of dilution in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 if we have the debt in place three months before we close. Third, we're not assuming significant benefits from revenue and cost action in the second half of 2016. We will have some benefits, but they will not be material enough to offset the dilution from the stock and debt issued until 2017 and beyond. As we get to closing, we will refine our estimates and be able to give you a better sense of the impact on 2016 EPS. In fiscal year 2017, both revenue and cost benefits accruing from the acquisition will start to kick in, and the dilutive impacts of the share issuance will fade away. It is our current projection that Visa Europe will be accretive in fiscal year 2017, our first full year as a combined entity. 2017 accretion is expected to be in the low single digit percentage points range before integration costs. We will provide non-GAAP numbers that adjusts for onetime costs associated with the restructuring of Visa Europe as we integrated into Visa. We are working on purchase accounting and its associated impact on our financial statements. It is our current expectation that the bulk of the purchase price will be allocated to indefinite lived intangible assets which will not be amortized. Other than adjusting for onetime integration costs, we do not plan at this point to move to cash EPS reporting. Once again, we will provide more clarity as we get to closing. We expect the full integration to take until the end of 2020. As Charlie indicated, net revenue yields are expected to expand as we move to market-based pricing over time depending on client, competitive, and regulatory factors. On the cost front, the majority of the savings are derived from the technology integration which requires the most time. As such, technology-driven savings will be largely realized after 2017. We will have savings from organizational integration in 2017 and 2018, but we will also be making immediate investments in deploying our digital initiative and enhancing our client service model. We expect all the revenue and cost synergies from the Visa Europe transformation to be realized by 2020. In 2020, we would expect high single digit percentage point EPS accretion and Visa Europe operating margins to be comparable to Visa Inc. margins. In total, we're targeting $200 million in cost savings, or roughly 30% reduction from the current run rate. When we look at the current run rate, we exclude the royalty that Visa Europe is currently paying us. This is included in their reported expenses but, as you know, it is not a cost reduction for the combined entity. We also exclude noncash depreciation and amortization expenses. While we reduce cost where we can leverage Visa scale, we will also be adding cost as we invest to bring additional capabilities to our European clients, as well as to enhance the service we offer them at the local market level. As Charlie indicated, we will continue to operate with London as our regional hub much as we do today in Singapore, Dubai, and Miami for our other international regions. We will also retain a data center in the EU. To fully integrate Visa Europe, we will incur $450 million to $500 million in onetime cost over three years to four years. The bulk of these integration costs will be incurred to complete the technology transition. As I mentioned before, we will specifically identify these costs each quarter and update future estimates as needed until the integration is complete. We will have some onetime cash and noncash charges coincident with the closing of the transaction. Cash closing costs are estimated approximately $150 million which includes stamp duties payable in the UK plus the usual contingencies paid to bankers, lawyers, et cetera. Since the put will cease to exist at closing, we expect to reverse the put liability currently on our books a onetime noncash gain of $255 million. Also under U.S. GAAP, the royalty fee currently paid by Visa Europe is deemed to be below market. At closing, we have to establish the value we are realizing for implicitly paying Visa Europe to end this arrangement. As a result, we expect to record a $1.5 billion to $2 billion noncash write-off of the purchase price to reflect the settlement of the existing franchise agreement. Once again, we will have more precise estimates as we get to closing. Visa Europe operates as a U.S. taxpayer with a 35% tax rate. As you know, Visa's effective tax rate is currently below this. As such, our blended tax rate will increase modestly post-acquisition. As always, we will work on tax planning initiatives to reduce our tax rate over time. Moving to slide 11. As we've said for many years, we will put in place a long-term capital structure coincident with this acquisition. We intend to issue $15 billion to $16 billion in debt with maturities ranging from 2 years to 30 years. The size of each tranche will be adjusted based on market conditions. Our plan is to issue in the U.S. market in U.S. dollars for best execution. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio could rise to 1.5 times immediately post the acquisition. It is our plan to manage our long-term gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the 1.1 to 1.5 range. Based on our conversations with the rating agencies, we expect to maintain our current A+, A1 ratings at these leverage levels. Of course, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratios will be significantly lower at all times given the cash we hold for settlement as well as any offshore cash. We could have used offshore cash to fund part of this transaction but have chosen not to do it at this time. Post-closing, we expect to put in place alternative structures that will allow us to achieve the same goal in a more logical and tax efficient manner. As I indicated earlier, we will use proceeds from the debt offering to fund the upfront cash payment to Visa Europe members as well as to increase stock buybacks through 2017 to offset the preferred stock issued. The capital structure we will have in place will not only be more efficient but will also not restrict our future flexibility to invest in growing our business organically, to fund appropriate M&A, and to maintain our philosophy of returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Slide 12 provides a summary of sources and uses of cash. It's important to note that we expect to have approximately \u20ac2 billion or $2.3 billion of cash on the Visa Europe balance sheet which will transfer over to us at closing. This cash is freely available for settlement or general corporate purposes as needed. As I mentioned earlier, post-closing, we will work on restructuring some of the new entities to put in place mechanisms that will allow us to use excess cash we have offshore more efficiently. In terms of the upfront cash consideration, which is to be paid in euros, we plan to hedge a portion of our euro exposure between now and the close of this transaction. Moving to slide 13, Visa Europe members can realize a total value of up to \u20ac21.2 billion at the end of four years. Almost half this value is in the form of the earn-out and preferred shares. The earn-out provides additional upside potential to both parties if agreed net revenue targets are met cumulatively over 16 quarters post-closing. Preferred shares give Visa Europe members a continuing stake in Visa and the opportunity to benefit from the value we can create in Europe and globally. The preferred shares also provide a funding source for legal fees and litigation settlements if we have them in the future. As we do in the case of the class B shares, we will adjust conversion ratios to account for any payments made. There will be two series of preferred stock issued: one to UK and Ireland members; and the second to all other members of Visa Europe who are eligible to receive preferred stock. We will have an additional layer of coverage in the UK under a loss-sharing agreement with 11 of the largest UK members to directly fund settlements for domestic claims after certain levels of losses are paid from the UK and Ireland preferred stock. There will not be any additional indemnities in the UK for domestic claims. Outside the UK, the second layer of coverage will come from existing indemnities which will remain in place. This mechanism is designed to fund legal expenses and settlements, if any, related to interchange in the Visa Europe territory. Specifically, potential losses based on domestic and EU rates up to the value of the preferred shares are covered 100% by this mechanism as our 70% of potential losses based on inter-regional rates. In the UK, as necessary, Visa Inc. can rely on additional protection under the LSA for 91% of claims related to domestic interchange. Slide 14 describes how we expect to account for the earn-out and the preferred shares in our financial statement. The earn-out will be accounted for as contingent consideration. The fair value of the obligation will be recorded as a liability on our balance sheet at closing based on a probability rated estimate of the payout. Each quarter, we will mark this liability to market based on the revised view of the probability and size of the payout. This quarterly adjustment will be recorded as non-operating expense or income over the 16-quarter earn-out period post-closing. As a reminder, all these amounts will be noncash until the fourth anniversary post-closing. At this point, a cash payment will be made to Visa Europe members up to a maximum of \u20ac4 billion plus up to an additional \u20ac700 million of interest depending upon the cumulative net revenue performance of the business over the earn-out period. The preferred share will be recorded as equity at close based on the value of class A share equivalent at \u20ac5 billion with a small discount to reflect the restrictions around transferability of the shares. If covered litigation payments are made or legal expenses are incurred, the conversion ratio of the preferred shares is reduced with an offset to litigation or professional fee expenses. In addition, we expect to record the two noncash charges I mentioned earlier. With that, I'll turn this back to Charlie.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Vasant. In summary, we're delighted to be reuniting the Visa family. We believe we've structured this in a way that creates value to grow Visa Europe members, our shareholders, and our clients globally. Before I turn it over to Jack, first, I want to thank both the Visa Europe team and that the Visa Europe board. To Visa Europe team, congratulations on a great company you built. Thank you for all that we've done together to this point and we look forward to being your partner as one combined company. And to the Visa Europe board, thank you for the energy, patience, detailed work and the way in which you focused in a balanced way on delivering both short and long-term value to your members. We'll work hard and I'm confident this combination will deliver both short and long-term benefits to your members. And with that, Jack, we'll turn it back to you.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Charlie. Dexter, at this time, we're ready to start the Q&A session. And I would like to just ask all of the folks listening today to limit yourself to a single question so as to provide more folks the opportunity to get on the call. Dexter?\nOperator: I would now like to turn the \u2013 Okay. Our first question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMoshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Charlie, I heard you loud and clear that you don't want to talk about pricing, but one of the concerns that's been expressed is that the banks, once they kind of get their \u2013 once the check clears, would want to leave. Could you just talk about \u2013 obviously, you've got the earn-out payment and the preferred, could you talk about how you thought about that structure in terms of the long-term partnership with the current banks that make up Visa Europe?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I mean, let me start and Vasant can obviously chime in. Listen, I think, as we've \u2013 as both Vasant and I each talked about, we think the structure very much aligns the interest of us doing what makes sense for Visa Inc. as well as doing the right thing on behalf of the former members. And as I said, we live in a competitive world. We understand what goes on, but at the same time, we are going to have to transition from a member-owned structure to one which is different than that. So, again, all I can say is that we're very, very conscious of both sides of the dynamics which is, there's opportunity for us as a combined company, but we also have to do it very intelligently and very carefully in a way that our clients understand and, at this point, probably expect given all of the conversations directly that we've had with the board.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut - Evercore ISI: Thank you and congratulations. Can you give us a sense of how the $200 million in cost savings will layer in approximately between FY 2017 and FY 2020?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So, as I said in the comments, in 2017, mostly we will look at the global platform that Visa Inc. has and seek to integrate from an organizational standpoint Visa Europe into Visa Inc. There will be some adjustments in 2017, but then the bulk of the savings, as I mentioned, really come from harmonizing the two technology platforms. And what we will be doing in 2017 is really working on harmonizing the platforms. And then, as Charlie said, very carefully transitioning over to our new platform. We will run both platforms for a period of time, which is where some of these integration costs come in. Technology-related savings will kick in mostly in 2018 and beyond with the bulk of them in place by the end of 2019 and into early 2020. So, the savings pick up over time and that is factored in to the outlook we've given you. We will have accretion next year; when I say next year, I mean in fiscal year 2017. And then, we expect that we will be in the high single digit accretion range by the time we're done with all the integration.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And let me just add to that just a little bit of color around the reason why the conversion takes the amount of time that it takes. What we are not doing is just taking the existing platform we have and asking all of Visa Europe's clients to convert to that. The work that we have to do is to go through very carefully and understand what needs to get build out in the Visa Inc. systems to accommodate everything which is very specific for the European clientele. We then need to go build it and then we need to have a conversion plan in place that works on behalf of clients.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And the other thing I would just also mention, in case it wasn't entirely clear, is we will almost immediately, post the closing, make investments to bring additional capabilities to our European clients like Visa Checkout, as well as make investments to provide a level of service at a local level and enhance what we have today. So, there will be investments happening fairly quickly in the process, too.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. I guess, Vasant, I heard you say, I think, that Visa Europe and Visa Inc. margins you're assuming will be equal at some point in time. Could you just talk about whether or not there might be some deviation in that? Just figured that you might be able to extract more synergies from Visa Europe on a combined platform. Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think what you've got is a best sense of things at this point in time. Obviously, as one gets into this and we go into years two and three, we'll learn more about all the possibilities in terms of both what we can do on the cost side, what we can do on the revenue side, and so on. I think this is, at this point, I think the best point of view we can offer you. And when you adjust for the royalties that Visa Europe is paying us, when you look at the cost savings we can generate, it gives you a sense of where margins can get to from where they are. And so, we feel good that by the time we're done with the integration, Visa Europe margins should be in the Visa Inc. range.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Thank you. Kind of shift gears to the core business, Charlie. The cross-border business obviously is probably one of the highest margin areas of the company. It continues to be light, I guess, even after the quarter. Do you think we've troughed here, or is your sense that you could tick a little bit lower?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, listen, the easy answer is we really don't know. There's been continuing weakness and the early part of this quarter is slightly below where we were running. But that's a call on, as Vasant talked about in his remarks, on the strengthening, the weakening of the dollar, and broader economic impact. I just \u2013 I do want to say relative to cross-border, when you think about what we have to offer and what our competitors have to offer, cross-border payments is hugely value added. It's something that we'll experience the kind of volatility that we've see given the impact of the dollar on people's ability to spend, but it doesn't change the long-term value that we provide in cross-border, and we believe that ultimately translates to volume as these things evolve over time and also as we start to lap decreases that we've seen.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJames Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Charlie or Nicolas, could you maybe comment specifically on whether the agreement includes any terms whereby the owners of Visa Europe re-up for a certain length of time and agree to remain at a certain issuance volume level or card level with Visa Inc.?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Listen, there are agreements in place in Visa Europe that stay intact and we work commercially beyond that. Beyond that, you can look at the structure yourself and see what that provides for.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.\nDarrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Look, just on the financing side, you're bringing on roughly $15 billion to $16 billion in unsecured debt versus I think about $12 billion upfront needed and obviously you're using another $5 billion from preferred. I think you said, you mentioned in the past, you had about $5 billion plus of foreign cash and I know you mentioned you're not using it now. So just, when you think about all the cash you have there, $7-plus billion of free cash flow annually, can you just comment on the incremental buyback potential in addition to the $5 billion authorization you mentioned that we could potentially expect to see maybe even above and beyond the preferred?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, as we said earlier, we will borrow more than the cash that is paid out to Visa Europe up front. We will use that additional cash to step up our pace of buybacks. Our goal is to buy back the equivalent class A shares to offset the effect of the preferred shares issued over four to six quarters post the closing, so by the end of 2017. We will have more flexibility in the use of our offshore cash post the closing. We have a variety of plans that we expect to put in place and, as they fall into place, we'll talk to you about it. The goal will be then to have \u2013 not only have more freedom to move the offshore cash but also to move it efficiently and with minimal friction costs. I should also make sure you remember that we do keep cash available as a back-up for our daily settlement process. Some of that offshore cash today is used for that purpose so you shouldn't assume that all that is excess cash.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nJason A. Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. Wanted to get a sense of how much revenue synergy is assumed in the fiscal 2017 and the fiscal 2020 accretion projection, and just directionally, how much of that might be expected to come from improvement in the net revenue yields versus other general sources of top line synergy like cross-selling?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, as Charlie said, we don't plan to talk much about specific pricing plans for obvious reasons. But as you look through sort of some of what we've told you, clearly, when you move from an association model, you would expect there to be improvement in net revenue yields. How much, how fast, exactly how, I think we've given ourselves the ability to do it in the way that makes the most sense competitively and otherwise. And there's not a whole lot more about this that we plan to talk about publicly, but you'll see as we go along how things evolve.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos of Cowen. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the deal, guys. Wanted to start off going back to the core business, how do you guys think about the improvements in the net revenue yield given some of the puts and takes around cross-border, some large business coming up with Costco and the like, your thoughts about being able to drive that higher over the intermediate term?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, as you saw, I mean, we had some pricing last year. We'll get the benefit of that pricing in the first half of fiscal year 2016 also. Clearly, the mix of the business with growth we have happening outside the U.S. which is a higher net revenue yield business, the mix of the business improving in terms of e-commerce and so on helps yields. We'll always look for opportunities where we create value to price for that value. And over the past three or four years, you've seen some steady improvements in net revenue yields. So as Charlie said, I mean, fundamentally we like what we see in our business. The underlying trends of the business remain as good as they've ever been. We have some short-term what we consider to be transient drags on the business on a reported basis from some of the reasons I outlined. And then we have \u2013 as you see happening from time to time in this business, we have some big new wins, some big new renewals happening that have some impact in the early years and early quarters of those renewals and wins.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I would just add to that. First of all, I obviously agree completely with what Vasant said. When we talk about the specifics the way we're thinking about 2016, they are driven by some very, very discrete and very specific items that don't continue for the long term in this business as opposed to what we do believe is the strong underlying growth that you'll see especially as we get to the latter half of 2016 in the domestic business, and then ultimately in the cross-border business, and that's really what positions the core business to continue growing. But what I really do want to just \u2013 it would be remiss if I didn't point out is with commerce moving to digital platforms as we're seeing, we have more ways to involve ourselves in that commerce than ever before. And as we stood here \u2013 when this company went public and we talked about what we were going to do to attack all of the cash that was still on society, the things that we're talking about now, especially as it relates to mobile, didn't exist to the extent they do today. And so as we think about our ability to tackle and take advantage of disintermediating that cash and continue to provide value-added services alongside that, that's not in how we're thinking about 2016 or probably 2017, but that's what we come to work every day to try and drive, and why we feel so good about the long-term growth that still exists in the business.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nCraig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Yeah, hi. Thanks. Considering the strong appearance of underinvestment in the Visa Europe platform since the recession, I was hoping for an honest assessment of where you see their capability now versus Visa globally. And also if you can discuss in terms of regulatory scrutiny that this deal is likely to come under, all things considered. Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, let me take a shot at the first one and then, Vasant, you can chime in on the second. On the first one, I personally think it's like a gross overstatement to talk about whatever words, Craig, you used to describe Visa's \u2013 Visa Europe's investment since the recession. My view \u2013 again, I've only been here three years and I'll tell you in the three years that I've been here, it was, I guess, a year into that or so that Nicolas joined, we have been working extremely closely together on leveraging our platform at Visa Inc. to help Visa Europe's clients. In addition to that, and I'm speaking for him but he can certainly chime in. He's sitting right here. He's been fairly aggressive about coming in and thinking about running the company the way you would think about running a for-profit company. And if those things together result in a lower expense base, so be it. That does not mean that they're not investing in the future of the company. I actually think just the opposite in a lot of what we're seeing. Having said that, even with all that he's been able to do as a standalone business, it's a small portion of what we'll be able to deliver as a combined company, both in terms of efficiencies and additional capabilities.\nNicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.: Yeah, that's a very good answer. I don't think I have anything specific to add to that.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And on the regulatory front, obviously, we've been in touch with the various authorities. They are aware of what has been underway. We have been in touch with them even as we got to this announcement. If you look at it from a regulatory standpoint, Visa Europe as part of Visa Inc. now has access to substantially greater financial resources, which makes it a financially much stronger player. Whether \u2013 if there's any concern around settlement risk management, the resources available now are vastly bigger. If it comes to concerns about cyber security, et cetera, you now have Visa Inc. and all our capabilities available to Visa Europe on an unfettered basis. So when you look at all that, we think this makes Visa Europe far more stable and stronger from a regulatory standpoint. We have indicated, as Charlie did, that we will maintain as we have with all the other Visa businesses, a very large local presence in London, and increase our local presence in many of the other key European markets. And we will continue to have a data center in the European Union and comply with all the regulatory requirements. So we really think that this is a big plus from the standpoint of what regulators care about.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Vasant (01:13:15)\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hold on. Hey, Jack, hold on.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Yes.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me just add to that for a second.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Sure.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Just to be really specific for a second, when we look at the specific regulatory approvals required, there are three antitrust control filings which will take place. It's the European Commission, the Turkish Competition Authority, and the Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority. And when we think about what this means for competitive reasons, we're very, very confident that we will get through this process in the timeframe that we spoke about. And then what Vasant is talking about goes beyond regulatory approvals required. It goes to the fact that our combined company and the way we intend to run it is very consistent with what we believe European regulators want out of this company.\nCraig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Thank you.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan...\nCraig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Trying to (01:14:15) answer to my first question, it was the best I've ever seen it. I don't want to embarrass the guy sitting next to me so...\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan of CLSA. Your line is now open.\nTom McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC: Hi, guys. Visa Checkout seems to be a pretty significant initiative here in the United States. I was wondering if you could share with us the conversations, dialogue you're having with the European banks and their willingness to embrace that as well in the 38 countries in Europe.\nNicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.: Nicolas speaking. I think we've just started the process of talking to our customers about Visa Checkout. And they like the fact that it will be a common approach between what used to be up to now to Visa \u2013 two (01:15:02) different Visa company. And having said that, once again, we are very early in the process. So we'll see how it goes, but I see no reason why they shouldn't like it.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And let me just add just because I think this is second nature to Nicolas, but for the rest of us it's different than the environment we operate in. When decisions like that are made at Visa Europe, they are made with a great deal of effort from the Visa Europe management team. But I would describe it as deep involvement from the board, which includes some of the most significant and a fairly wide representative group of the clients that exist within Visa Europe. So it's not management on their own making a decision to do something. It's done management with the board that do, in fact, represent the existing clients.\nNicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.: And there was a lot of scrutiny from the board on this specific topic.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Excellent. Dexter, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you so much. I just want to, I guess, try and assess how the terms of the earn-out tie with the accretion targets that you set. I heard the revenue targets. How about costs and the timely execution of the synergies, the $200 million that you called out, are they stipulated anywhere? Again, I'm just trying to gauge how visible the synergies are on the cost side. Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Tien-tsin, as we disclosed, the earn-out is linked to net revenue targets. So cost is not figured into it. Net revenue, we think, as you all know, reflects significantly value created in this business. It's also relatively easy to track. And the whole purpose of the earn-out is that if this business has greater value, then both sides benefit from that value.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Tucker of Egerton Capital. Your line is open. Mr. Paul Tucker, your line is now open.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Paul, are you there? Dexter, let's move on.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote of Susquehanna (sic) [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is open.\nSmitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. It's Smitti from Morgan Stanley. Charlie, just wondering if you could share more details or give us more update on the China opportunity. Any more granular details on when you could potentially get a license? And also can you share with us some of your early thoughts in terms of how you plan to address the issuing and acquiring side over there?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, listen, as far as timing goes, there's really not anything additionally to talk about, otherwise, I certainly would've covered it. We cannot submit our application until the final regulations come out. As best we understand, they're actively being worked on within the Chinese government. But again, it's up to the Chinese government, not up to us. Within our company, you can imagine that we are not sitting around and waiting for that event. We've got a tremendous amount of work going on inside the company, people working on both an application because there are a series of models out there for industries which have been opened up to competition. So we've done a fair amount of work on being prepared for that as well as there's a fair degree of \u2013 a fair line of sight relative to what our operating environment will have to look like within China. And so we've got a team of people working on being in a position to have that in place in the timeframe that's outlined in the licensing process. And then we've got our China team working on just what you asked, which is what our strategy is to grow the acquiring side of the business, because we've got a very, very big gap between where our cards are accepted and where UnionPay's are in the physical world, as well as the big opportunity that exists in the online space. And on the issuing side, as I pointed out many times, we have fairly deep relationships with Chinese banks as evidenced by the sizable cross-border business that we have today. So our domestic plans are regular part of the conversations we have with the issuers. So that's a very long way of saying we've got active plans that we're working through but obviously, we can't do anything until we're able to submit our application and then see what the Chinese government decides from there.\nSmitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi. Thanks. Nicolas, in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned that the relationship between issuers, acquirers and networks in Europe are changing. I was wondering if you or Charlie could elaborate on that. I know it's an open-ended question but your insights would be appreciated.\nNicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.: I think one of the points that will be changing due to regulation is the relationship with the retailers and therefore with the acquirers, and that's the point I was referring to. Once again, this will come out from the new regulation that we have, as you know, in Europe, and we will see that happening during next summer. My last comment maybe would be the fact that from a competition perspective, this might open a different approach to retailers. That's what I was referring to.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the only thing I would add is those of us \u2013 those of you that have been following us for a while have heard us talk about the efforts that we have underway on the merchant side of our business. And we're very hopeful that the solutions, like what we announced with CyberSource this past quarter, will be all applicable within Europe to help build those relationships and ultimately the acquiring side of the business.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi, guys. Just to follow up on that, how do you guys believe the new European regs will impact Visa Europe? Will it be some positives and negatives and does it come out neutral? Or do you guys come out more on the positive end or negative end? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, listen, I think \u2013 I guess a couple things. Number one is, relative to the timing of the transaction for us, there's a fair amount of clarity at this point on what the environment looks like. So as we think about the way we forecasted the impact on our company as a combined entity, it takes into account what we believe the pluses and minuses are of the regulatory environment. When you look at things like the separation of scheme and processing where the final regs haven't been released but there's pretty clear direction where things are going, it's like anything else in life, there are potential pluses and potential minuses. And what we've got here is the ability to be very proactive about thinking through how we're going to make it a plus for us. I think that's as much as I want to say at this point.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Ken?\nKenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Can you hear me?\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Yes.\nKenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Sorry. Okay. Charlie, I know you're reluctant to project too much here, but you point out the experience that you've had or Visa's had in terms of converting from a bank association, and I'm wondering, should we look back to that as a \u2013 the Visa Inc. transition as being a blueprint or a playbook for how you would approach Visa Europe here? Is that helpful at all for us?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, listen, I think \u2013 listen, the short answer is on most things, no, other than what we learned as we went through that in the training that the people at Visa Inc. have had on both sides, on being on the Visa Inc. side, call it, the U.S.-based part of the business, as well as the strong contingent of non-U.S. people, we've just been through and know how to do it. When we talk about like our lack of willingness or whatever words you use to talk about specifics, I actually think (01:24:27) we're being pretty clear here. What we're not doing is we're not telling you the specifics of what we intend to do on price. And again, as I said in my prepared remarks, I hope you understand that that's the smart thing for us to do as opposed to lay out exactly what you're going to do. By the way, I can't imagine a company in any industry that would think that's a smart thing to do. So what we've done is, in lieu of that, is we've given you what we think the expense synergies are. We've laid out what we think our capital actions will be so you can get to your own point of view on what that means for our share count. And we've given you what we think will happen all in all relative to EPS accretion at different points of the transaction. So if you have all that, you should be able to do the revenue number, and behind that is what we believe we'll do overall in pricing. So again, what we're trying to do is be fair and transparent for this transaction because it is a different kind of transaction starting from a different place in a different environment, both competitively and from a regulatory perspective. So the case is built specific for this transaction but we're trying to create that balance of being as transparent as we can while not giving away anything competitively.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Dexter?\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nLisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Taking a step back from the details of the transaction, when you look out to 2020 and beyond, what effect do you think your Visa Europe acquisition as well as the regulatory changes in Europe will have on the underlying secular dynamics in Europe? Meaning adoption of card, adoption of digital, kind of mix of credit and debit. There's some sharp differences between some areas of Europe and much of the rest of the world.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Listen, there are, and I think \u2013 I guess broadly speaking, what I'd say is \u2013 and I know you all know this \u2013 but any time there is stronger competition, there's an ability to drive greater results. And so whether that means that because we are able to bring the capabilities that we have today and that we're able to continue to develop based specifically upon the European needs, that will allow us, we believe, to drive deeper penetration than Visa Europe would have been able to do on its own just because of the resource constraints that they had. As we become stronger here, our competitors will become stronger here as we've seen in other parts of the world. I know you all spend a lot of time comparing us to our competitors, we do as well because we want to learn and because we compete with them every day. But the reality is the stronger we each become, the stronger we make the other. And you see that as being evidenced in how \u2013 the swiftness that we move in the marketplace and the types of things that we are doing. And if you look at the types of things that we're doing as a company or MasterCard is doing as a company, I don't believe that those things would have been in market if we were continuing on as associations. So we do think that we will bring more competition to this market. The competitors will respond knowing that there's more competition. But our belief is there's still a tremendous amount of opportunity to electronify payments in the marketplace and we've got a greater ability to do that as a combined entity.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And the only other thing I would point out is despite all the troubles that Europe has had economically in the last five years, is you've seen from Visa Europe's reported numbers on payment volumes, there's been very healthy payment volume growth through that entire timeframe. And there still is a very large opportunity, as Charlie said, in Europe, in the 38 countries that will now be part of Visa Inc. to disintermediate cash and checks. So we're very excited about that kind of opportunity that was previously not part of \u2013 not available to Visa Inc. shareholders.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Dexter, at this point, we have one time for one final question.\nOperator: Thank you very much. And the last question is coming from Jason Deleeuw of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.\nJason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Yeah, thank you. And I want to ask a question on Chase Pay and the announcement with MCX, does that agreement change Visa's interaction with Chase or just the general payments transaction at all? And are you hearing from any other large issuers that are now more interested in an arrangement like ChaseNet?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Whatever they've announced doesn't change anything with any contractual agreement that we have with Chase. Whatever they've done with MCX is something that they've done. I would say that as we've said before, we have very active dialogue with our clients, both here in the U.S. and abroad \u2013 not here, I'm not in the U.S. right now \u2013 but in the U.S. and abroad of what the potential benefits of that structure are and whether that's something they're interested in. And to date, there has not been a lot of appetite. Whether that changes or not, we'll see. We are very, very focused on solutions that make it easier for all Visa cardholders to pay for things, anyway, whether it's a physical point of sale or in the digital space, and we will be aggressive in helping all of our clients to compete on that level playing field. Every single one of them regardless of what any one individual issuer does.\nJason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Charlie. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your patience today. We know it was a very long call and we thank you all for joining us. And on the off chance that anybody actually has more questions, Victoria and I are around all day to take them. Thank you again.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Jamie. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Visa, Inc's fiscal third quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's CEO, and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's CFO. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet, and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today's commentary was posted to our website prior to this call. Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Jack. We reported another solid quarter of financial results, with strong revenue and earnings growth against an economic backdrop that continues to be uncertain. Most of our results were in line with our expectations going into the quarter, with a few highlights and exceptions. Let me speak to those first. First, we recognized a tax benefit of $280 million. When we last talked to you in April, we had estimated that this would be a fiscal fourth quarter event, so this is essentially a change in timing. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 22% in Q3, and shifted $0.12 of EPS into the third quarter from the fourth. Based on this shift, we now expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to approximate 34%, and for the full year we are now anticipating a rate between 29% and 30%. Second, revenue growth of 12% on a nominal basis was significantly higher than we anticipated, in spite of continuing foreign exchange rate headwinds of approximately 3 points in the quarter. Revenue growth out-performance was driven by sustained high currency volatility that substantially offset the foreign exchange rate headwinds, as well as low client incentive levels than previously presumed. Third, our expectation for higher client incentive levels in the third quarter did not come to pass due to lower payment volumes and performance adjustments in specific geographies, as well as the timing and impact of certain issuer deal renewals. Some of these client incentives are shifting to the fourth quarter as these deals are signed. As a result, client incentives will be higher in the fourth quarter, both in dollars and as a percent of gross revenue. Despite this, we now expect client incentives for the full fiscal year at the low end of the 17.5% to 18.5% range. Finally, we revalued the Visa Europe put option, taking $110 million non-cash, non-operating expense. The increase in value of this liability was a result of an increase in estimated Visa Europe adjusted sustainable income. As a reminder, US GAAP requires us to estimate the put option liability each quarter. Moving on to the quarter\u2019s business drivers and our financial results. Global payments volume growth in constant dollars for the June quarter continue to be solid at 11%, in line with the March quarter. The US grew 9% and international grew 14%. In the June quarter, US credit grew 12%, flat compared to the March quarter, as the effects of the Chase conversion begin to wane.  US debit grew at 6% in the June quarter, down about 0.5 point compared to the March quarter. Gasoline prices continue to have a significant negative impact, reducing growth in aggregate US payment volumes by approximately 3 percentage points. We continue to see the largest share of these savings going to debt repayment and stronger consumer balance sheet. International payments volume growth of 14% was powered by China, the Middle East, southeastern Europe, and South Asia. The modest uptick in growth rates versus last quarter was driven by the initiation of domestic payments volume reporting by a large Chinese bank. More recently through July 21, US payments volume growth was 10%, with US credit growing 12%, and debit 8%, not materially different from Q3 trends. Global cross border volumes registered their third consecutive quarter of 8% constant dollar growth, though the international component declined 1 point to 9% compared to the March quarter. As has been the case all year, out-bound corridors of Russia, Canada and Brazil remain challenged. Brazil, in particular, was hurt both by a weak currency on issuing, and lapping the FIFA World Cup on acquiring. The strong dollar has continued to depress in-bound commerce into the US. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we're monitoring travel into South Korea due to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus, also known as MERS, and the impact on out-bound Chinese travel from the recent equity market correction. In Venezuela, currency controls have effectively shut down the cross border business for private banks. The bolivar continues to depreciate, and we have moved to local currency collection. All this will significantly reduce revenues from our Venezuelan business for the foreseeable future. On the positive front, out-bound US spending remains robust, as well as cross border trends across the rest of Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. Through July 21, cross border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 8%, with a US growth rate of 7%, and an international growth rate of 8%. Transactions processed through Visa\u2019s network totaled $18 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period, but down 3% from the March quarter. The US grew 8%, while international delivered 7% growth. As most of you know, in Russia, we transferred domestic processing to the new national processor NSPK in April. This resulted in an aggregate 2 point decline in process transaction growth in the June quarter. We expect this drag on process transaction growth to continue for the next three quarters, approaching almost 3 percentage points each quarter. Through July 21, process transaction growth was 8%, with a US growth rate of 10%, and an international growth rate of 1%. The international growth rate, of course, being impacted by Russia. Now to financial results. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.5 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase, and was driven by solid results across all revenue line items. Strong global payments volume drove service revenue to $1.6 billion, up 9% over the prior year. The quarter also benefited from previously announced pricing actions. Data processing revenue was $1.4 billion, and grew 6% over the prior year's quarter based on continued strong growth rates in Visa-processed transactions, both in the US and internationally. While on the subject of data processing revenue, let me call out a dynamic associated with the transition of Russia domestic processing to the NSPK. While we are no longer processing these domestic transactions, we continue to own the issuer-client relationships. For this reason, we will continue to recognize the associated processing revenue in our data processing revenue line. This will be offset by payments to NSPK for the actual processing, which will flow through our network and processing expense line. In short, the revenues stay the same as before, but our expenses will increase. International transaction revenue grew 21% to $1 billion as the impact from the previously announced pricing actions and higher currency volatility offset soft cross border volume growth. As expected, total operating expenses for the quarter were up 11% over the prior year. Higher personnel costs were the key driver, impacted by above normal employee incentive accruals, tied to better than expected year-to-date performance. In terms of the fiscal fourth quarter, we still expect net revenue growth to approach double digits, despite continuing foreign exchange rate head winds, and higher client incentives than we had in the third quarter. Expense growth rates will moderate from Q3 levels, with the full-year growth rate coming in as we expected in the mid single-digit range, which is a couple of points higher than current consensus. For fiscal 2015, we now expect to end with double-digit constant dollar net revenue growth, and mid-teens adjusted EPS growth. We were active in the market in the quarter, repurchasing a total of 15.5 million shares at an average price of just over $68. Fiscal year-to-date, we have purchased 44.1 million shares at a price of just under $66 per share for a total of $2.9 billion. We currently have authorization to repurchase up to $2.8 billion of stock. Finally, some early observations on fiscal 2016. As we look ahead, currency volatility could moderate from record levels, reducing the revenue contribution of cross border transaction. We will lose the benefit of recent conversions, and absorb the full-year impact of large deal renewals happening in the fourth quarter. Also, China startup costs remain unclear at this time. On the positive front, we're heartened that despite an uncertain global economic environment, payment volume growth has remained steady and healthy. We hope that as the dollar stabilizes, cross border growth rates will accelerate. And in the US, we will lap the sharp declines in gas prices. We're working through the details of these and other headwinds and tailwinds, and how they might impact us next year. As we always do, we will provide a more comprehensive point of view when talk to you again after the fiscal fourth quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf: Thank you very much, Vasant. And good afternoon to everyone, and thank you all for joining us. I guess, let me start by just reiterating how pleased we are with our quarterly results. As Vasant mentioned, revenue growth of 12% was better than we anticipated, especially given the FX impact of about negative 3 points. Adjusted net income growth was 33% as our anticipated tax benefit was accelerated to the fiscal third quarter from a previously expected fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.74, excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option, and including $0.12 from the tax benefit I just mentioned. Payments volume growth of 11% on a constant-dollar basis, the effect of a strong US dollar and lower gasoline prices continued to negatively impact growth by three points. And processed transactions and cross-border volume both grew at 8%. Overall, our results were especially pleasing given that we continue to see very little change in the overall global economy, with a few exceptions. We are hopeful, but not counting on an improvement in the US economy, but we see very little improvement with the US consumer in our numbers thus far, if any. There are positive signs in employment and housing, and the accumulated savings from lower gas prices should help, but we'll have to wait and see. Internationally, we see continued weakness in Brazil and Russia, but we see strength in southeastern Europe and parts of Asia-Pacific. I'd like for a second to just address the topic of Visa Europe for a moment. As you may have read in our earnings press release and 10-Q filing, we've updated our language regarding the put option valuation, which Vasant just covered. Separately, we announced that we're in discussions with Visa Europe about a potential business combination. I've said many times that we believe there is compelling logic for both Visa, Inc., and Visa Europe to merge, and is something we would like to pursue. So this should not be a surprise to anyone. We\u2019re targeting to resolve these discussions quickly, certainly by the end of October, and we'll provide an update during the fourth quarter earnings call, if not sooner. Given these discussions, we may be restricted from buying back our stock. There's also no assurance that any transaction will ultimately be agreed or implemented. At this time, there's really nothing more we can add, and won't comment beyond what I've said here, or disclosed in our 10-Q. Rest assured that when there is an update to be made, we'll do so in a public forum. Let me move on now and talk about our business, and let me start with our client-related activity, which I feel great about. Starting with our issuing co-brands, we renewed our co-brand credit card partnership with Southwest Airlines in the United States. Visa will continue to be the exclusive payment network for Southwest's terrific co-brand credit card. This renewal is an extension of our 15-year-long standing partnership with Southwest Airlines. It represents one of our largest and fastest-growing co-brand partnerships in the world. We renewed an important co-brand partnership with Avios, the loyalty program for British Airways and Iberia, a partnership with Visa covering the United States, Canada, Bermuda, and the Caribbean. AAA extended our longstanding 37-year credit card partnership agreement. We also renewed the credit card portfolio for Wyndham Rewards, the loyalty program for Wyndham Hotel Group, the world's largest hotel company based on number of hotels. And turning to our business internationally, we renewed our strategic credit partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in Korea, and Lotte, another top-10 issuer in Korea for debit and credit. Softbank SB, Japan's third-largest mobile carrier has partnered with Visa to launch a new pre-paid card offering to their 37 million subscribers. And Gazprombank, one of Russia's largest financial institutions, renewed a multi-year debit and credit agreement. Let me make a couple of comments about China. I don't have very much to add since we last talked about it last quarter, but I want to reiterate a couple of things. We continue to move forward with our work to enter the domestic Chinese payments market, and look forward to growing our investment within China.  Our business model, as you all know, is about partnership with banks, retailers, governments, and technology companies. We believe our ability to help them grow will help accelerate broader economic growth within China, both in the cities as well as the rural areas. And we continue to view this as a significant and important opportunity, and one which is very long term in nature. Vasant talked a little bit about Russia. Here we completed the full migration of our domestic transaction processing to the NSPK in accordance with the law. As Vasant said, Visa is now only processing cross-border transactions into and out of Russia. And our work to transform commerce and build out digital payment platforms to support our clients continues. First on Visa Checkout, we continue to gain momentum. We have over 270 financial institution partners globally. We have over 160,000 merchants who are currently live globally, with over $50 billion in total addressable volume. New merchant partners include US companies such as Under Armour, Taco Bell, Dunkin' Donuts, Williams-Sonoma, Eddie Bauer, Living Social in Canada, and Starbucks in Australia. To date we have over 5 million registered users, and we\u2019ve launched Visa Checkout in 16 markets around the world. New markets include China, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil, Colombia, the UAE, and South Africa, to name a few. We continue to see great reactions from our merchant clients, and have launched several new global marketing campaigns, including with Dunkin' Donuts, Zulily, and Fandango in the US; and Cineplex theaters and Indigo Books and Music in Canada. Second, we continue to expand the Visa token service. More than 2,300 financial institutions and banking partners are participating. In addition, Apple Pay in the US and Google globally. International expansion of our token service will begin later in the fall within our US, Canada, and Asia-Pacific regions, and allows us to begin tokenizing Visa Checkout. Third, we continue to build out our capabilities to support our merchant partners. We are partnering with Verifone in a way that enables merchants to offer their customers a more streamlined secured purchase experience across digital and face-to-face commerce environments. Verifone will connect its point-of-sale gateway to Visa's CyberSource global merchant payment management platform, providing merchants with a single platform to protect customer payment data, mitigate fraud, and integrate digital and off-line payment systems. Last, but equally important, is payment security. Obviously, this is an area which is evolving, and for us we're doing everything we can to differentiate ourselves through innovation. Given the current cyber-threat landscape, especially facing merchants, we're committed to developing solutions to help the industry better detect and respond to data breaches. We announced a partnership with FireEye to bring the first of its kind cyber-security capabilities to the payments industry, and extend our combined expertise and intelligence to acquirers, merchants, and issuers of all size. The Visa and FireEye community threat intelligence system will bring together threat information from both companies, allowing merchants and Visa clients to easily access our leading knowledge of cyber-attack data to quickly detect and respond to the attacks. These new solutions will focus on minimizing risks and vulnerabilities, and detecting and responding to breaches faster. On a final note, regarding FIFA and football, for our investors, but also our clients and all of our partners. We view the stewardship of our company, our brand, and our clients with the utmost importance, and try to hold ourselves to the highest standards. We seek to partner with those who think and act like us. I don't believe that FIFA is living up to these standards. Furthermore, their subsequent responses, in my opinion, are wholly inadequate, and continue to show lack of awareness of the seriousness of the changes which are needed. To this end, we believe two things need to happen to ensure credible reform. First, an independent third-party commission, led by one or more impartial leaders is critical to formulate reforms. Second, we believe no meaningful progress can be made under FIFA's existing leadership. Football itself is a great sport for which we are proud to be associated, and we want to be proud to be associated with FIFA, and hope and look forward to working with them to that end. To close, I just want to reiterate that we are pleased with our financial performance to date. Although we will provide full-year 2016 metrics next quarter, we feel good about our business, our performance, and our innovation initiatives, which should drive our success in the future. And as a reminder, we have nothing incremental to say about our discussions with Visa Europe. With that, Vasant and I are ready to take your questions.\nJack Carsky: Jamie, we\u2019re ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut, Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is now open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you, good afternoon. Charlie?\nCharlie Scharf: How are you?\nDavid Togut: Very good, thanks. Could you talk about your strategic options in Europe in the event that you don't consummate an agreement with Visa Europe? In particular, have you looked at possibly acquiring some of the domestic payment networks in Europe?\nCharlie Scharf: Listen, we have and I have talked about this broadly, as well. We have a terrific relationship with Visa Europe today. We have been operating in the fashion that we have been operating now since we\u2019ve gone public. We work closely together on a day in and day out basis. And they have responsibility for the business and the brand in Europe, and we do everything we can to enable them, and vice versa. And that's the relationship that we would see continuing if these conversations didn't move forward.\nDavid Togut: Thank you.\nJack Carsky: Jamie, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nChris Brendler: Hi. Thanks, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk about the strong growth in cross-border revenue this quarter, how sustainable that is, and whether or not you see additional opportunities for pricing down the road? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes we had, as you saw, good growth in cross-border. It's a few things. We talked about the geographies that are doing well, and some -- we were helped on cross-border revenue growth by two other things, as you know, pricing and also by currency volatility, so we got spread revenues that flow through that line. As we look ahead, I think if the dollar starts to moderate, a big chunk of our business is somewhat depressed right now, which is the commerce into the US, and several corridors are soft, like Brazil, which was hurt in a couple of different ways, Russia, et cetera.  So there is hope as we go into next year that with some of those things now lapping and the dollar hopefully stabilizing, that things could ramp up in terms of volume. On the other hand, volatilities may go back to more normal levels and would reduce that line. So a couple of different trends there, but all in all we feel good about it.\nChris Brendler: Excellent, fantastic results. Thank you.\nJack Carsky: Next question, Jamie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Smitti S., Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.\nSmitti Srethapramote: I know it's early days so far, but I was wondering if you could share with us qualitatively if the transactions that you're seeing taking place on Apple Pay and other mobile payment systems starting to take share away from cash transactions from consumers who use it, or is it mainly just a basic substitution of classic for mobile at the moment?\nCharlie Scharf: I honestly don't think we have enough real data yet to talk intelligently about it. All I can talk about is my own experience, which is I've been using it for both. But, I mean, when we have more acceptance, and we start to see more transactions, we'll have a much better feel and we'll make sure we share that.\nSmitti Srethapramote: That\u2019s fair enough. Thank you.\nJack Carsky: Next question, Jamie?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis. Your line is now open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, guys. Can you talk a little bit about your competitive strategy against PayPal now that they are independent, and to what degree you view them as a competitor, and what sort of specific competitive initiatives you have in place?\nCharlie Scharf: Sure. I've talked about our relationship with PayPal in the past. I'm not sure it changes vary dramatically, whether they're owned as part of a broader company or they're independent. Something like half the transactions that go through eBay wallets are on general purpose cards, of which we are roughly half, and that's important. But they also have a very big business that they then use our transactions to mine from, to disintermediate our clients' relationship with us, and the client's relationship with our clients, ultimately which are their banks. And so that's something which is -- which has to evolve, and is not something that we think is sustainable for the long term.  Our view is when we think about what we have got to do in the market place, we actually don't spend a lot of time thinking about what PayPal is doing or what we're doing any more or less than we look at all the interesting people \u2013 things that people are doing in the world of digital commerce. What we're focused on is the fact that we're lucky enough to have a platform and have a client base where we're the leader in the payments business globally. Commerce is moving to digital platforms.  Forget about all of our competitors or people who want to compete with us. We're doing everything that we can to ensure that we're going to be as successful in the world of digital commerce as we have been face to face. And so to that end, you see our solutions in the marketplace such as Visa Checkout, which I obviously covered here and I've talked about elsewhere. But it also relates to all the other mobile solutions and digital solutions that you've heard us talk about, everything from our token service to the digital enablement program, as well as even more broadly opening up APIs and access, and allowing others to access our services in a way that inserts us as the payments network into experiences that people are building. So that's what we're focused on, and it's very much focused on the opportunity that exists in the world, and not any one individual company out there.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific, thanks.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Lisa.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli, William Blair. Your line is now open.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. I know you said nothing on Visa Europe, but maybe this is something you could answer. When you did change the valuation on the put option, can you tell us what you're looking at, like what information you're looking at to change that? And then I know there was a formula out there, put call for buying it, is that \u2013 if the transaction happens, would it be under that previous contract formula?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I'll talk about how we go about the put valuation. And in general, I think we're not commenting anything on the transaction discussions themselves, but we do have to revalue the puts every quarter, and it has to be done on the basis of updated information, the most up to date information we have. And based on that, we did that again this quarter and as a result of that, we came up with a value that is reflected in our Q. And that is the formula that we\u2019ve used, I believe for the entire eight years that the put has been in place and it relates to making estimates of what a sustainable net income would be and then there is a multiple applied to that, all of which is described some detail.  So when you run through that based on the information \u2013 the best information we now have to estimate sustainable net income for Visa Europe, and you look at the multiples you have to apply, methodology being exactly the same as what we've used before, you get to the value we laid out in our 10-Q. So that's pretty much all there is to it. There really isn't anything different than we've done before.\nCharlie Scharf: The only thing that I would add to that is that and as I referenced, we spend a lot of time with Visa Europe because we're connected at the hip. And it's very clear that with their change in leadership over the last year and a half, they have moved to a more commercial model, and increased what they would view as the economic that they are providing for their clients. And that translates through to this view of sustainable income that we've been able to observe that Vasant just referenced. \nJack Carsky: Jamie, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig from Autonomous, your line is now open.\nCharlie Scharf: Craig, are you there?\nCraig Maurer: Yes, can you hear me?\nCharlie Scharf: Hi, Craig. We got you. How are you?\nCraig Maurer: Okay. I have a question on commercial card. We've been seeing weakening trends across several issuers, including AMEX and USB, and I was hoping that you could comment on what you're seeing in that segment?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, in general we had a good quarter on the commercial card. Volume growth in the US for commercial payments \u2013 volume is 10% in the June quarter. It continues to perform well. We renewed several multi-year US and Canadian clients. There's a lot of interest from non-financial institution participants who want to provide value-added services within the payments and commercial payments industry. These would be things like technology providers or health care entities and B2B programs, entertainment verticals, and so on. So all in all, we feel pretty good.\nCharlie Scharf: The only thing I would add to it is that when we look at the detail behind the numbers, you actually do see a fair amount of divergence based on the type of clients that you have. So clients that are focused on the oil industry, and it's a long list of them, you do see fairly significant weakness, which is to be expected. But on a portfolio basis, there are other types of businesses that are performing much better. So overall, we do get here in the US that 10% number, but a lot more differentiation than at least we've seen recently.\nCraig Maurer: And is virtual card starting to play a big role in commercial payments?\nCharlie Scharf: Honestly, it's still very small, but obviously something we're focused on and growing.\nCraig Maurer: Thank you.\nJack Carsky: Next question, Jamie?\nOperator: One moment. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Hey, just philosophically, I was wondering if you could rehash, Charlie, how you would think about a large M&A transaction and the criteria you would use to assess its value, and kind of go forward with the deal? Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf: Sure. What we've said consistently is first of all, we would start with \u2013 our first preference would be to grow organically. We've got facing assets and we've got amazing people here that have built great things without having to rely a lot on acquisitions. And that really \u2013 and it genuinely is our first and foremost way that we want to go about building things. Having said that, there are certainly times when it makes sense to buy things. I always like to point back to the three things that we've done so far, as the type of things that we think could continue to make sense. CyberSource was the most significant acquisition that we've done in the payment space, and we're not looking to get outside the payment space. Things that we do want to strengthen the benefits that our clients get of running transactions over our core network. And CyberSource allowed us to broaden the capabilities that we had in the online space. So just in the core of the business, but made tremendous sense for us. We then bought a company called PlaySpan, which at the core of what we from PlaySpan was technology and people. And those people and that technology is what built and powers Visa Checkout today. It wasn't for the rest of the business at PlaySpan; the rest of it was actually very small. And then the Fundamo business, which got us far more engaged and understanding, and brought us some capabilities in the mobile payment space in the emerging markets. And so, as we look at the type of transactions that we're looking at, what we've said is, there is -- Europe is the big one that could be on our radar screen because that put exists, and because of this compelling logic and beyond that we're mostly focused on smaller things that again would add to the capabilities of the existing network that we have.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Is there a specific financial criteria that you would look at?\nCharlie Scharf: No, I think every one of these deals were different. I mean, take the deal that I just described. You evaluate them differently, including what it would cost you to go build something versus acquiring it, and how much time it would take to get to market, and what that would be. I did not talk about a fourth company because it's small, but very important that we just acquired called TrialPay, which inserts us into the merchant to merchant offers business. We bought that because we thought it was important to get in the market sooner, and the time it would take to build it would be much longer than that. So, each one of these I think would have a very different rationale, and if it was a big enough transaction that we would talk about the economics, we know we would have to have compelling logic, both strategically and financially for you all.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nJack Carsky: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller, Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller: Straightforward, but just one question. I mean, it looks like -- I think we saw a shelf was filed. So, whether or not something actually happens with Visa Europe, can you just remind us again how you think about balance sheet flexibility or debt leverage possibilities? And then really, just in terms of capital structure and use of cash, I think you mentioned there could be restrictions on buybacks. Is that included in your guidance for the year? Thanks, guys.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I\u2019ll. In terms of a Visa Europe transaction -- if it happen, should it happen, when it happens -- we've always said that we would be viewing that transaction as an opportunity to do two things at one time. Clearly, it's a great transaction in terms of reuniting the Visa family, but beyond that we would also use that as the trigger to put in place a long-term capital structure. I don't think our views on that have changed much. In terms of the second question, Jack, was there another question on that one?\nDarrin Peller: It was around buybacks, and whether or not \u2013\nVasant Prabhu: Oh, on buybacks, yes. As you know, I mean, there are certain rules under which companies can and cannot buy back stock depending on the information that is either available or not, and how material it is, and all that. It is our sort of sense at this point that we might not be able to buy back stock in the quarter, but things can change.\nDarrin Peller: Is that in your guidance already?\nVasant Prabhu: In terms of our -- its impact on our guidance, if we end up not buying back stock for the entire quarter that's what happens. It will have some modest impact on this year. It will certainly have some impact on next year, depending on whether we catch up later on and so on. So, there's a fair number of variables there. It depends on how long we're not buying, and how fast we catch up all those kinds of things.\nCharlie Scharf: For one quarter it's not that significant.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah, for one quarter, as you can run the numbers yourselves, it won't be that significant. But it is certainly different than what we might have expected when we last talked to you. So, you should definitely factor that in.\nDarrin Peller: All right. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Perlin: I want to revisit a comment you made earlier about -- let's just say competitors who use your information to mine data to ultimately change behavior away from your bank partners. I'm just wondering would the operating rules that you set forth in VDEP be a means with which to preclude that practice from happening?\nCharlie Scharf: Well, in VDEP -- VDEP does address the usage of our clients' data. So, the answer to the question is absolutely and I think the reality is we sit between a series of people that participate in payment systems. It used to be just the issuers and the acquirers and the merchants. Now there are additional parties being introduced to that. And we do think it is our responsibility to all of our clients to ensure that data is being used appropriately and the way they want and that's two ways. So, whether it's issuer data that passes over our network, the issuer should be comfortable with and if it's merchant data that happens to pass over our network, the same is true there. So, VDEP is one means, but it's a broader concept that we do take very seriously.\nDan Perlin: Okay, thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: I just want to clarify, if I wasn't clear earlier, that when we talked about our full-year mid-teens, that does envision the possibility that we might not be buyers of our stock in the fourth quarter.\nJack Carsky: Jamie, next question?\nOperator: Our next questions comes from Jason from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. Just a clarification and a question. Clarification is just on the revenue guidance for the year. Is there any minor tweak up here at all, because I know you're still saying kind of low-double digits, but I think you had been saying the low end of low-double digits previously? I'm not sure if I heard that same language on today's call. Or is the only change in the revenue outlook just the extra half point of currency headwind?\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah, we were sort of rounding down to 2% last quarter. We're rounding up to 2.5%. So, the currency effect is -- has been growing through the year. I think the only thing we would say is the third quarter came in clearly better than we expected, because currency volatilities were higher. The incentive piece moved some into the fourth quarter. So, I think, as we said earlier, incentive levels both in dollar and rate terms, percent terms, will be higher in the fourth quarter. So, we said last time that we would expect revenue to approach double-digits in the fourth quarter, and that is still our best estimate for the fourth quarter.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. And then just a clarification is on the incentive adjustments in certain geographies that I think you mentioned is one of the reasons why the incentive line came in lower than expected. What exactly was that? Did some issuers have to pay back some incentives to Visa?\nVasant Prabhu: No, it's a couple of situations that varies depending on the geography. Volumes don't come in as expected, so they don't earn the incentives that we or they might have expected, so it hits you both on the gross revenue line and the net revenue line and on the incentive line. And then in a particular few situations, there are unique things in contracts that are resolved within the quarter. \nCharlie Scharf: It's also just flat-out timing of when things get signed. Remember, when we -- that's a little bit of -- I like to talk about this internally. Just we have to do budgets and we give you guidance, but we really don't know as we look out in the future what the timing of our clients are going to be, and how different negotiations will actually take place. So, when we come to an agreement with a client, it then needs to be documented. The processes and the timing is usually driven by them. Very often they need to go through their own approvals and it's very, very easy for these things to slip by weeks or even a month, if not more, depending on how far out we're looking and so, that's just a very natural thing that happens, which is hard for us to predict and hard for us to control.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah, in this quarter we had a few of those -- a few international banks that moved into the fourth quarter, and will get done in the fourth quarter and that's the timing issue.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Vasant, I just wanted to ask -- can you help us quantify the impact price changes had on the quarter, and maybe what percentage of the price changes have showed up in the third, and do we expect the full impact in the fourth?\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah, as I told you last time, there will be some modest additional impact in the fourth quarter. One of the price changes and that was coming in with a little bit of a lag, so there will be a modest -- it's a small uptick in price impact. But yeah, I don't think we specifically quantified the price impact in total, but it hits two lines, the service revenue line and the international line. And it's those two prices increases we took -- just to remind everybody, it's the increase in the US acquirer service fee on all credit products, which went up by two basis points, and the international service assessment fee, which increased 40 bps for transactions in US dollars and 80 bps for transactions not in US dollars. And there will be a little more impact in the fourth quarter than there was in the third.\nBryan Keane: Okay, helpful. Just one quick one. Will the intangibles associated if there is an acquisition of Visa Europe will be amortized or will it be long-lived?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, that is getting very far ahead of things right now. If there is a transaction, if and when, and once the details are clear, we can talk about all that.\nBryan Keane: All right, super. Thanks, guys.\nJack Carsky: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Glenn Greene, I\u2019m sorry, from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Greene: Thank you. Just wanted to go back to the incentives conversation. Obviously it was lower than I think most of us thought in the quarter, and it sounded like it was timing. Does some of that timing kind of bleed into next year and I don't know, Vasant, if you're trying to call out that incentives as a percentage of gross revenue increase going into FY16? Just to clarify, did you have incentives meaningful for Costco, or does that kind of happen when the volumes come on?\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah, I think it's too early to give you any particular point of view on 2016. We'll do that when we talk to you in October and we'll also talk about Costco and its impact on 2016 and so on. As it stands today, the incentives -- the deals we were thinking we would get done this year are still looks -- still look like they're going to get done this year. So, we'll probably see the full-year impact of them next year, but it doesn't seem like any of them are moving into next year at this point.\nCharlie Scharf: The only thing I would add is just on Costco for a second is Costco -- the impact to us of Costco is next year for us fiscally. So, that\u2019s -- whether it's incentives, whether it's volume, revenue associated with it, that's when you'll see the impact of Costco. And then the other thing I would add is, because we've -- those of you that have been covering us for a long time know this, we do view our incentives going up as a good thing. Incentives go up when we're driving more business through the system and so, that wouldn't be a surprise to us.\nGlenn Greene: Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification.\nJack Carsky: Next question, Jamie?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin from Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thank you. I wonder, is there any type of sensitivity to think about relative to the FX volatility, in terms of a certain band of volatility, how it impacts the revenue because obviously, you've seen a nice pick-up and not to get '16 specific, but just any band in terms of how it impacts that revenue?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I mean there's two dimensions here. And in this quarter, you probably saw both dimensions at play. One, I believe there's publicly available information on currency volatilities and different metrics you can look at, so at least you can get a relative sense of how currency volatility is doing versus last year or prior quarter, or on a multi-year basis and so on, and it's been high. The other thing that also had an impact on this quarter was the year-over-year comparison. This was a quarter, where not only were volatilities high in this quarter this year, but they were unusually low or lower than they've been recently in the third quarter of last year. So we sort of benefited from both things, when you look at a year-over-year comparison. But you can look at external data to track some of this.\nJack Carsky: Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from Ken Bruce of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nKen Bruce: Thank you. Good evening. My question relates to the co-brand partnerships and just general issuing partnerships. It's really is independent of any one. But I guess if you could step back and look at there's been a lot of discussion about the increasing competitiveness on some of these deals. I'm hoping you might be willing to share some observations from your position at the table as to how the balance of power, if you will, is shifting -- if there's any clear direction of who's kind of capturing more of the economics, or just how things have evolved over the last couple of years?\nCharlie Scharf: Sure. Listen, I think it's a -- co-brands are certainly a very competitive part of the business, especially here in the United States. We've been lucky enough to have a significant number of the large and successful ones. And so when you're the big incumbent and they come up for renewal, they're always on your mind, and you're very tuned to what's going on in the competitive environment. But just as we talk about on the issuer side, people ask about well, is the issuer side getting more competitive in terms of the way networks think about it? And I think the reality is since we've gone public, there's been an extraordinary amount of competition between us and our competitors on these deals. And you see that competition embedded in the numbers that we've all been printing for years now. So the answer is yes, you see it in the co-brand space. But I also think that the co-brand business and the issuing side of the business, there has been more concentration that has developed. The other thing, which I think is becoming quite important now, is with the evolving nature of payments and things that are going on, whether it's issuers or co-brands, I think what we wind up seeing is that our clients are making very significant strategic decisions at this point relative to who they want their payments partner to be. They're not talking about this as a commodity. They're not talking about just network services is something you need to look at in terms of just what the price is. They're sitting there saying payments is an important part of my business, whether I'm a co-brand partner, because these are my most important clients; or on the issuing side, where they say payments is core to what I do. I need someone that's going to help me navigate and be successful in this brave new world of digital commerce and evolving payments that we live in, and I need to pick the very best partner to do that. We're thrilled with the success that we've had -- not just with Costco, but Southwest as you've seen, is a terrific partner, and other conversations that we have ongoing. So the answer is yes, financially they are competitive. Again, we've seen that. That's to be expected. But there are two parts to the conversation.\nJack Carsky: Next question, Jamie?\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJames Schneider: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Charlie, I was wondering if you could give us any more color on China in terms of -- and understanding that it's still early days and you have limited visibility -- but do you have any sense in terms of the restrictions you might be subject to when you do eventually enter that market? And if not, can you give us any kind of road map for when you expect to see greater clarity on those rules?\nCharlie Scharf: So on the first piece the answer is no. What has been published is helpful relative to what we need to do in order to do the work to apply for licenses to start establishing the functions that have to reside in China. So those have been very, very helpful. Relative to how regulations evolve, and what the actual business would look like in China, that's a ways off. We do not have a tremendous amount of clarity on that yet. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question?\nJames Schneider: The timing for when you get more clarity?\nCharlie Scharf: I don't know. No one knows. We live here in the United States and so we know our own system quite well, and we never know what timing looks like in this country. Listen, but listen, I think they -- the Chinese government has been -- the state council issued its decision. They've come out with some more information, which is certainly helpful. At this point, we've got -- we have plenty of information to do the work that we need to do to be in a position to apply for a license and to do the work. And honestly, that's what we're focused on. I mean, there's a lot of work for us to do, both to make the application, but also be in a position to be able to operate, if we're lucky enough to be issued one of those licenses. And that's what we're focused on. As I've said, when we talk about this being a long-term opportunity, it's for some of these reasons you point out. We don't know exactly what the regulatory climate will ultimately be. We don't know exactly the role we will play until we actually get there. But we do believe that there is great value for all the participants in the market place for us to be helpful. So we feel very good about what we can do in the country, and what it means for us in the long-term. But again, it will likely be long term and not short term.\nJack Carsky: Next question, Jamie?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Great, thanks. Good quarter here. I want to ask on the delta from your reported 12% revenue growth and the 6% to 7% you expected. Can you break it down for us by component what each driver was, in terms of how big it was? I heard FX volatility, lower incentives. Did pricing stick maybe better than expected -- things like that?\nVasant Prabhu: No, I would say you got them. Volatility is, normally going into a quarter we don't assume that volatilities will stay at sort of the high levels they were last quarter because we assume things may settle down a bit, which they actually might in the fourth quarter, given things are settling down in Greece, and settling down in China and places like that. So it was the spread revenues from volatility. It was somewhat lower incentives. It was offset by exchange rates. So you got all the factors. The pricing didn't have an impact relative to what our expectations were. It was as we expected. So, I think you've said it.\nTien-tsin Huang: Okay. [indiscernible] the FX volatility and how big that was? Also separately on OpEx, were there any one timers that drove up the OpEx, or was that really just personnel? Thanks for taking the questions.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes on the OpEx, as we said, I mean, the year is progressing better than we might have expected, and so we made some adjustments as we normally do this time of the year in accruals for incentive compensation, that would probably be the single-biggest item that shows up in the expense growth. Other than that, the only thing I said in my comments was that we had exchange rate impacts of up to three points. And fortunately, the currency volatilities here are levels that offset a significant portion of that.\nTien-tsin Huang: Offset. Okay, both of that. Got it. Thanks so much.\nCharlie Scharf: Jamie, at this point we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question will be coming from David from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.\nDavid Hochstim: Thanks. I have a two-part question. Is there any update on the EU's efforts to regulate in-bound cross-border fees?\nCharlie Scharf: There's no update. Par two?\nDavid Hochstim: Yes. If you could just expand on what you said about US credit payments volume growth, and how much of the deceleration was Chase-conversion related, and what you're seeing in the way of discretionary spending relative to last quarter?\nVasant Prabhu: Really no change whatsoever in terms of what we are seeing. There's a big impact on debit from the gas pricing, because I think three to one people use debit cards rather than credit cards. And yes the Chase conversion will continue to moderate, and will mostly be gone, I think, after the next quarter or so. That will mean that our credit payment volumes will reflect whatever the gas impact is. And the gas impact will also begin to moderate as we lap it. But in terms of how people are deploying their savings from gas, there really hasn't been any change. I think Charlie referred to that in his comments. So the US consumer remains okay, not great.\nJack Carsky: Well, thank you all very much for joining us today. If anybody has any follow-up, feel free to call Investor Relations. Thanks, again.\nCharlie Scharf: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Shania. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Visa Inc' s fiscal second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the internet and is accessible on the investor relations section of our website, at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today's commentary was posted to our website prior to this call. Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on forms 10-K and Q which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC, are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release. And with that I will now turn the call over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Jack. In keeping with prior practice let me begin my remarks by highlighting some key call-outs from the quarter. First, we reported a solid quarter of financial results despite a backdrop of continued domestic and international economic cross currents. Importantly, revenue growth of 8% was a couple of percentage points better than we had expected and telegraphed last quarter. The up side was driven by lower incentive levels than previously assumed and a higher currency volatility benefit. Our flat EPS growth for the period year over year was a direct result of the favorable tax impact we enjoyed in the second quarter of FY '14. Second, the overall strengthening of the dollar continued to exert pressure on revenue growth. Exchange rate headwinds this quarter reduced reported revenue growth by approximately two and a half percentage points. We expect dollar strengthening and its associated impacts, to continue for the balance of the year. Third, for the second consecutive quarter, our client incentive rate came in below expectations. This was once again due to the timing of certain contractual obligations, as well as moderately lower payouts associated with lower payment volumes in several challenged geographies like Russia and Brazil. We expect line incentives to be higher in the second half of the year. Fourth, our effective tax rate was 32% in the second quarter, 10 points higher than Q2 last year, when we recorded an IRS section 199 tax benefit related to multiple years. Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter this year, as I will discuss later. Overall, the underlying drivers of our business remain stable and healthy, as evidenced by payment volumes and transactions growth. However, the strong dollar impacts us negatively this year not only on currency translation, but also in our cross-border business. Despite these headwinds, we're maintaining our outlook for the year in line with guidance previously provided. There are, however, some significant shifts from quarter to quarter which we want to make sure are clear to you all. First, on the revenue front, after a better than expected second quarter, we now project the third quarter to represent the low point of growth for the year at 6% to 7% on a nominal basis. Growth will pick up again and approach double digits in Q4. The third quarter is expected to be negatively impacted by higher client incentives, some are shifting from the second quarter, the continuing drag from lower gasoline prices and tougher comparisons in the other revenue line which benefited last year from revenues associated with our FIFA World Cup sponsorship. The full benefit of price increases and the smaller incentive drag due in part to the lapping of a deal intensive quarter in FY '14 will help Q4 revenue growth. Second on the expense front, we expect a meaningful step-up in expense growth in the third quarter, as a number of programs including marketing and certain technology initiatives have been phased to the back half of the year. As always, we will continue to carefully monitor the economic backdrop and can and will make expense adjustments as necessary. Our full year expense growth expectations remain unchanged at this time. Third, we expect a higher tax rate in the third quarter, followed by a substantially lower tax rate in the fourth quarter. Our estimated tax rate in the third quarter is expected to be as much as 200 basis points higher than the rate in the second quarter. However, as currently anticipated, we expect to take advantage of certain tax benefits as early as the fiscal fourth quarter which would drive an effective tax rate in the low 20%'s in Q4 and no change to our full year fiscal tax rate expectation of the low 30%'s. When you put this all together, we're now looking at third quarter fully diluted EPS being $0.06 to $0.08 lower than analyst's current expectations. For the year, we now expect our fully diluted earnings per share growth to be at the low end of the mid-teens range, in line with current analyst expectations. Moving on to second quarter business drivers and our financial results, I will start with global payments volume and process transaction trends. Global payments volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 11%, unchanged from the prior quarter. The U.S. grew 9% and international grew 13%, both at similar levels to the December ending quarter. Drilling down further, in the March quarter, U.S. credit grew 12%, a two percentage point moderation compared to the December quarter. The account conversion is complete and consistent with last quarter, contributed approximately 3 percentage points to our overall credit growth in the period. This positive impact will continue for the next two quarters, though at a declining rate before lapping. Lower gasoline prices, the full effect of which hit payments volumes this quarter reduced credit volume growth by two points. As such, gasoline prices appear to be the primary driver of the step-down in credit growth. U.S. debit grew at 6% in the March quarter, generally in line with the December quarter. Lower gasoline prices had an outsized effect on debit growth, reducing it by approximately three percentage points. In aggregate, lower gasoline prices impacted U.S. payments volumes by a negative three points in the quarter. A portion of the savings from gasoline price declines is being spent in other categories, primarily grocery and restaurant segments. This is evident in debit payment volumes, not yet in credit payment volumes. More recently, through April 28th, U.S. payments volume growth was 9%, with U.S. credit growing 12% and debit 6%, essentially unchanged from Q2 trends. Global cross-border volume delivered an 8% constant volume growth rate in the March quarter, unchanged from the December quarter. The U.S. grew 6% and international grew 10% in constant dollars. The further strengthening of the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year continues to have a negative impact on cross-border commerce. Forward currency curves imply that the dollar will gain in strength. If this materializes, these cross-border trends are likely to persist and perhaps worsen. Through April 28th, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 9%, with a U.S. growth rate of 6% and an international growth rate of 10% generally in line with the second quarter rate. As you can see, when you adjust for the dollar, the underlying drivers of our business have remained very stable in aggregate. However, the significant currency moves we've experienced this year are impacting cross-border commerce in a variety of ways, with the largest impacts coming from the U.S. dollar. Overall, cross-border volume growth has remained suppressed from historical levels. As may be expected, outbound cross-border commerce from weakening currencies like the Euro, Ruble and the Canadian dollar has been slowing. Hardest hit corridors were Russian card holder spending across Europe and the Middle East and Canadian and EU card holder spending in the U.S. Offsetting this to some extent is accelerating cross-border commerce of the strong currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar. In Q2 we saw U.S. card holder spend stepping up in Europe and Latin America. Chinese travel across the world continues to be robust. And cross-border spend out of Latin America is also picking up, helped by easier year to year comparisons. Currency shifts will remain a critical variable to watch as the year progresses. Any moderation of dollar strength will help our business and vice versa. Any pickup in economies like Europe, Brazil and Russia would be welcome. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 17 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 11% increase over the prior year period which was a one point improvement from Q1. The U.S. grew 9%, while international delivered 14% growth. Transaction growth in the U.S. is helped by some spending shift from gas to lower ticket categories of spend like QSR's. Through April 28th process transaction growth was 10%, with a U.S. growth rate of 8% and an international growth rate of 14%. Transactions grew 14% in the period, as our reboot of the business continues to pay off. CyberSource will celebrate its five-year anniversary as a part of Visa this year and we have completed the integration of this business into our global merchant services and solutions functional area. With the integration complete and since CyberSource transactions do not represent a material component of Visa's business, we will no longer call out this data separately after this quarter. Turning now to our Q2 reported financials, net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.4 billion, an 8% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by solid growth globally across all revenue categories and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by approximately two and a half points by the strong U.S. dollar. Solid global payments growth volume drove service revenue up $1.6 billion, up 8% over the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, underlying payments volume growth in local currencies remains very healthy. Data processing revenue at $1.3 billion was 9% over prior year's quarter, based on continued strong growth rates in Visa processed transactions, both in the U.S. and internationally. As mentioned, transaction growth in the U.S. was helped by some gasoline related savings being spent on lower ticket size transactions, such as QSR's. International transaction revenue was up 11% to $964 million, with higher currency volatility countering impacts from moderating cross-border payment volumes and currency translation. As we measure our key currencies, volatility was at five-year highs in Q2, meaningfully contributing to international revenues. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 1% from the prior year, with moderate higher personnel, depreciation and G&A costs, offset by lower marketing and network and processing expenses. Higher personnel costs are primarily the result of higher headcount, reflective of our strategy to invest for future growth. The uptick in G&A was primarily the result of a loss related to our debit processing business in Asia which we sold during the period. Higher depreciation was a result of ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Offsetting these were lower marking expenses, due to the absence of the winter Olympics and FIFA World Cup spend in the prior year, as well as shifts in current programs to the second half of the fiscal year. As mentioned earlier, this will result in a step-up in expense growth for the balance of the fiscal year. Our operating margin was 67% for the second quarter, in line with our annual guidance of mid-60s. Capital expenditures were $98 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, adjusting for our recent stock split, we had 2.45 billion shares of class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 2.46 billion. On a split adjusted basis, we repurchased a total of 16.2 million shares during the March quarter, at an average price per share of just under $65 per share. Fiscal year to date, we have repurchased 28.6 million shares at a price of just under $65 per share, for a total of $1.9 billion. We currently have authorization to buy up to $3.8 billion of stock. Since the IPO, Visa has add clear capital allocation strategy of investing cash to grow our business organically and through acquisitions as job number one, then returning excess cash to shareholders through stock buy-backs and dividends. Our dividend policy remains unchanged and our Board recently declared a $0.12 quarterly dividend per split-adjusted share. For the past seven years, Visa has had a consistent approach to stock buybacks with the pace being modulated to some extent from quarter to quarter by valuation considerations. This approach to buybacks will continue, as evidenced by our purchases year to date. This is a growth business that generates significant cash flow and a low base of stock. A systematic buyback using excess cash after capital investments and dividends is a strategy we have been and will remain committed to. In summary, the underlying drivers of our business remain robust. The strong dollar and other large currency moves have created some headwinds this year, as have the sharp decline in gas prices. These are the normal fluctuations one expects in the course of business. The very attractive long term secular growth trends in our business remain intact. Despite the headwinds this year, our results are on track so far and we're comfortable reaffirming the guidance we provided to you at the start of our FY '15. To conclude, this is my first earnings call as CFO of Visa. I'm delighted to be part of Charlie's team. I look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming days and weeks and with that, I will turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf: Thank you very much, Vasant. An official public welcome from all of us. First of all, let me start with commenting that we're very pleased with the quarterly results. We think of them as solid and consistent and certainly gratifying in the face of some of the more challenging economic conditions and geopolitical concerns that we see around the world. Net revenue grew 9% nominally. FX impact hurt growth by two and a half points. Operating income growth of 11%, payments volume increased 11% on a constant dollar basis and cross-border volume growing at 8% on constant dollar basis, are all very solid numbers. We see very little change in the overall global economy, with some exceptions and we see more short-term risk than we see up side. Consumer spend in the U.S. specifically continues at reasonable levels but is not accelerating. Gasoline prices continue to negatively impact both credit and debit. Outside the U.S., we see continued weakness in Russia and Brazil, but we do see strength in China and our Middle East and North Africa region. And the effect of the strong U.S. dollar, as Vasant pointed out, is meaningful. We see this through the FX translation impact, but additionally, the benefit of that we see of U.S. spenders outside of the U.S. is outweighed by the negative impact on the non-U.S. spenders spending less in the United States. Away from the economic growth environment, we continue to feel terrific about our activities to drive growth which I will talk more about. We continue to make excellent progress on our evolving technology initiatives which include everything we're doing in the digital space, mobile specifically, Visa Checkout and the work we're doing in our global merchant services and solutions groups. We continue to have a strong flow of significant client wins and renewals. I will speak a little more on several of these points in a moment, but in sum, while we remain appropriately cautious in the short-term, we remain quite bullish on the medium to long term and continue to believe there are tremendous opportunities for years to come. Let me just amplify some of the comments that Vasant made regarding payment volume for a second. First, the negative impact of gasoline on our U.S. payment volume is significant, at three percentage points. Though the initial impact on payment volumes was felt in our first quarter, the full impact did not hit until the second quarter and so the revenue impact will not be fully felt until our third quarter, because of the quarter lag on service revenues. In an update to our March quarter, Visa Insight Survey, things haven't changed much with consumers. About 30% tell us they're spending more in other categories, up from 25% last quarter. The two categories that continue to stand out are the lower ticket categories, groceries and quick service restaurants. As I said last quarter, the lag time between lower prices and spending we think is about six to nine months, as consumers accumulate enough to feel comfortable making larger purchases. Keep in mind, consumer confidence and confidence in sustained lower gas prices will impact their willingness to spend. Cross-border volume remains steady at 8% in the quarter, as we said. And as I have mentioned and Vasant mentioned, the effect of the strong U.S. dollar against certain global currencies is negatively influencing cross-border spend and ultimately revenue growth. The U.S. cardholders are spending more outside the U.S. as a result of the stronger dollar, resulting in higher transaction and payment volume growth on a constant dollar basis at international merchants. However, given currency translations and generally lower acquiring fees in foreign countries, that volume is not as lucrative as what we would have enjoyed on an inbound basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has hurt in-bound spend to the U.S., primarily from the Canadian, European, Brazilian and Japanese corridors. As Vasant mentioned, higher currency volatility has offset some of this. Let me just turn now and talk about some important client activity. Starting with the U.S., we renewed a multi-year credit issue agreement with U.S. Bank, a great partner and one of our leading issuers and the fifth largest commercial bank in the United States. U.S. bank has been a long time Visa partner and we lack further to building further upon the exciting things we've done with them, in terms of innovation, new product development and security. In the U.S. co-brand space, Best Buy, the world's largest retailer, will convert their consumer credit card portfolio to Visa later this summer. We also renewed a multi-year credit agreement with BP. BP has been a longtime Visa partner and launched its first co-brand in 2006. We're thrilled with our new agreement with Costco. We're very pleased to have been selected to replace American Express as the credit card network for its U.S. warehouse clubs and gasoline locations, beginning April 2016. A strategic benefit for all Visa issuers and their cardholders. We're also excited to be partnering with Citi on the new Costco Visa co-brand credit card. We view Costco as truly unique opportunity and very strategic. As I said, it is good for Visa, but an even bigger benefit for all of our clients. They're one of the largest and best retailers in the world. The third largest merchant in the U.S. according to the national retail federation, someone who historically did not accept our credit product and we now have an opportunity to gain acceptance where MasterCard and American Express are not accepted in the credit space. We also love that this is a truly long term acceptant [Technical Difficulty] and co-brand partnership. For all of our clients and their consumer and business clients, it will be the first time in 16 years they gain access to the tens and tens of billions of dollars of annual credit payments volume that heretofore went to American Express. It is a great opportunity to drive incremental usage. It should help all Visa issuers drive their cards towards the top of the wallet and increase new account and card holder acquisition opportunities. This was a very competitive process and there has been much discussion of what drove the outcome here. I don't want to speak for Costco, but let me say that I have not met a retailer that cares more for their clients, their members more. Going forward, Costco will be entrusting their clients, their members, these precious relationships to Visa. If it were me, money wouldn't win the day. The best brand with the best capabilities would win. I've consistently said price matters, but cannot win the strategic relationship. So our strategy is not to be the low-cost provider. As I think about what drove the decision here, I look at a series of things, including a view that we're the premier brand for Costco members, the belief that our brand will help Costco grow more than all the others, clear, strong brand preference among their members and target market, specifically with the higher growth affluent and millennial holders which in this case will drive membership and sales growth directly for Costco. Our broad global acceptance, our superior data and analytics capabilities and our leadership on innovation. I would also point out that we feel that all the benefits I've outlined, plus what our issuers bring to the table, can create more value than others. Specifically and quite simply, we, our issuing partner and the co-brand can make more and provide greater value to our clients than smaller, closed loop networks. As a remainder, the implementation of these agreements is subject to the purchase of the existing co-brand credit portfolio by Citi. Turning to our business outside the U.S., let me first start with China. Before I turn to market opening which I know is a topic that you all want to hear about, I want to talk for a second about our existing business. It is doing extremely well. We have a significant and fast growing business, with relationships that have been growing and deepening. We're the market share leader versus non-Chinese providers and that share has been steady since 2013. We continue to sign contracts and be awarded new issuant business from Chinese Banks. As examples, this quarter we renewed and expanded our agreement with China Civic Bank, one of the largest partners in China. The program will now include issuance of Visa only branded companion cards, in addition to the dual branded program in place. China Everbright Bank, one of China's largest financial institutions renewed their credit agreement with Vise. Regarding the market opening news, clearly this is a significant and positive step. The facts as we've read them thus far are consistent with our expectations and we're very excited to see more specifics which obviously will be important. We do intend to apply for a license. As I've said, we have a strong business today with great local relationships which have only become stronger over the past several years. We're excited to participate in one of the most important markets in the world. And for Visa to help in the growth of domestic Chinese marketplace, working with Chinese companies and the Chinese government. To be clear, we're not pursuing this for the short-term profit opportunity. This is a long term commitment which will pay off over the long term. We intend to prove our value as a partner within China, so bringing our value added capabilities to help grow the Chinese economy will come before our revenue and profit growth for quite some time. Regardless of when we start to participate domestically in China, we do not expect this to be a meaningful contributor to our financial results for many years to come. Turning away from China, First-Ran Bank, a large issue in South Africa and our largest issuer in sub-Saharan Africa, extended their contract with Visa. We also renewed our partnership with Desjardins, the leading financial group in Canada and the fourth largest cooperative financial group in the world and lastly Banorte, one of Mexico's oldest and largest national institutions, renewed their credit agreement with Visa. On the other side of the equation, Citibank and Itau will be moving their business away from Visa. In certain regions around the world, we have contacts with Citi which will continue to run for quite some time. In terms of how quickly these conversions commence and ultimately how long it takes has not been made clear to us and we will let you know as we learn more. While losing any business is disappointing to us, we know that we're not going to win everything, as we operate in a very competitive environment. We've always been very thoughtful and strategic about choosing for which clients we want to be aggressive in this competitive process and we feel great about our portfolio of client relationships. Importantly to us, we remain disciplined in our approach to negotiations and the net of these recent wins and losses leaves Visa and our partners in a better strategic position for the long term than would have otherwise been the case. A couple of other quick updates on the regulatory and legal fronts. First of all, in Russia, we have been actively working with the national payment card system and central bank to achieve full migration of Russian domestic Visa transactions with minimal disruptions. All domestic Visa transactions will continue to be processed in accordance with the national payment system law. And in the U.S., on the merchant litigation case, we continue to make good progress in settling the opt-out cases. Fiscal year to date, we've paid out $321 million and additional settlements are progressing nicely. And we continue to lead the world to the world of digital commerce. Visa Checkout continues to make great strides. We now have 260 financial institution partners and 140 merchants live globally. To date we have over 4 million registered users, over $46 billion in total addressable volume accepts Visa Checkout and we continue to add merchants, including small and medium size retailers, where our acquiring partners are helping us grow acceptance. We're also deploying Visa Checkout outside of the U.S.. As an example, we launched Visa checkout in China at the end of March, China Merchant Bank is the first institution in China to introduce Visa checkout to its customers. In the coming months, we're working with other Chinese institutions to deploy checkout. In April, we kicked off consumer marketing campaigns in both Australia and Canada, in partnership with some of the biggest merchants in those regions. We're on track to be live in a total of 16 markets this year. ComScore conducted a study last month to evaluate our progress with merchants since launching Visa Checkout last July. The findings are very clear. Visa Checkout customers convert to buyers 69% of the time. This is 66% higher than conversion rates reported with traditional on-line checkout. The product is doing exactly what we said it would do, solving the on-line friction problem at a rate that's higher than the competitive solutions we surveyed. In the digital solutions space, a few comments. In my time here at Visa, it is amazing the amount of companies that are working and talking about the future of payments in the role, some very young, some very established. Regardless of tenure, it's clear to me that they fall to two categories. Those that talk about being innovative and those that are actually driving innovation in way that truly drives incremental value and can scale. I'm proud of the work of the Visa team and proud to be leading the industry into this digital world. When we launched tokenization, we told you it was more than a set of just security standards. We said it was a platform to enable new commerce experiences, then came Apple Pay. When we participated in the Apple Pay launch, we said it was just the beginning and there would be more solutions that leverage our digital platforms. Since then, Samsung has announced the new Galaxy S6 payments experience and Google's Android operating system supporting host card emulation. And we have several clients developing new HCE based applications in our sandbox as we speak. As the industry leader, a Visa partnership gives the chance for these experiences to be successful because of our technology, our scale and our leadership. Our innovation is not something every consumer sees, but it is the things that we do as a platform that others can build upon and it is our platform that becomes embedded in all sorts of devices, operating systems and mobile apps. Essentially we're enabling our partners to take advantage of one common payment platform and set of standards, but still able to customize their solutions to their specific client needs appropriate to their markets, with their preferred user experiences. Great companies come to Visa first because they know we understand the technology of payments better than anyone else and we understand the needs of their users. And we continue to build out our capabilities to support our merchant partners. We completed our acquisition of TrialPay this quarter. It is a platform that we've worked with before and one that proved its value proposition before we decided to acquire the company. Combined with our broader merchant capabilities across Visa Analytics, Loyalty Products and VisaNet capabilities, this is a platform that we intend to use to help merchants improve their marketing and thereby drive their incremental sales. During the last six months, we introduced to the market three new products and solutions specifically designed to help our merchant partners. First, we created a customer intelligence dashboard, a custom analytic dashboard for merchants to enable them to understand who is shopping with them at the store level. We're helping merchants not only understand the sales trends, but also who is shopping, their demographics, where they live, where else they shop, et cetera. The platform is helping our gasoline merchants better predict demand, airlines to optimize routes and load factors and many others to optimize marketing campaigns. The second solution is a digital marketing measurement product. Earlier this year, we launched a new platform which enables our merchant clients to measure their digital market spend with an entirely new level of accuracy. When a merchant runs a digital campaign, we're able to show them in real time how many of those impressions led to specific sales using a Visa card. For many years merchants have taken a big leap of faith that clicks led to real sales. For the first time ever, we're now helping them measure the actual sales. The final example is a pilot program but one that we're excited about. Platform that actually drives new customers into our client's store. The platform is powered by Trial Pay, where we place targeted merchant offers on the web and on mobile apps. For example, you're checking into a flight, you will see an offer to get 500 miles if you shop at Pete's coffee in the next week. When the customer comes in to buy their coffee, they're notified in real time that they've received their bonus. Miles, in this case. Also we track the purchases and show the merchant in real time how many of the customers are coming into which specific stores. Early days, but client interest remains very strong. As you can see, these are products which we believe over a period of time changes our dialogue with merchants as we help them grow their business. So just to wrap up, we're very pleased with our performance for the first half of the fiscal year, especially in light of some of the challenging aspects of the economic environment. It continues to be a very exciting time in payments, as you can tell from all the recent announcements. We remain bullish on our future and we continue to broaden and deepen our work relationships with issuers, acquirers, merchants, governments and other third parties. With that, Vasant and I will be pleased to take your questions.\nJack Carsky: Okay, Shania, we're ready for the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Just trying to square a little more of the discussion on EPS growth being at the low end of the mid-teens guidance range, given your unchanged revenue growth guidance. Was it primarily tax rate assumptions in the second half of the year? And then just to further add to that, are you incorporating further volatility benefits, FX volatility benefits in your outlook and guidance? Because it clearly helped your cross-border revenue growth this quarter. Thanks, guys.\nVasant Prabhu: Darrin, just a couple of things. I think the two things you should take away from what we said was there's a certain amount of moving around going on between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. We said that the revenue growth in the third quarter will be the low point of the year in terms of growth and then it will pick up in the fourth quarter, approaching double digits. So that's one thing. The second is expense growth will step up a bit in the third quarter. Still in the mid-single digits level for the full year, but step up in the third quarter as some expense is shifting between the first half and the second half in marketing and technology. And then if you look at our personnel expenses, you should be looking more at what the first quarter level was and a little bit of growth with some of the initiatives we have underway. And the last piece that shifts things, mostly between the third and the fourth quarter, was the tax rate. The main take away from all this is, as we said, $0.06 to $0.08 shift out of the third quarter. For the full year all we're saying is we still feel good about the range we provided, but we're at the lower end of the range. Really in line with where the street is right now. Your other component of the question was currency volatility. We did tell you that it was at five-year highs in the second quarter. So in terms of what we're expecting going forward, as you know, we benefit when there's volatility because FX spreads widen. It does offset a little bit the translation impact of currencies. We're not assuming they stay at five-year highs. We're assuming that there's some amount of regression to the mean, but we're not assuming they go to the kinds of lows we saw last year. So it's anybody's guess really. So we're just assuming that it's not going to stay at this level, but nor is it going to be as calm as it was last year.\nOperator: Next question is Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Could you talk a little bit about how you will be trying to protect the volume from Costco, together with Citi, from American Express trying to win it back? And maybe just as a corollary, talk a little bit about your thoughts about what's going to happen when existing co-brands come up for renewal and the competitive environment, there?\nCharlie Scharf: Let me take the second one first. Co-brands are in the market certainly all the time. It's been a competitive marketplace. And all the things that I talked about in terms of the advantages that we think we brought to Costco, we think we can provide to almost all co-brand partners out there. In this case, it's certainly helpful to be the incumbent and the leader in the space. We've got deep relationships with the largest co-brand providers, certainly here in the United States and others across the world. And those relationships, where we believe if you treat the partner properly, you prove to them over a period of time you help them grow, there's got to be a reason for them to want to do something else, other than be with you. And so we feel very good about our positioning there. On the Costco front, I think when you take a look at what we bring to equation, you can assume that Costco, who's got the most to lose in this, has thought an awful lot about what risks they have and what opportunities they have. And the reason for them to want to go and take the risk of moving the portfolio is because they think there's more upside doing business with us and Citi in this case. And when we think about and they think about the brand preference that their customers have, as I said in my remarks, the things that specifically the affluent and millennials think about our brand versus the competing brands out there, we're very confident that we'll be able to do a better job for Costco than the incumbent. And that will start day one, as we work extremely closely with Citi and Costco and that work has begun already.\nOperator: Next is Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.\nJason Kupferberg: So can you just confirm whether or not some of your planned pricing actions for April got implemented as expected? And then can you also just clarify related to Costco, do the incentives there hit in FY '15 or in FY '16, when the contract actually begins?\nCharlie Scharf: So Costco will be 2016.\nVasant Prabhu: And the pricing is in. Just to clarify, the pricing -- there were two changes, both of which happened in April. The first was U.S. acquirer service fees on all credit products and the second was U.S. acquirer international service assessments. They went in roughly around the same time, but the impacts are somewhat different. One of them hits a little earlier in terms of impacts on our financials, the other a little later. So we get the full benefit of the pricing in the fourth quarter. We get a little less of a benefit in the third quarter. It's really a small difference.\nOperator: Yes, Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I guess I have a follow-up question to the Costco. Charlie, you mentioned it's been competitive in co-brand, but is it from an economic standpoint incrementally more competitive and does that then play out further as you renew some of the other co-brands down the line? I guess secondly, how confident are you that Citi will be able to secure the portfolio from American Express? Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf: So when you say is it economically more competitive--\nSanjay Sakhrani: Is it getting progressively more competitive, meaning are the economics materially different than they were before?\nCharlie Scharf: First let's talk Costco for a second, then we'll talk more broadly about co-brands. And I tried to make this point clearly. So, let me just make sure that I'm even clearer on it. We view Costco as something extremely unique. And so this is an industry where it's amazing, the gossip. And I don't know whether it's the consultants or what it is, but everyone likes to go around and talk about everything that's happening in terms of pricing and who did what to whom on this. What I would tell you is what we and my guess is issuers were willing to do for Costco is very specific to a unique opportunity to gain the kind of credit acceptance that we've talked about and the kind of co-brand that we've talked about, for a partner now that didn't accept our products in the past of this size. We view it as a unique opportunity to capture that volume and then to use the ability to have that acceptance to grow our products elsewhere, regardless of whether they're co-brand or not co-brand, but obviously the co-brand here will bring with it extraordinary benefits. So Costco to us stands on its own, in terms of the way we think economically about what we should be willing to do. In terms of whether the co-brand space is getting more competitive economically, I'm not sure. It's very, very competitive, as is the issuing business. And I think when people lose relationships like this, they need to figure out where they're going to look and so we assume that they'll continue to be competitive. As we think about our future and we think about our ability to continue to deliver the kind of growth that I think you are all expecting from us, we factor that into our assumptions along the way.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And just the Citi portfolio? AMEX's sales to Citi of the existing portfolio.\nCharlie Scharf: Everything that we hear suggests confidence, but we're not a party to it.\nOperator: Next is Bill Carcache of Nomura.\nBill Carcache: Apologies for another Costco question, but was wondering if you could speak to whether any of your issuing bank partners have expressed any sort of concern about the interchange rate at which the Costco volume will be coming over? Just in the sense that it could be difficult for them to offer rewards on the Costco spend. Just curious if you think that could be an issue?\nCharlie Scharf: Well, I guess I would start with, there were a lot of -- there were more issuers than Citi who wanted to win the co-brand. And so whoever certainly was involved in the process understands the competitive dynamic and what would exist. And again, I think from our perspective, the conversation is exactly what I've said here. It's a unique and strategic opportunity to get access to an extraordinary amount of volume that we and our clients weren't going to have access to and if you think about if we didn't win, the kind of conversation that we were going to have and the kind of conversation we would have to have with our issuers and their clients about not being able to participate in the opening of one of potentially the biggest retailers in the world, is not a conversation that we would have relished. So we feel very good about what we've done here. When we make decisions that affect our clients, we take them extraordinarily seriously and understand that they will look at those decisions in the context with everything else that we do for them and we feel good about what where we've come out and are confident that it's a benefit for them.\nOperator: Next Craig Maurer of Autonomous.\nCraig Maurer: Question on Brazil, the Itau loss, from what we understand that will be fairly material as a percentage of that business. And with ELO creeping into the market as well, are you concerned at all about Visa's historic market share in Brazil shrinking significantly? And following up on your comment on a Mexican win, do you have any greater visibility on when that market will open for Visa processing? Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf: Let me do the first one and then, Jack, you need to remind me about the second question. So in Brazil, listen, losses are losses. You know, I would just make it clear that these types of decisions aren't generally decisions that people make without talking to a series of people. So we were certainly involved in a series of conversations. And again, everyone makes their decisions in terms of what they're willing to do and at what price they're willing to do it at. And when a large issuer says that they're going to move volume away from you, it's going to be hard for us to make that volume up elsewhere. And that's a decision that we chose to make to some extent relative to how aggressive we were willing to be relative to pricing. Because we, as I said in my remarks, it's important for us not just to win volume, not just willing to win incremental revenue, but do it in a way which is smart for us and for the payments industry for the long term. And ELO is -- it is a fact. It is what it is. It's a different kind of network with different kind of capabilities targeted, for the most part, at different types of consumers than we generally target our business. And I'll tell you that I feel great about the relationships that we have with the other large issuers in Brazil and think we have the opportunity to continue taking share from them, albeit that share won't we place what we'll lose from Itau.\nJack Carsky: Mexico processing.\nCharlie Scharf: Yes, Mexico. There is no timetable. We're actively working on some things, there, where we think that we can prove to the issuers that by us processing, it actually becomes a benefit for them and there's nothing imminent there, but it will evolve over time.\nOperator: Next is Dan Perlin of RBC.\nDan Perlin: My question is basically this, the step-up in expense growth occurring at the same time that your inventive fees are kind of suggesting that they're also stepping up -- I guess it's two things. One is, kind of alludes to the fact that you obviously see something on the horizon, maybe it's second half of this year or early into next and I would like to get some color on that? Why you had pulled the trigger on both at the same time? Secondly, why the incentive fee slip? Why did the client take so long to convert? What were those conversations like and why are they not taking place?\nCharlie Scharf: Let me do the first one first. The first, they are unrelated. There's nothing that we see on the horizon or anything like that. As we said, incentives -- I've been here two-and-a-half years and it seems to me that we talk about this every single quarter which is we do our best to provide insight and we certainly do it for our own planning as to what incentives are going to be, quarter by quarter. But we don't have a lot of control over it. It's hard to know exactly when negotiations will become finalized, contracts will close and it changes the level of incentives. So as we've talked about multiple times, it is the full year that we really think about as something that we feel much better about than quarter to quarter. And on the one hand, we'd love to have things close sooner. It's not something we try and delay, but it happens in the normal course of business. And on the marketing side, there it just relates to some specific things that we're going to be doing in the second half of the year that really relate to the summertime, coming out of the summer into pre-school and then eventually leading into the holiday season. That relates to how we want to time our marketing spend.\nVasant Prabhu: I just want to highlight that we're not changing anything in terms of our full year expectations on expense growth. So there's really no change. So it's not like we pulled the trigger to do something different in the third or fourth quarter. As Charlie said, there are some marketing programs, particularly as it relates to Visa Checkout, that we think we can get a lot of traction doing in the back-to-school period. That's money that has been coordinated with merchants and things like that, that this is the best time to spend it. There are some regional marketing programs that are happening in the second half. There's some technology initiatives that are ramping up that may have been a little slower to start than we might have expected earlier, but are ramping up into the year, but it was all expect. And then in terms of the personnel expenses, there's a reasonable predictability in that, it fluctuates from quarter to quarter, sometimes there's some noise, small items here and there. But if you look at our first quarter run rate and you assume there's a certain amount of growth with some of the initiatives we have, all in all, I guess the short answer is -- we're not doing anything specific to ramp up the expense growth and our full year expectation does not change. And as we said in our remarks, if the world changes, we're ready to take a hard look at what remains to be spent and decide whether it needs to be spent.\nOperator: It's James Friedman of Susquehanna.\nJames Friedman: I wanted to ask about commercial. Charlie, any perspective about how you are doing on the commercial side? One of your competitors had called out some weakness on the commercial side, at least in North America in the calendar first quarter. Do you think that you're taking share and how are you competing in the commercial market?\nVasant Prabhu: Setting aside the share question, commercial payments growth for us in the second quarter was quite healthy at 10%; it's performing well. A lot of interest from non-financial institutions, participants to provide value added services. So there's a lot of non-traditional people coming in, like technology providers, healthcare entities and so on. I don't know if Charlie --\nCharlie Scharf: The only thing, commercial -- we all talk about commercial, across all of the different people that participate in this business, as one of the great opportunities. I mean, the two really meaningful opportunities that the industry has that are really meaningful, apart from just the business as we know it, is P2P and commercial. There are large, large sums of money that -- on the commercial space, specifically, we compete in. We've worked really hard on our products, we're doing fine in it. I really don't know about share. It's hard to know about it. But I think the 10% growth has the opportunity to be much, much larger. And that's something that we're working through and hopefully in the coming quarters, we'll have more to talk about specifically about what we're doing there. But it's an important business for us today. And the question is whether or not we can crack a nut and incrementally move it from the something which is incremental to which is more of a step function.\nOperator: Next is Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.\nJim Schneider: Charlie, relative to the China opportunity, I realize that there's a lot of unwritten rules at this point and there's a lot of things still in the air, but can you maybe talk about your operational readiness from a network perspective to enter China and what you need to get to a level of full functionality, there and kind of the game plan on that front?\nCharlie Scharf: Yes. Again, I would say, the devil is going to be in the details in terms of the way the rules are written. I would say it's been our expectation -- well, let me back up. What I said in the remarks is that there was -- what has been said has been what we've expected. And so you should assume that we've been planning for that and working towards that. There are different time periods that are laid out in terms of what the state counsel announced, relative to when things would have to be ready and we have teams of people around the company that are working to be prepared to enter as soon as we possibly can.\nOperator: David Hochstim of Buckingham.\nDavid Hochstim: I wonder, could you just go back to the international transaction revenue growth and help us understand how much of the change really was attributable to -- what the change is attributable to the increase in FX volatility? Because the gap might be even bigger next quarter and do you have a currency adjusted growth rate that would help us get back to that? And I guess also there's mix differences because of changes in cross-border spending?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I think you should look at -- there are three things going on in that international transactions line. One is, of course, all those transactions are in various currencies, so there is clearly an FX translation impact which is largely negative. The second is the things we talked about which is that strong currency markets have outbound commerce that's improving, but the purchasing power of the currency is greater. So that you don't get the full volume benefit even though transactions are growing and then in weak currency markets you've got inbound -- you've got declining outbound commerce and a weaker currency. The net effect of all this is also negative. Offsetting that, certainly we've benefited from volatility. I don't think we really ever publicly quantified those kinds of benefits. They move around. But clearly there's no question that some of the negative impact of the currency translation has been offset by the widening of the spread. And the two are uncorrelated. You could see the currencies moving the other direction but the volatilities don't have to go along with them. But we'll keep you posted. As I said in the comments or in the question earlier, we're not assuming that volatilities remain at these highs. We're assuming some moderation in volatilities in the second half of the year. We're also not assuming that currency markets will go back to being sort of as calm as they were around this time last year.\nDavid Hochstim: Right. So if they stayed close to these levels, we could see higher revenue than you have built in?\nCharlie Scharf: It depends on what else it affects.\nVasant Prabhu: Exactly, there are other things. As I said, three things going on in that line. Higher volatilities will help us on that particular dimension. On the other hand, a move in currencies which affect the translation line and so on. There are many things going on in that line.\nOperator: Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Just wanted to hopefully get some way to quantify the Citi and Itau losses and is it offset by some of the gains that you've had? Just trying to think about future modeling purposes. And then secondly, on tokenization, my understanding is we'll probably suspend charging for any fees even beyond FY '16? Just hoping to get an update on that.\nCharlie Scharf: So we don't talk specifically about the volumes of Citi and Itau. As I said in my remarks, not clear to us what the migration looks like. So it is hard to be very, very specific other than things like Costco and the other positive developments that we have make us feel very good about how those things all fit together. Tokenization, what's the question?\nJack Carsky: Are we going to continue to charge in 2016? Will we charge.\nCharlie Scharf: So we have the rate card out there. We've waived it through 2016 and we're continuing to look at exactly what we think the right way -- I would say what the right long term way for people to think about tokenization is, but to me, the important thing is, no one should expect that to be a monetary driver for us.\nOperator: We have Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.\nTien-tsin Huang: Just wanted to ask on Europe, with legislation getting closer to being finalized. Does that change the probability of the put in any way? What's the latest there Charlie? And then just on Costco, real quick. Just the exclusive merchant acceptance, how critical is that for Costco, I guess, Visa? I know that's driving a lot of the uniqueness to it. Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf: On the first one, listen, I don't think it changes the probabilities at all from our perspective, because we're not inside their board rooms to understand exactly what they're saying and what their drivers are. It's a consistent question that people ask us, in terms of what the probabilities are and we really don't know because they need the 80% vote. Until they get the 80%, then it's not going to happen. So really don't know, really don't understand what the dynamics are and again, what really matters is how the blocking group of people feel about it. So those that don't want to vote for it. That's something that we're not privy to because we're not in those boardroom discussions. But again, to circle back, we work really closely with Visa Europe. Example, whole group of people here today, Nicola, the CEO, is here today, as we're working through all the things that we're doing together to do a great job for our global clients, enable them to be as competitive as they can be versus the competition in Europe. And then the credit acceptance versus MasterCard and American Express, hugely relevant. That's why when you talk about the uniqueness of it, it just doesn't exist for a merchant this size that never accepted our product and now all of a sudden doesn't accept our other major competitors here in the United States. As we think about what that means for all of our clients and for our cardholders, that's certainly factored into our thinking and I'm sure the issuer is thinking in terms of the importance and what it could mean certainly for our brand.\nJack Carsky: And with that we would like to thank everybody for joining us today. If anybody has any other questions, feel free to give Investor Relations a call.\nCharlie Scharf: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And now to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal first quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s CEO; and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our Web site prior to this call. Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC\u2019s Web site and the Investor Relations section of ours. For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today\u2019s press release. This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our Web site. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.\nByron Pollitt: Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, as you can see from the earnings press release, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a four-for-one stock split, each Class A stockholder of record. At the close of business on February 13, 2015 will receive three additional shares for every share held on the Record Date. In the form of a 100% stock dividend and trading will began on a split adjusted basis on March 19, 2015. Due to the structure of the various classes, holders of Class B and C shares will not receive a stock dividend. Instead, the conversion rate for the Class B and C shares will be adjusted after the stock split, so that the Class B and C stockholders will retain the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split. Second callout involves FX. Since our last earnings call, the U.S dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our key currencies. Based on the December 31, forward exchange rate, we project an incremental 50 basis points negative impact on our full-year revenue growth. Third call out relates to cross-border activity. Cross-border volumes softened 2 percentage points in the September quarter -- in the December quarter to 8% growth in constant dollars and a further 1 percentage point to 7% through the 21st of January. Once again, FX is an important contributor as a stronger event anticipated U.S dollar has led to substantially reduce travel into the U.S from Europe, Canada, and Latin America, notably Brazil. Beyond FX, the severe economic challenges in Russia have also been a notable drag on cross-border results. In total, our outlook for cross-border volume driven revenue growth in fiscal 2015 is approximately a half percentage point less than when we began the year. Partially offsetting these headwinds has been a strong rebound in currency volatility versus product quarters. The improvement has sustained from September through early January and has stepped up even further due to recent Central Bank actions by the Swiss and the Canadians and was further aided by the recent elections in Greece. Given the unpredictability of volatility, we will continue to be appropriately conservative in our outlook on how sustainable this is for the balance of the fiscal year. For full-year revenue growth, we\u2019re maintaining our guidance of low double-digit constant dollar growth with a negative two percentage points of foreign exchange impact, but would position expectations at the lower end of that range. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect this quarter to be impacted the most by FX as well as by lower gas prices. And to therefore deliver a growth rate lower than originally anticipated, but still in the mid single-digit range. From there we expect net revenue growth rates to building Q3 reaching double-digits in Q4. We are reaffirming client incentives in a range of 17.5% to 18.5% of gross revenue. While Q1 came in at 17.4%, we expect Q2 to Q4 to run at somewhat higher levels given the pacing of deal activity for the balance of the year. We are also reaffirming our full-year EPS guidance of mid teens. That said, remember, when projecting Q2 results, in Q2 of last year Visa booked a sizable tax benefit which included both one-time and ongoing tax impacts. And we will be lapping an unusually low level of client incentives in the prior year. Lastly, we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of 3.1 million shares during the December quarter at an average price per share of $259 and change. Through January 27th, we purchased an additional 2.5 million shares for a total of 5.6 million shares fiscal year-to-date at an average price of $258 leaving us with an open to buy of 4.2 million -- 4.2 billion. Of note, all share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2014 have now been completed. Now let's turn to the numbers. I'll cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the first fiscal quarter followed by our results through January 21. I\u2019ll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter. Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%. The U.S grew 10% and international grew 13%, both at similar levels to the September ending quarter. Drilling down further, in the December quarter U.S credit grew 14%, a 1 percentage point improvement compared to Q4. During the quarter, we experienced account conversions and deconversions, the net effect of which positively impacted credit payment volume by a little more than 2 percentage points by the end of Q1, the vast majority of account conversions will have taken place. Turning to U.S debit, it grew at 7% in the December quarter, flat to the September quarter. More recently through January 21st, U.S payment volume growth was 9% while U.S credit grew 12% and debit grew 6%. In terms of fuel, significantly lower gas prices had a negative 1 percentage point effect on U.S payment volume growth in the quarter with a disproportionate impact in December and with a bigger impact on debit than credit. Global cross-border volume delivered an 8% constant dollar growth rate in the December quarter, down from the 10% rate in the September quarter. The U.S grew 4% and international grew 9% in constant dollars. Through January 21 cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% with a U.S growth rate of 6% and an international growth rate of 7%, further decelerating from the December levels. The under performing travel corridors referenced earlier, in combination with weaker growth in Brazil, Russia, and Ukraine were the primary culprits. Travel within Asia remains strong. Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled 17.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, a 10% increase over the prior year period. The U.S grew 9% while international delivered 14% growth. Through January 21, processed transaction growth was 10% with a U.S growth rate of 9% and an international growth rate of 13%. Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.4 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year driven primarily by solid growth globally across all revenue categories. And as mentioned earlier, was negatively impacted by approximately two points of foreign currency headwinds. Moving to the individual revenue line items, Services revenue was $1.5 billion, up 8% over the prior year and was driven by solid global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.4 billion, up 9% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa transactions both in the U.S and internationally. International transaction revenue was up 9% to $970 million as increased currency volatility countered negative impacts from FX. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 6% from the prior year primarily related to higher personnel, marketing and other expenses which support our growth strategies and product initiatives. Operating margin was 66% for the first quarter in line with our annual guidance of mid 60s. Our effective tax rate was 30.6% within our guidance range of low 30s. Capital expenditures were $104 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 616 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 619 million. Finally, for completeness our full-year guidance metrics for revenue growth, client incentive, operating margin, tax rate, EPS growth and free cash flow remain unchanged. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharles W. Scharf: Thank you very much, Byron, and good afternoon, everyone. First of all, I\u2019m just going to start by telling you, I think that we as a management team are quite pleased with our results. We continue to produce strong and consistent results in the global economic environment which is providing more headwinds than tailwinds. Consumers spend continues at reasonable levels, but it is not accelerating and we expect gas prices to continue to be a near-term headwind. Geopolitical tensions are playing a more meaningful role in our results as they\u2019ve at different times during our past. Having said that, our growth is still strong and well in excess of consumer spending growth as the movement from cash to electronic payments continues regardless of economic and geopolitical events. As most of you probably know, we\u2019ve put forth a proposal in this year\u2019s proxy to amend our corporate charter that would position us to effect a stock split at an appropriate time and at the discretion of our Board of Directors. As you can see from the announcement today the proposal did indeed pass and our Board of Directors declared a four-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. This action in addition to our dividend increase and our previously announced share purchase -- repurchase program are all indicators of our confidence in our future. Our long-term outlook continues to be bright as our investments in digital payments provide growing opportunities for us. Let me make a couple of comments now about our first quarter financial results. As Byron said, it was another strong quarter driven by solid underlying payment volumes in processed transactions globally. As expected, operating revenue grew 7% nominally or 9% on a constant currency basis, while expenses increased 6% and earnings per share registered a healthy 15% growth. Global payment volume grew 11% flat to last quarter and still robust. Solid rates in the U.S of 10% were bolstered by international at 13%, again no change from the previous quarter and still robust in spite of everything that is transpiring across the globe. U.S growth moderated slightly in the month of January driven by further declines in gas prices. And as Byron mentioned, our U.S results benefited from conversions as we converted significantly more accounts on to a platform than were converted away from us. Let me just cover a few topical items now. First, a few words about the U.S holiday spending season. The holiday season spending patterns evolved differently than prior years. Growth was stronger going into Thanksgiving than we\u2019ve seen in the past and it tailed off through the month of December, but a significant driver was the continuing decrease in gasoline prices. Having said that, our rate of growth was higher this year than last year including the decrease in gas prices. We also look at the rate of growth year-over-year excluding conversions and gas prices to gauge the underlying economic environment and it looks to be about flat. On that topic, I want to talk a little bit more about gas for a second. First, to put the drop into context, U.S fuel prices are down approximately 30% since June. This drop amounts to approximately $60 per month for the average consumer. According to our surveys, approximately 50% of the savings consumers are seeing is being saved, 25% is being used to pay down debt and approximately 25% is being spent in other discretionary categories. These categories include grocery, clothing, and restaurants. This is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in our own spend data. As we look forward, we\u2019d anticipate the savings will accumulate and ultimately we\u2019d see more spent in the discretionary categories including higher ticket items such as home improvement, electronics, and travel and entertainment. Third cross-border volume moderated to 8% from 10% in the prior quarter. We see the effect of geopolitical tensions here and the strong dollar and the corridors affected are not surprising as Byron pointed out. Fourth, the rebound in currency volatility is material. It\u2019s obviously welcomed and not surprising given what's going on in the world. The moderation in cross-border continued into the current quarter, as has increased currency volatility. On the expense front, we continue to manage expenses judiciously and while we continue to appropriately invest in all of our long-term initiatives, there are defensive measures we can and will take if needed in the face of any slowing economic scenario. We're not doing this yet, but we remain prepared. Let me turn my attention now just to say a couple of words about our competitive position. We love our competitive position in the marketplace. We are the industry leader, but this alone doesn't give us comfort. We know that we are the target for others, traditional and non-traditional. Thus far, we\u2019re comforted by the fact that we continue to maintain our share in an intelligent way for our shareholders. We are laser focused on investing to drive cash to electronic payments, partnering with those who will drive commerce in the digital world and creating platforms to embed ourselves in that digital commerce, Visa Checkout, Visa Token Services, Visa Digital Solutions and enabling Apple Pay. These are things that we\u2019ve done so far and there is much more to come. Let me turn now and make a couple of comments and updates regarding the legal and regulatory front. On the domestic front, we're certainly pleased with the recent outcome of the supreme Courts decision not to hear the National Association of Convenient Stores\u2019 appeal against the Federal Reserve Board. The decision is an important step in bringing clarity to the debit interchange landscape. We are hopeful this will encourage all parties to work more closely to address areas of mutual interest. Speaking more broadly to the merchant litigation, we made considerable progress in settling the MDL opt out cases. Through the end of the first quarter and to date in January, we paid out approximately $335 million to opt out merchants. We are optimistic that we will continue to see good progress. Additionally, we had approximately 1,100 requests from smaller retailers to opt back into the class. They will be compensated accordingly under the terms of the Class Agreement. In Russia, we continue to work with the Central Bank of Russia and the Russian National Payment Card System to transition our domestic processing to their network. We continue to estimate that 2015 full-year impact to be $50 million. A quick update on Visa Checkout. As I mentioned last quarter, Visa Checkout saw excellent initial traction in the early fall, which is accelerated during our first fiscal quarter, capped off by the holiday shopping season. This was driven by strong media campaign in conjunction with our NFL sponsorship as well as individual merchant media collaboration. Thus far we have conducted 24 co-marketing campaigns with some great merchant partners. Visa Checkout now has over 240 financial institution partners across the United States, Canada and Australia, which account for almost 50% of our global e-commerce volume. Several issuers are also participating in marketing programs, including e-mail and online campaigns. To date we have over 3 million registered users and consumers can now use Visa Checkout to stop at over 110 e-commerce retailers representing over 42 billion in addressable volume. We continue to see good success with Apple Pay, and with all involved parties actively promoting the service either independently or in concert with each other. As Apple reported yesterday, about 750 banks and credit unions have signed on to bring their customers Apple Pay. To date 43 of our issuing partners have enrolled in our tokenization services. These issuers collectively represent 75% of our aggregate U.S payment volume and over 500 of our clients have signed the Apple Pay contract and we are actively working with them to enable the service. As importantly the token technology employed here sets the standard for other digital experiences and you will see others come to market over the course of the next year. As we gauge the success, I agree with Apple\u2019s assessment that its early days of the excitement we see is encouraging. It will take some time to build out the NFC acceptance infrastructure for Apple Pay and others. That is happening now and will continue as merchants upgrade their terminals to accept chip enabled cards. I would also note that few if any chip enabled terminals are shipped that don\u2019t also contain NFC functionality. More specifically on EMV chip cards, we continue to work closely with all industry players and are very optimistic that the adoption of chip cards will continue to accelerate over 2015. Based on the Payment Security Task Force protection -- projections, we expect to see well over a half a billion chip cards enabled in consumer\u2019s hands by the end of 2015 and roughly half of all terminals of surveyed acquirers will be activated by year-end. We expect that by the end of 2017, roughly 70% of all cards in all terminals will be chip enabled. Moving on to the emerging and evolving technologies like host card emulation. In the fall, we launched our sandbox environment for Visa Digital Solutions. We have several clients and partners that have been actively developing new mobile and digital services in our sandbox. Next week our Visa Digital Solutions platform will launch and be live in production. We expect that several of our clients and partners will launch the new services over the coming months. Lastly, we are putting the finishing touches on several other initiatives that we will be announcing during the upcoming Mobile World Congress meeting in early March, so stay tuned. Just to close, we are very pleased with the start to our fiscal year. As we indicated last quarter, while we expect volumes to remain relatively strong, we are expecting revenues to be softer in the first half of the year including the second quarter, which we expect to be the trough. The back half of the year should improve as gas prices stabilize and the effect of our previously announced pricing changes become effective. It will continue to be a very exciting time in the payments arena and I fully believe that Visa will continue to be in a leadership position not only in terms of growing our payment volumes and processed transactions, but as importantly driving new technologies and ways to pay as we work in concert with our issuers, acquirers, merchants, and other parties. With that, Byron and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nDarrin Peller: Nice job on the quarter. Just want to touch first on what you were mentioning around FX volatility levels. As I think, Byron, you mentioned earlier they clearly have increased. Just to be clear, not including that in your outlook at least you're including -- are you including the levels that we have seen recently? And just kind of going forward with that or are you including lower levels? And maybe can you give us the size and sort of magnitude of what kind of impact it could mean if you were to sort of extrapolate off the card levels of volatility for the rest of the year on your cross-border volume?\nByron Pollitt: So we\u2019ve included our forward projection of FX rates based on the December 31 forwards. So the numbers that we quoted, the guidance that we have reaffirmed, fully reflect the most current thinking and data we\u2019ve using the forward exchange rates of December 31. With regards to volatility, which is another aspect of FX, the projection assumes some continuation of what we\u2019ve seen, but we\u2019re -- as indicated in my remarks, cautious here with regards to the balance of the year and that this is an area that it is very difficult to forecast. So clearly a good start to the year with regards to volatility it is trending, it has performed above the 10 year medium which we referred to, I believe on our last earnings call. But this is an area that goes up and down, so it\u2019s unlike FX and its impacts on our translations which we\u2019ve projected using the December forwards throughout the year with volatility we\u2019re forecasting a bit closer in and taking out what we believe is a conservative posture in the second half.\nJack Carsky: Next question David?\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nJason Kupferberg: Hi, guys. So the strong dollar obviously as you highlighted has had that negative impact on U.S inbound cross-border travel from some of the key international card. So I just wanted to get your take on whether or not you think that the 7% cross-border volume number through the first three weeks of January will prove to be the trough for the year, because I know you do have some easier comparisons coming up in the March and June quarters in particular.\nByron Pollitt: That one is really hard. We have -- we are projecting off our trending, but the dollar is continuing to strengthen and that strengthening dollar is fundamental to our forecast for the balance of the year in terms of its impact on volume and subsequent impact on revenue.\nJack Carsky: Next question David?\nOperator: The next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Could you provide any clarity you might have Charlie on the rules that are governing the opening of China's domestic payments market and when this might be material for Visa?\nCharles W. Scharf: I guess couple of things first. First I just want to be clear; China is an important market for us today. We don't compete domestically for transactions, but we\u2019ve very close relationships with banks in China where we issue cards that are used outside of China. So to the extent and at the appropriate time when the Chinese marketplace opens we're not starting from ground Zero relative to building relationships within China. Relative to the timing of the open, we really unfortunately cannot provide any additional clarity. We know what you know, which is that the Chinese government made the statement that they will allow domestic competition that they\u2019re in the process of writing those rules and my guess is we'll see them when you see them and we continue to work with our Chinese partners and meet with the government. But relative to when the market will open, what the rules will look like and how meaningful it would be, we really don't know. I would just remind you, well I know a lot of you know this fact, but when they\u2019ve opened the market up in other industries that are industries somewhat like ours, it generally takes a period of time, sometimes quite a significant period of time before it's going to become something significant for the Company.\nJack Carsky: Next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Have you seen any notable difference in the impact of lower gas prices on affluent consumers versus the general population? And maybe on the comments that you\u2019ve made about cross-border, could you kind of address whether you're seeing any early signs of more U.S travel abroad given the strengthening of the U.S dollar and if so, is any of that factored into your outlook?\nByron Pollitt: What we see -- let me take the second one first. What we see for U.S and abroad given the strong dollar is that it has sustained. What we haven\u2019t seen is a -- any sort of spike in U.S travel abroad, which you might hypothesize what happened, given the stronger dollar. But what we\u2019ve seen is a sustaining of healthy growth rates on outbound U.S travel. With regards to gas and impact on affluent, as I mentioned in my remarks, gasoline spend is more debit rated for us than credit. We\u2019ve seen very little impact on spent at the credit level, which is where you would expect more of the affluent to participate. We have seen some impact on debit, which is where you would expect the less affluent to play in greater numbers. So as Charlie talked about, there has been a clear noticeable reduction in debit spend as it relates to gas in the U.S., a portion of which have been redistributed to other categories. But the bulk of which has been for at least for the moment based on our surveys being banked [ph] in the savings category. And just keep in mind that the average of $60 a month -- $60 a month in its own way doesn\u2019t change -- it's unlikely that people change their behavior. I mean if you boil it down to people filling up their tanks once a week, at that point you're down to $15 a week, how are you going to spend differently? So the places that we\u2019re seeing it, which I mentioned are the grocery, fast foods, QSRs especially architecture places where you would see that kind of additional dollar amount. But as I said from a survey is, we know that 50% of its being saved. That amount of money accumulates. People start to see that thy have additional money and then over a period of time we\u2019ll potentially buy higher ticket items is what we would anticipate.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nDon Fandetti: Yes, Charlie, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit on the rollout of tokenization for online, and when you think it could also rollout internationally around Apple Pay. And then lastly, have you seen increased discussions from other smartphone manufacturers and players post to Apple Pay?\nCharles W. Scharf: Sure. On our tokenization efforts we are very actively working with issuers in other parts of the world, and would expect to see some tokenized solutions in the marketplace this calendar year. On the topic of other people whether its handset manufacturers or others there is a very, very active dialogue that\u2019s going on that was happening, but I think the work that Apple has done and winding up in-market with their solution, it certainly accelerated peoples thinking. And we\u2019ve been very, very clear relative to ourselves which is, we are very excited about what Apple is doing. We think it\u2019s a very elegant solution that we are thrilled with our participation in. But we want to enable as many scalable solutions that have wonderful customer interfaces that adhere to the highest security standards. And we would expect to see a series of those in the next couple of quarters come to market.\nJack Carsky: Next question, David.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead with your questions.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I just have one more on FX. How did the hedges affect next year, I mean, did they differ some of the impact that we might have seen if you weren\u2019t hedged this year into next year. And then just one data point question, do you know that sum total of those that are still opt out in the merchant litigation? Thank you.\nByron Pollitt: With regards to the hedges, the answer is, yes. Beginning with the month of October which was, it\u2019s the beginning of our fiscal year. We start doing 12 months forecasts out and start layering in hedges 12 months out. So, January -- this is January, so the hedges we put on this month will be for -- will cover, throughout the end of January we will have the hedges in place that will cover the first four months of next years fiscal year. And I\u2019d say for better or for worse. If the dollar continues to strengthen, then the hedges will provide benefit and if it goes the other way, the opposite, and remember the objective here is to simply dampen, not eliminate. We are not insulated from FX. What we try and do with the hedges is flatten out somewhat the volatility. And I might also add, that what we solve through in hedges is not revenue, its actually operating income. So, we hedge again certain risk point levels by currency against our operating income, which means we use the expenses in other currencies as a natural hedge and then we put on our transactional hedges beyond the natural hedge of the expense we incur in the non-U.S. currencies.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\nMoshe Katri: Hey, guys. Can you talk a bit about tokenization? Where are we in terms of introducing on the service to banks, and some of the feedback, and then maybe you can talk a bit about, how should we think about this looking into next year? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf: So, those financial institutions that I referenced in my opening remarks are all using our token services for Apple Pay. And as I said, we\u2019re working with another 500 or so institutions here currently to get them involved in Apple Pay and therefore using our to tokenization service because that is a prerequisite for participating in Apple Pay. As I said before, we continue to work with issuers around the world and expect to see more tokenized solutions as time goes on. What was the second part of the question?\nByron Pollitt: There was a second part that I didn\u2019t answer to Sanjay\u2019s question. So let me just, if I could let me just add that in real quick. The question was, I believe how much opt outs remain in the MDL litigation. That number we don\u2019t have, but immediately accessible. But to be hopeful here, we think it\u2019s better to think about it in terms of the payment volume represented by the opt-outs. Charlie tell you that, to date we have settled and actually paid out of our escrow $335 million or so, out of an escrow that was $1.5 billion at the beginning of the fiscal year. Think of that as settling out a little over 20% of the payment volume represented by the opt-outs before these payments began.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you. Good afternoon. I just wanted to get an update on CyberSource if I could and, the trends in that business what you\u2019re doing to improve that business and, who maybe -- what competitors are you finding most difficult as far as loosing market share?\nByron Pollitt: So, on CyberSource we had a good holiday season. We grew at -- transactions grew at about 16%, that\u2019s up from 12% in the prior reporting period. We honestly is that, which we have mentioned on prior calls, we missed an investment cycle maybe to in this product, we are rapidly reinvesting, re-platforming to enable much better client service as transactions accelerate in terms of capacity utilization. And so, this is a business we\u2019re very committed to. It\u2019s been an excellent vertical extension of our business model and we remain very vested in bringing the platform to world class levels again and to accelerate the growth rates above which we have even most recently been experiencing.\nCharles W. Scharf: And the only thing I would get -- just add a couple of things to it. Number one is, I mean we think about CyberSource in two different ways. We think about it as a, how is it doing as a standalone business? And we think about how is CyberSource helping the rest of Visa. As Byron mentioned on the standalone business, we\u2019ve been very clear that we did miss an investment cycle here. We had a very clear roadmap internally that both relates to customer facing improvements such as time to onboard and things like that, as well as some infrastructure changes that we\u2019re making. That\u2019s a roadmap of call it a year or so, and that\u2019s how long it will take us. So we would expect to see some volatility from the existing client base as we go through those changes but it\u2019s the right thing for us for the long-term. Separately from us and this gets to just the overall point for us with CyberSource. CyberSource is an extremely important part of the company. When we talk about leveraging merchant relationships and talk about wanting to build broader capabilities and things that, conversations that we\u2019re having in the marketplace, in order to do that CyberSource is just a wonderful addition for us to be able to be a partner to either enable those conversations or to be part of those conversations. And quite frankly for us to start from scratch on merchant relationships is very, very different than to be able to start with a CyberSource inside the company.\nJack Carsky: Next question, David.\nOperator: The next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nJames Schneider: Thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Relative to your commentary on incentives, I believe last time you had talked about incentives being front half loaded in the first part of the fiscal year. And I think today you said that you now expect them to be, to trend upwards as we go through the year. Has something changed in terms of deals pushed out or additional deals signed. Maybe give us some color on the cadence of those incentives as we go through the year?\nByron Pollitt: One of the things we\u2019ve learned over the past seven years is that, we have been doing earnings calls is that incentives is very difficult to project quarter-by-quarter. We have gotten pretty good at projecting it on the full year basis. And so, with every passing quarter we get smarter about the deals that close, and the deals that are taking longer to close that we thought might close. And so, nothing has occurred that has changed our outlook for the year. But we are reaffirming the lumpiness of incentives and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re seeing here. We have one quarter in the bag and three to go and we\u2019re very comfortable with our guidance of 17% to 18.5% and we expect the three out-quarters to run at a higher rate than what you saw in the recently completed Q1.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSmitti Srethapramote: Thank you. At your analyst day a year and half ago, you guys estimated that there would be 38 million mobile plant cell [ph] locations by 2017. Just wondering if you guys can give us an update in terms of how things have played out versus your initial expectations and are there any particular geographies where you\u2019ve seen acceptance increased noticeably due to mPOS?\nByron Pollitt: That\u2019s a good question, and I have the number, but I don\u2019t have it now in terms of how many mPOS locations there are. But the number is growing extraordinarily quickly. The last number -- Canada, Australia and other places, I mean the numbers that I saw were several quarters ago, actually probably its almost a year ago, we\u2019re probably at $5 million and I believe the number was over $10 million, the last time I checked. So, I mean, the growth is happening and in addition to just the mPOS devices out there, usage is what's extraordinarily important. So, we can make sure we get you that number and next time we talk publicly we\u2019ll make sure we\u2019ll mention it, so everyone has it.\nJack Carsky: Our next question, David.\nOperator: The next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nTien-tsin Huang: Great, thanks. Charlie, it sounds like you said -- I think you said you can protect the bottom line of, if the macro deteriorates here. Can you elaborate, was that an expense comment and maybe can you just give us an update on the timing of the CFO search? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf: Sure. So, on the first one, listen I think my comments are quite simple which is, the economic environment in terms of what we\u2019re seeing with the strengthening dollar obviously makes our jobs more difficult. The point of what I was trying to say was, we are not changing our spending patterns, the projects we have underway based upon what we\u2019re seeing in the world today. We\u2019re not laying people off. We\u2019re not even thinking about doing anything like that. We\u2019re continuing to push forward to grow the company because we think that\u2019s the right long-term thing for us to do given the opportunity, and we think as Byron just went through, we think we\u2019ll continue to perform as a company. Having said that, we also just always remind ourselves that like any company you can always tighten up and you can always go through and prioritize and figure out what the most important thing to do is and you really have to do every last thing. And if we got particularly noticed that what we are seeing in the world would affect us in any kind of meaningful way beyond what we expected. We have the ability to do that. And we\u2019re not contemplating that and even if we did that, we would assume -- assume we would do it in an intelligent way that still allows us to invest in the right thing. So, the point is if we had to and if we thought it was prudent we could reduce the expense base of the company or certainly slow the expense growth but not something we\u2019re contemplating doing right now. And on the CFO search, I would hope -- I hope we have something to report shortly on that.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Just a couple of clarifications. I guess, Charlie what's the strategy for rolling out tokenization for browser based ecommerce? I guess, I was under the impression, this spring you guys will be rolling something out. I\u2019m just curious what the plans are there? And then, secondly Byron on FX, just given your comments on some of the hedges in the rolling off of some hedges. Should we think start modeling in a couple of point impact for fiscal year \u201916? Thanks so much.\nCharles W. Scharf: So, on the first piece. In the spring of this year we will have some tokenized solutions in the marketplace for some browser enabled solutions.\nByron Pollitt: Okay. And on the FX, Bryan I wish I had a crystal ball. But let me relay the following circumstance which is the dilemma. When we gave foreign exchange guidance on the fourth quarter call we had a full year of hedges in place. Three months later, we\u2019re saying that the interim FX developments have negatively impacted our revenue growth by about 50 basis points. So, within three months of our last projection of FX we\u2019re off 50 basis points in the year it was hedged. So, we are not yet ready to talk about FY \u201916. That said, your projection of just how strong, how much further strengthening the U.S. dollar can achieve. How long it can sustain at this level before the inevitable cycle goes back the other way, is as good a guess as ours will be. In terms of impact, we\u2019re using as our best proxy the December 31, forward exchange rates.\nJack Carsky: Next question, David.\nOperator: The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. Could you talk a little bit, I mean you mentioned during the opening comments about the holiday spending being a little different kind of debit spending being affected by gasoline. Are there trends that you think that will be persisting throughout 2015. I know we\u2019ve got some differences in the way tax refunds are going to be paid this year. I mean any other things that we should be aware of as we go through \u201915 particularly in the U.S. and keeping that stuff in mind?\nByron Pollitt: I guess, because we spend a lot of time tearing apart everything that we can find about the holiday spend numbers. The stuff -- the things I talked about were the most important for us isolating the conversion, so you get a real underlying view of spend. We have talked about the impact of gas and what we would expect to be the ongoing impact of gas. The only thing which we didn\u2019t cover here which we spend a lot of time talking about is ecommerce volume. Ecommerce was extraordinarily strong during the holiday season which is a continuation of what we have seen. Growth rates of ecommerce were two to three times what they were in the physical world. And for us, we like that, because cash doesn\u2019t work in the online world. And so, we have got a much higher participation rate in the ecommerce world than we do in the face to face world. Other than that nothing is coming to mind, Moshe.\nJack Carsky: Next question, David.\nOperator: The next question is from Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Maurer: Yes, good evening. Thanks. First, could you give us a little bit of commentary on the impact that pricing changes that we have seen reported by the acquirers will contribute to your guidance on revenue growth? And secondly, we have seen EVMCo produce a draft of 3DS 2.0 based on Visa and MasterCard\u2019s work indicating that you\u2019ll be able to take additional authentication metrics into account starting in, at the beginning of \u201916. Does this also mean that what we\u2019ll get a card holder present like interchange tier to show up at time as well? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf: Let me take the first one. As we described on our fourth quarter call, we have a number of price adjustments that will take place in the second half, U.S. acquiring card service fees in April roughly two basis points, about 40 basis points on U.S. acquiring ISA again in that April timeframe, these get faced in. So, no impact in Q2, fiscal Q2, a beginning in fiscal Q3, full impact in Q4. So as you think about modeling it on a fiscal year basis we would expect our lowest revenue growth rate to be in the upcoming Q2, and then as the price adjustments start to kick in delving in Q3 and then by Q4 having an impact that would bring us to double digit revenue growth in fiscal Q4. Put that altogether and we are still reaffirming the guidance we gave in Q4 for the full year, but today largely because of FX at the lower end of that range.\nByron Pollitt: And then on your second question, I wouldn\u2019t relate those two dates. The work we\u2019re doing on 3D secure, in re-looking at the rates as we said. As with tokenized solutions being in the marketplace, we are constantly looking at what makes sense, constantly looking at the fraud, looking at the value added. And if it makes sense for us at some point to do something different within a change rates, we\u2019ll do it. But right now, we have no specific plans to talk about.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nTimothy Willi: Thanks and good afternoon. Charlie, just going back to your comments, I guess throughout the class action that is starting to settle with those that opted out et cetera. Any comments you would have just around sort of the tone of collaboration, with yourself and the retailers would sort of come to the end of this, and just trying that into anything we should think about maybe longer term around rebates and incentives and the mix that would move more towards retailers versus banks, if there is anything we should consider there?\nCharles W. Scharf: No, on the first piece, listen I think -- our relationships with merchants as we have said are extraordinarily important to us. Being able to settle these lawsuits is a good thing. It puts that conversation behind us and it an opportunity to talk about things that we can do together, the most obvious thing that I can talk about Visa Checkout. The idea of merchants advertising along side us, promoting something isn\u2019t something that would even have been contemplated a couple of years ago. And they are doing it because -- not because they like us as people, they\u2019re doing it because we have a product which they believe is good for them. When you\u2019re buying something in the ecommerce space, you put something in the card to checkout. What you want as a retailer is you want someone to actually pay for that. And for us to be able to bring a solution to market which has a much higher close rate, which is easy to use, where we can leverage our brand jointly, and ultimately by the way bring new customers to them is something that excites them. And so, those are the kinds of conversations that are very different that we\u2019re able to have today. Not everyone is in that bucket, but that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. We would like to have that kind of partnership with everyone. And as I said before, that\u2019s something that is going to play out over a long period of time. We know we have to prove to merchants that we can show up with solutions that are better for them, as I went through at Visa Checkout. As we announced a quarter or two ago with something called Visa Transaction Advisors, where we\u2019ve now turned out broaden analytics talents towards helping oil companies reduce fraud at the fuel pumps through risk scoring that we do on a real time basis for them. So, I would describe it as, it\u2019s encouraging, but it\u2019s a long-term discussion where there have been proof points in the marketplace and you\u2019ll start seeing them over a period of time.\nByron Pollitt: And with regards to incentives, Tim, the main action as it relates to incentives doesn\u2019t really today, it has little to do with MDL and much more to do with outrank in debit related to routing. That said going forward, I think as we increasingly introduce new product initiatives, new services and where we want to accelerate trial and adoption, we\u2019re prepared to put some incentives on the table to help crime in the pump and as a way of crafting a smart market entry using the merchants as a launch partner for services that will be good for the network and all its participants.\nJack Carsky: And with that we have time for one last question.\nOperator: And your final question comes from Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.\nLisa Ellis: [Indiscernible] at the end. Thanks guys. Hey, Charlie I just wanted to follow-up on the point you made on ecommerce. First, could you give an update on the mix of revenue or volume you\u2019re seeing to the e-commerce channel and the card mix as well? And then, second question is about the fed strategy paper on approving the U.S payment system that was released on Monday. I\u2019d love just your thoughts on that, the level of involvement or engagement you guys have had with the fed and how you see it impacting your business?\nByron Pollitt: So on the first don\u2019t have a lot of color. We\u2019ve not release numbers like that either by product or exactly what the mix is, but obviously given you what the relative growth rates are and so hopefully that\u2019s helpful. On the fed paper, first of all, we\u2019re very actively involved with the fed as many others are. We participate in the dialogue that they\u2019ve -- that they\u2019ve had up to this point leading up to the paper that they just released. And our experience has been that they\u2019ve been extremely inclusive with all partners seeking input. I\u2019d say, in terms of what it means for us, I mean, I don't think any of us exactly know and I think that will play itself out. What we do know is that we\u2019ve a network that works extraordinarily well, that provides great value for people that run transactions over it and a lot of what we do isn\u2019t easily duplicated. And its one thing to say that you're going to build something, its nothing to actually get it in the marketplace with the ability to put value added services around it. The people that participate in our network, the four parties get paid for it or they get benefits from it and they do it because they actually get those things out of it. So there are some very natural reasons why networks like ours and our competitors are attractive in the marketplace out there whether you\u2019re an issuer or whether you\u2019re an acceptor of the products. And as we\u2019ve talked about, what we spend our time, I mean, I don\u2019t want to underestimate the importance of running the network well, we spend a lot of time making sure that that\u2019s the case. We spend a lot of time on network security, but we spend even more time building value added products around it and the idea is that you run transaction over the Visa network and there is more value to you, because of either services we provide, whether its on a risk basis, whether its things that can help you grow your revenues and we\u2019re working on a series of things now that you will start to see in the marketplace. So again over a period of time, if people have a choice where to run their transaction over it, we\u2019re not going to sit here and say well, we just have a really good network, so you should run it over ours which we want to give both merchants, issuers and consumers ultimately reasons to want to use our network as opposed to any other solution out there. End of Q&A\nJack Carsky: And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining us today. If anyone has any follow-up questions, feel free to give Victoria or myself a call. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa, Inc.'s 2016 fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year earnings conference call. Joining us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. The PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website as well. Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of Visa's website. For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: Thanks very much, Jack, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us. Let me start with a few comments about our fiscal fourth quarter financial results. First of all, as you can see with the inclusion of Visa Europe, the quarter and our thoughts on next year will be somewhat complicated, but we will do our best to provide clarity on what's driving our results both in my remarks but probably more importantly in Vasant's remarks as he goes through the detail. Overall, we feel very good about the solid financial results in the fourth quarter. The results were better than our expectations. GAAP EPS of $0.79 included two special items, the $110 million charge for severance costs and the $88 million non-cash and non-recurring gain for the remeasurement of the deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted GAAP EPS was $0.78 per share, an increase of 27%. Net operating revenue grew 19% this quarter, including the full quarter of Visa Europe and a continued negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. While growth continues to be subdued by some of the same items we've spoken about previously, we're starting to see improvements as we expected, and our business model, as you've seen, continues to be resilient. I would be remiss if I didn't mention last week's 18% dividend increase to $0.165 per quarter. We continue to be consistent in returning excess capital to our shareholders. Let me turn now and talk for a couple of minutes about payments volume. U.S. payments volume growth was 11% in the fourth quarter, up 1 percentage point from Q3. U.S. credit payments volume improved to 19% from 11% in the June quarter, primarily driven by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. U.S. debit payments volume grew at 3%, down from 9% in the quarter. The lower growth was primarily driven by Interlink, and remember, the impact to revenue of this is minimal. International payments constant dollar volume growth ex-Europe was 9%. Cross-border volume growth accelerated to 10% \u2013 when normalized for Europe, up from 9% in the third quarter. Process transaction growth was 12% and accelerated 1 point from the third quarter when normalized for Europe as well. More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth was 12%, up 1 percentage point from the fourth quarter. U.S. credit grew 20%, up 1 percentage point from the September quarter. U.S. debit grew 5%, an improvement from the 3% in the fiscal Q4. Cross-border growth in constant dollars is 11% when normalized for Europe, and processed transactions was 12% when normalized for Europe. Just a few comments about Europe. The integration itself is going extremely well. We just couldn't be happier with the interaction between the two companies, and we are well underway to putting all of the functions together and operating seamlessly as one global entity. Importantly, renewal activity continues to be very strong. We've signed multiyear debit agreements with RBS and Lloyds Banking Group and multiyear credit and debit agreements with Barclays and Nationwide. We have very good engagement with clients on our product and our digital roadmap, including Visa Checkout, which is being rolled out as we speak. Vasant will discuss in more detail how we're doing financially but things are playing out as we would've expected so far. And around rest of the globe, client activity continues to remain very strong. To name just a few, we renewed a multiyear debit and credit partnership with BBVA Bancomer, Mexico. We renewed our credit partnership with China Merchants Bank and China CITIC Bank. And in Russia, we renewed multiyear credit partnerships with Alfa-Bank and VTB24. If you turn just to talk for a couple of minutes about Visa Checkout. We ended fiscal 2016 with over 15 million consumer accounts in 21 countries, and over 1,400 financial institution partners across the globe participating. More than 300,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $162 billion in addressable volume. In October, we rolled out a redesigned Visa Checkout experience to all global merchants. This new experience makes it easier for consumers to sign up and complete purchases on mobile devices. We also announced earlier today that we're opening the Visa Checkout platform to clients and partners, allowing them to integrate their digital wallets into Visa Checkout for streamlined authentication and checkout. Leading Visa financial institutions and partners, such as Google's Android Pay, will take advantage of the new open platform by offering Visa Checkout to their customers for online purchases. Issuers, digital wallets and payment app providers can access a streamline set of APIs to easily integrate Visa Checkout open platform and immediately begin to offer payments to their customers shopping online on their mobile devices. For example, an online shopper who uses a digital wallet from a participating Visa issuer or Android Pay would simply click the Visa Checkout button on a merchant's checkout page and authenticate their identity through biometrics to complete a purchase. Let me move on to another topic. We continue to invest in new products and services to help our merchant clients. In September, we announced Visa advertising solutions, a new suite of products specifically built to help merchants reach new customers and understand if their digital advertising efforts are influencing consumer purchases, purchasing decisions online and in-store. Visa Ad Measurement and Visa Audiences are products that integrate with ad tech platforms like Oracle Data Cloud, allowing Visa's merchants to easily access valuable insights when executing a digital ad campaign. Top quick service restaurants and retail merchants such as Banana Republic have used Visa Ad Measurement reports to understand sales impact and optimize their marketing campaigns. Visa Advertising Solutions are available to merchants through leading digital platforms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest, and over 200 other media networks. We've spoken about this before, but I do want to highlight the success that we're seeing in our global network of innovation centers. In addition to One Market Street in San Francisco, we've opened innovation centers in Singapore in April, Dubai in May, Miami in June, and plans to launch one in New York in January as well as London and S\u00e3o Paulo. In 2016 alone, we held over 600 client engagements globally with over 200 clients participating. These range from tours and demos to multi-day hackathons and in-depth co-creation sessions. These are forums where we can demonstrate where we think payments are going in each geography, but our goal is to develop real-time solutions with clients that they can implement very quickly. Fast payments continues to be an important opportunity around the world, and we're having good success working with clients and partners to capture the opportunity using our Visa Direct push payment product platform. Annual Visa Direct PV exceeds $29 billion globally for the period ending September 16, and annual U.S. Visa Direct volumes topped $5 billion for the first time ending September 2016. Growth exceeds 250% from the same period last year. Globally, nearly 3 billion Visa cards are enabled to receive push payments. We're working with key partners, including EWS, FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry, Stripe, Ingo Money, Square, and Green Dot. I also want to talk for a minute about how we're using push payments to electronify payments in developing economies. We recently launched a new service called mVisa in India, Kenya, and Rwanda, and we plan to expand to several other markets around the world during 2017. mVisa allows a consumer to transfer money to a merchant in real time with nothing more than their mobile phone, and merchants are able to start accepting Visa transactions immediately without any additional hardware. We've seen early success in several different categories, including small micro-merchants, local transportation such as taxi, and bill payment. You'll likely hear much more in the future about these efforts. Tokenization continues to be a very important part of ensuring safe and secure mobile payment solutions. We recently announced new specifications that allow certified third parties to connect directly to our Token Service and become Token Service Providers. These TSPs will be able to provide a range of services for Visa tokens, including new account provisioning and life cycle management. By expanding access to the Visa Token Service to new partners, Visa issuers will be able to more quickly and easily offer secure digital payment services across a wide range of devices. I'll let Vasant talk in detail about our outlook for 2017, but just a few comments from me. We enter 2017 certainly with fewer headwinds as we did entering 2016, and we do have some tailwinds. On the negative side, the global economy is not improving. Geopolitical tensions are high. The U.S. election is a wild card, and we continue to watch the impact of Brexit. But Costco and USAA meaningfully improved volumes, with USAA being an important contributor to revenues in the U.S., while Costco far less so. Cross-border volumes are both lapping decreases and have improved, and we will have a full-year benefit from Europe, which as I said, is performing as expected. Since this is my last call, I do want to make just a few closing comments. I'm so proud to have been associated with Visa, its clients, its partners, and its employees. I hope you feel that this is a different company than four years ago and that the things we've done have positioned the company well for the future. We've focused our work on providing payments leadership and a platform which will enable our clients, all clients, to grow their franchises. The competition is strong and the canvas is still being painted as the industry evolves, but our position is strong and our assets are exceptional. And always keep in mind as we think about what's going on around the world and we look at the risks and opportunity, this is a very global business. The competitive issues are different geography by geography, but opportunities exist around the world for us to grow our share. While there's always risk and many are trying to figure out how to advantage themselves as commerce moves to digital platforms, there is more opportunity globally than ever before for Visa. Vasant?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Thank you, Charlie. For the full quarter of Visa Europe and our numbers for the first time, we had a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter revenues were up 19%, operating income up 15%, and EPS up 28%. We closed FY 2016 with full-year revenues of $15 billion, net income of $6 billion, and EPS at $2.48. On an adjusted basis, operating income for the fourth quarter was up 20% and EPS was up 27%. Net income for the full year was $6.9 billion, and EPS was $2.84. For the remainder of my comments, I will be referring to adjusted results. A few points to note; first, payment volumes on a constant dollar basis continue to grow at double-digit rates globally. The secular shift away from cash continues at a fast clip around the world. Credit growth outstripped debit growth, helped by Costco and USAA. Second, cross-border constant dollar volume growth recovered to double-digit levels. The dollar has stabilized, helping our large U.S. acquired business. In addition, oil price stability and a nascent recovery in emerging markets has helped outbound commerce across most regions. Only Europe slowed due to general economic weakness as well as the impact of the Brexit vote on the euro and the pound. Easier year-over-year comparisons are also helping. Third, we had two special items in the quarter that largely offset each other. We took a charge for severance costs associated with actions we are implementing across Visa, including the reductions we're planning to make at Visa Europe. The consultation process is underway in Europe, and we expect it will be completed before the end of 2016, after which we will begin to implement the agreed-upon plan. As we integrate Europe into the rest of Visa, we have taken the opportunity, as we told you we would, to look at our global cost structure and will make some adjustments. Offsetting this charge was a non-recurring, non-cash tax benefit from the reduction in the UK corporate tax rate, which reduced our UK deferred tax liability. Finally, as you know, we issued preferred shares for the Visa Europe acquisition. We also bought back 20.5 million shares in the fourth quarter for $1.66 billion. We ended the quarter with a weighted average share count of 2.44 billion, up 54 million from Q3. For the full year fiscal year 2016, we bought back 92 million shares for $7.1 billion, at an average price of $77.13. This was approximately $2 billion higher than what our normal course buyback would have been last year. The additional buyback reflects our intent to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred shares issued, and will continue into early fiscal year 2018, as we previously indicated. I'll quickly review business drivers and financial results for the quarter and fiscal year 2016; then spend most of my time on our outlook for FY 2017. At least for this quarter, we will highlight the impact of adding in Visa Europe where it is helpful to better understand our results. U.S. payment volumes grew 11% in Q4 as U.S. credit grew 19%, helped by USAA and Costco volumes. U.S. debit grew 3% due to lapping a significant new account win in our Interlink business in Q4 last year and the impact of PIN Debit routing this quarter. Adjusted for Interlink volumes, the U.S. debit growth trend was unchanged from the prior quarter. As merchants make routing decisions based on incentive deals in place with various networks, we expect there will continue to be volatility in our Interlink growth rates. However, given the relative size of this business, the impact on our total revenues will be minimal. International payment volumes ex-Europe grew 9% in constant dollars. The tick down from the prior quarter trend was largely due to the lapping effect of a large Chinese bank that started including previously unreported domestic volumes in Q3 last year. Ex-China, growth rates remain strong in Asia as well as Latin America. The Middle East and Russia was stable but Sub-Saharan Africa was a soft spot. In Europe, new regulations that went into effect in June no longer require issuers of co-badged cards to report domestic volumes we do not process. This will distort year-over-year comparisons throughout fiscal year 2017. Excluding Europe, cross-border constant dollar growth rates stepped up to 10% in Q4. This was the first time we have reported double-digit cross-border volume growth since Q4 fiscal year 2014. The weakening dollar is driving the recovery in our large U.S. acquired business as well as outbound commerce from Canada. Cross-border growth in North America climbed to 9%, a rate of growth we have not seen since the end of 2013. Internationally, cross-border growth rate stepped up across all geographies, helped by stabilizing oil prices and recovering emerging markets. Cross-border growth rates in China have stabilized in the mid-single digits. The only region ticking down in growth was Europe, as the weak pound post-Brexit has hurt outbound commerce from the UK Excluding Europe, transactions processed over VisaNet grew 11%. The small step up from the prior quarter was due to the NSPK effect in Russia. As you know, our reported transactions growth was hurt in the past five quarters as we transitioned processing to NSPK starting in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. Transactions processed in Europe grew 15%, in line with the previous quarter. Net revenues grew 19% in Q4, 6% excluding the impact of Europe. Expenses grew 18%, 5% excluding Europe. We finished the year with adjusted EPS of $2.84. If you exclude the impact of the Visa Europe acquisition, which is interest expense from the debt issued, the shares issued, as well as Europe's income and other one-time items, our EPS grew 10% in nominal dollars and 14% in constant dollars. We were able to deliver this growth despite a soft revenue picture caused by the strong dollar, the oil and commodity price collapse impacting many regions, as well as a slowdown in China. We were able to hold fiscal year 2016 expense growth to 1% ex-Europe while continuing to invest heavily in all our critical long-term initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Developer platform, our Innovation Centers, our marketing around the Rio Olympics and other programs. We enter fiscal year 2017 with some tailwinds. Costco and USAA conversions are now well underway, as you saw from our Q4 payment volumes. Cross-border growth rates have recovered as the dollar stabilizes and we have easier year-over-year comparisons. Two significant drags from prior year's is the translation impact of the strong dollar and gas price declines. We begin to benefit from the Visa Europe acquisition with yield improvements, cost reductions, and EPS accretion. Balancing these tailwinds are some headwinds: economic weakness in Europe and Brexit uncertainty hurting both domestic and cross-border volumes; a global economy that remains generally sluggish; a potential decline in Treasury revenues as volatility subsides from the extraordinary high levels we have experienced in the past two years; and finally, a step-up in client incentives as we bring on Costco and other major renewals, as well as folding in Europe. We'll review how all these factors drive our outlook for 2017 starting with payments volumes. USAA and Costco will drive payments volume growth in the U.S. However, we expect international payments volume growth to slow down modestly due to weakness in Europe and China. Reported European payment volume numbers will be distorted by the change in co-badged volume reporting. If no co-badge volume is included, reported European payment volumes could be down 15% to 20% dragging the reported global payments growth down by as much 7 to 8 percentage points with a larger impact in the first three quarters. As you saw in Q4, cross-border volumes are recovering helped by easier comparisons, a stabilizing dollar and oil prices as well as improving emerging market economies. In Europe, cross-border growth rates have been trending down through fiscal year 2016 and we anticipate that this will continue as the pound remains weak and economies across Europe struggle. Inbound commerce into the U.S. will likely grow after two consecutive years of decline. Outbound commerce is expected to recover in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. In Asia, Chinese cross-border growth appear to have stabilized. The recovery in cross-border growth maybe offset to some degree by a decline in currency volatilities and the revenue we derive from it. Currency volatilities have been extraordinarily high for the past couple of years, well above long-term averages. At some point there will be a reversion to the mean or even an overcorrection in the other direction like we saw in 2014. For purposes of our outlook, we're resuming what we did last year, a reversion to the mean in fiscal year 2017. But as they say, it will be what it will be. With the NSPK transition behind us in Russia, debit gains in Brazil, Costco and USAA volumes in the U.S., we expect process transactions growth to tick up in FY 2017 ex-Europe. European process transaction growth rates will slow down as we lap the rapid acceleration of contactless transactions in the UK in fiscal year 2016. We finished FY 2016 with client incentives as a percent of gross revenues, approaching 19% in the second half. Our outlook anticipates a range of 20.5% to 21.5% in fiscal year 2017, a 1.5 points to 2.5 points increase. There are several factors driving this increase. About half of the year-over-year increase is driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe for the full year, and the impact of eliminating rebates and replacing them with performance-based client incentives. In our filings with Visa Europe numbers for the first three quarters of FY 2016 that you have seen, U.S. GAAP accounting requires that rebates are netted from gross revenues. When we eliminated rebates at the end of September, it has the effect of increasing Visa Europe's gross fiscal year 2017 revenues and in parallel, Visa Europe's fiscal year 2017 client incentives, as we replace these rebates with appropriate market competitive incentives. The net effect of this change in the European pricing structure and the overall level of client incentives in Europe accounts for about half the increase from 19% in Q4 to the range we provided for fiscal year 2017. The other half of the year-over-year step-up in client incentives as a percent of gross revenues is driven by a full year of Costco incentives, and the impact of several large renewals completed in fiscal year 2016, particularly in Asia. When you put all this together, we expect constant dollar net revenue growth in the high teens in fiscal year 2017, moderated to the 16% to 18% range in nominal dollars by an estimated 1-point to 1.5-point exchange rate impact. This currency translation impact may be larger than you are anticipating, based on dollar spot rates of forward curves. Let me explain why this is the case. It has to do with our longstanding practice of layering on monthly hedges, no different than what most global companies do. This approach to hedging is not seeking to make directional bets on currencies, but rather to dampen the effect of changes in the trend of the dollar. When the dollar strengthens, these hedges delay the cost, and when the dollar weakens, they delay the benefit, essentially mitigating volatility. In fiscal year 2016, the hedges helped in the first half, and then as the dollar started to weaken, they hurt in the second half. This will continue into fiscal year 2017. The hedges in place will be a drag in the first half. If the dollar stabilizes as currency forwards are suggesting, they will be neutral in the second half. The total exchange rate drag on net revenues could be 2 points, 2.5 points in the first quarter, comparable to Q4 FY 2016, moderating through the year to 0.5 point in Q4 FY 2017. On the expense front, we will continue to invest as aggressively as we need to on all our key growth initiatives, including the global expansion of Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, and Visa Innovation Centers. We will continue to build on our Visa Developer platform, our data and analytics capabilities, loyalty and offers, mVisa, and other key programs. In parallel, as we have done in fiscal year 2017, we will look to gain efficiencies in other parts of our business by enhancing productivity and adding capabilities in lower cost locations. Excluding Europe, we expect expense growth to return to the mid-single digit range in fiscal year 2017. In terms of the expense base in Europe, after the consultation process is completed, we will implement our plan. While this will reduce costs in some areas, we will be investing in Europe to roll out Visa Checkout and our other digital services, as well as adding to our sales and marketing resources to bring all the benefits of Global Visa to our European clients as fast as we can. We will also incur approximately $80 million in Visa Europe integration costs in fiscal year 2017. These are costs to harmonize the two technology platforms. Our technology teams are in the process of aligning authorization clearance and settlement systems, upgrading network compute and storage infrastructure, implementing next generation information security systems, preparing to move to common end user and corporate platform. As you may recall, we had indicated that the technology integration would not be completed until late 2019, early 2020. We had estimated total integration costs in the $450 million to $500 million range over this timeframe. While these are not recurring costs, we will incur these costs for the next three years until we complete the full integration of Visa Europe. We will call these costs out as we have in our outlook, however, we do not plan to adjust these costs from our GAAP numbers when we report each quarter. Of course, these integration costs will not be incurred once the technology integration is complete. Also, as we have indicated, additional cost savings will be realized when we combine the technology platform. It is important to highlight one item that you need to adjust for as you consolidate Visa Europe into Visa, Inc. Prior to the acquisition, as you all know, there were intercompany charges that flowed between Visa Europe and Visa, Inc. These were expenses for Visa Europe and revenues for Visa, Inc. The largest item was the Visa Europe license fee. The other major charge was for network processing services provided by Visa, Inc. Through the first three quarters of fiscal year 2016, these intercompany charges amounted to $191 million. Two-thirds were recognized as other revenues in the Visa, Inc. income statement, and the remainder in data processing revenues. At Visa Europe, one-third of the expense hit the network and processing line, and most of the rest was in G&A with a small amount in personnel. Post the acquisition, these intercompany revenues and expenses completely offset one another and are eliminated in consolidation. Therefore, none of these revenues and expense amounts are included in the reported fourth quarter numbers or will be included going forward. If you do not adjust for these changes, your FY 2016 baseline for Visa Europe operating expenses would be overstated by $191 million, as would your fiscal year 2016 baseline for Visa, Inc. revenues. In terms of costs related to China market entry, the timing remains uncertain. We had assumed we would be much further along at this point when we talked to you last year. It is our intent to move very fast to set up our processing infrastructure once we have greater clarity from the PBOC around timelines for their decision for granting licenses. At this point, it is difficult to know for sure what costs related to China market entry will be incurred in fiscal year 2017. We have made some assumptions in our outlook and will update you as we learn more. Moving on to interest and taxes, interest expense will increase almost 40% in fiscal year 2017 from a full year of interest on the $16 billion in debt issued in December 2015 as well as the $2 billion in debt we plan to issue before the end of this calendar year, market conditions permitting. Our fiscal year 2017 tax rate will increase due to Visa Europe. As you know, under the current structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. taxpayer. The current tax structure affords us some cash tax benefits but has the effect of increasing our book or GAAP tax rate due to restrictions on the credits we can take on taxes we pay in the UK. As we had indicated previously, this structure increases our reported tax rate by 100 basis points to the low-30s range. As you estimate our fiscal year 2017 EPS, it's important to remember that we issued 79 million preferred shares as part of the consideration for Visa Europe. These shares are now included in our fully diluted share count, which is up 54 million net of buybacks completed in the fourth quarter. We have ramped up our buyback program to offset the dilutive impact of the shares issued. In fiscal year 2017, our bought back almost $5 billion more roughly at the same level as fiscal year 2016. At this pace, by the end of 2017, we would have bought back almost $5 billion more than our normal course buyback or offset almost 80% of stock issued. We will maintain the stepped up pace of buybacks till we complete this program in early fiscal year 2018. With a full year of interest expense as well as $2 billion more in debt, with a higher GAAP tax rate, and with additional shares outstanding, our EPS growth rate in fiscal year 2017 will be lower than net revenue growth. In nominal terms, our outlook anticipates mid-teens EPS growth from an adjusted fiscal year 2016 baseline of $2.84. This includes a 1.5 to 2 point drag from exchange rates, mostly due to the impact of hedging described earlier. As with revenues, the drag from exchange rates will be higher than the first half, comparable to fourth quarter 2016 levels in Q1, and moderating through the year. Our EPS outlook assumes EPS accretion from Visa Europe will be in the 2% to 3% range in fiscal year 2017 as expected. The accretive impact of Visa Europe is greater in the second and third quarters when we had interest expense last year from debt issued for the transaction but no income from Visa Europe till the fourth quarter. Also benefits from our cost reduction actions start being realized in the second quarter. Visa Europe is tracking well relative to our expectations, and we remain confident that accretion will climb to the high-single digit range by 2020 once we have implemented all our plans to improve yield and lower costs. In summary, we feel good about fiscal year 2017. The Visa Europe integration is proceeding well and delivering as expected. Payment volume momentum remains robust globally. Transactions growth remains healthy. Cross-border volumes are recovering as the dollar stabilizes and comparisons become easier. Gas prices and exchange rate drags are easing. As always, there are risks to watch. The global economy remains sluggish, especially in Europe. The cross-border business in Europe is slowing. Currency volatility could moderate. Balancing these factors, our fiscal year 2017 outlook anticipates 16% to 18% net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in nominal dollars. As always, we will update our views as the year unfolds and share them with you each quarter. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jack.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, Vasant. Laura, at this time, we're ready to start taking questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for all the details, and I have a lot to go through here. I wanted to ask on revenue growth contribution from Visa Europe assumed in fiscal 2017. What's being assumed there? And what's the Visa Europe yield assumption as well? Do you need yields to rise in order to hit guidance? Thank you and best wishes to you, Charlie.\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, Tien-Tsin.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Tien-Tsin, going through your questions, if you look at next year, I think we tried to give you as much as we can in terms of what we see in terms of trends. So clearly from a growth rate standpoint, you have a sense of what growth in Europe has been this year. We are seeing, as you saw through the year, some slowdown in the cross-border growth rate. We're seeing some slowdown in the payment volume growth rate. But overall, it will be a decent year of growth in Europe, though not as high as we are seeing in other parts of the world or in the U.S. So that's Europe growth. In terms of yields, yes, yields are assumed to improve. Some of that we anticipate will happen from some of the actions we are in the process of implementing, like what we told you. The elimination of rebates and the replacement with client incentives and some other actions we're doing. So you will see yields improve. But as we look ahead, Visa Europe will be an integral part of Visa, and you will start to see the impact of Visa Europe in the aggregate numbers we report and what happens to our yields from the new baseline you have in yields and so on. So hopefully that helps. We tried to give you as much detail as we can on what the current trend is, and it will help you figure out what Europe is contributing as you look ahead.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Best wishes to you, Charlie. I was wondering if you can maybe just frame, besides all the details, at the highest level, when you think about the guidance for 2017 that you offered, when you think about that versus last year, whether you think it's more or less conservative than last year in terms of your overall approach. And can you maybe talk about what's the biggest factor about Visa Europe outside of the consumer trends that could drive that either to the positive or negative side, whether it be client renewals or anything else?\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: I'll do the first, and I'll let Vasant do the second. I think you should expect that the answer from us to be that in both years, we try and be as accurate as we can. And obviously, there's a tremendous amount of assumptions that go into this. And I've said this time and time again, which is you all put all this weight on what we're telling you 2017 will be. And what we try and make clear is there's a series of things that we know and there's a series of things we don't know. And the series of things we don't know \u2013 but where we're making assumptions, we try and lay those out for you. And quite frankly, you've got to make your own determination whether you think those are aggressive or conservative. But I'll tell you, it's certainly not in any of our bones and hasn't been in any part of Visa's bones since it went public to be on the aggressive side.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Just to reiterate what we're expecting, and again, I think we tried to give you as factual a point of view as we can. Our revenue growth if you adjust for the exchange rate drag, which perhaps you may not have anticipated without thinking about the hedging implications, and you might have seen the hedging implications in our second half results. Our currency impact essentially stayed flat through the year mostly because hedging helped in the first half and hurt a bit in the second half. And all it does really is delay the impact of the moves in the dollar. But if you adjust for the hedging impact, what you're seeing in high teens revenue growth \u2013 net revenue growth. And what you're seeing is mid-teens plus 1.5 to 2 points EPS growth. It's not that different than perhaps what you might have expected of us going into the year. Visa Europe is tracking as we expected. We feel very good about it. What could surprise one way or another, we laid out all the factors. Clearly, the cross-border trends are heartening. And hopefully, if the dollar stays on this track, which is either stable or further weakening, that would be good for us. I think currency forwards are now expecting more of a flattening of the dollar, which is what we've assumed. In terms of the currency volatility front, that's a little bit of anybody's guess. We did tell you sort of what we're assuming. But overall, I mean, if there is going to be anything on the plus or minus side, we have assumed that the European trends have softened through the year, and we've assumed that those trends will continue into next year. Hopefully European economies will do better than that, and if that does, that'll be great.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Just maybe on the incentives, obviously, they're going up a decent amount. Is some of it because you've had better success than you thought in re-signing some of these banks? And maybe, Vasant, you can just talk about how we should consider the trajectory after 2017, given this backdrop? Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: I think we'll talk more about all that as we get into the latter part of 2017 when we talk about 2018. But trajectory-wise, I wouldn't assume significant changes. Visa Europe is now part of the numbers, and that explains, as we told you earlier, about half the delta. And there's also this impact we get when we pull back the rebates. It has the effect of raising gross revenues and incentives at the same time. So Visa Europe lands up at a place where their incentives as a percent of gross revenues are certainly driving the new level. Beyond that, yes, we have Costco coming in for a full year. That certainly adds to it. And we had some significant renewals, in particular, Asian geographies. So this \u2013 you should assume that this is a level that is about where we should see it stay, but we'll update you as we get through this year.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: This may be more of a housekeeping question, Vasant, but historically, looking at page 13 from the third quarter slides, you used to give constant dollar growth and then adjust for the foreign exchange. Now you're giving a nominal dollar growth and then calling out the foreign exchange. I'm just wondering what \u2013 philosophically is the adjustment, because that's kind of an important change in the messaging.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: I think you're reading too much into it. I think as a general rule, we've gone through all our releases and we try to lead with what is the GAAP number and follow with what's the adjusted number. So you've seen us do that almost everywhere, and you should not read too much into it really. And also, the currency impact certainly is moderating, but I wouldn't say that's the reason why it follows rather than leads. It has more to do with wanting to lead with GAAP numbers wherever we can.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just on the quarter, you guys had said that the results were better than expected. Just not exactly clear what drove the better-than-expected results; if you could maybe highlight some things that drove better than what you guys anticipated? And then on Visa Europe, I know it was 13 points to 14 points of contribution to revenue in the fourth quarter, at least that was the guidance. I'm just not sure or clear what that contribution will be for fiscal year 2017 in that same manner. Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: In the fourth quarter, I would say on the margin, revenue was a little better, but expenses were better and the tax rate was a little bit better. So in aggregate, it was a little better than we expected. As far as next year goes \u2013 and now Visa Europe is an integral part of our business. We tend not to \u2013 we do not separate out our regions. So you would \u2013 so we would report everything on an aggregated basis and not separate out Visa Europe. It becomes more and more integrated in, and \u2013 it's best to sort of look at it on an aggregate basis. But we've given you enough so that you will get a good sense of what Visa Europe contributed, and as you model next year, I think it will give you a good sense of what Visa Europe will contribute to next year.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tom McCrohan from CLSA. Your line is now open.\nThomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC: Hi, thank you. Can you just give us the progress of the number of the Visa European banks that you still need to finalize in terms of moving into an incentive structure? Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: It's an active process. It's well underway. We're happy with the progress. There's a well-choreographed process, which talks to a large number of issuers. So I don't know if there's much more than that we would say at this point.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Hi, thanks. Wow, it sounds like China is trailing expectations in terms of when you can get up and running. Could you comment on Mexico and when you think Mexico could be accretive to numbers? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: Let me just start with China for a second. I've said this, I think, over and over and over again. And so this will be the last chance I'll get to say it, which is China is a very important opportunity for us. It's something that we spend a lot of time on and we take very seriously. But it's a long-term opportunity. And long-term is not measured in months or even single-digits numbers of years. So the work and our thought process that we have going on with China does not demand that we're allowed market entry at any specific date. We've said we're committed for the long-term. We don't expect it to be a meaningfully different contributor to the revenue growth or the profits of the company in the shorter period of time because there's a lot that's out of our control. And so as we sit here today, as we think about our forecasting over the next bunch of years, we don't rely on China when we think about the opportunities for us to continue to grow the company. At some point, we do believe that they will pan out but, again, that's a longer-term opportunity rather than a shorter-term opportunity.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: There's really not much to say about Mexico. I mean that is an ongoing discussion we're having. And over time, if there are new developments...\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: I'm not sure what the question is on Mexico.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: I presume about processing transactions.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Yeah.\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: Yeah. So that one's client-by-client, and we have some good discussions going on where it's up to us to talk about the benefits that clients get when we process transactions. And when there's something to talk about relative to movement in the marketplace, I'm sure Vasant, you'll do it.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nJason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. So just on cross-border, it was great to see us get back to double-digit growth organic. And I know there's a bunch of moving parts for fiscal 2017 in that regard. But are you expecting double-digit growth to continue through 2017 as part of your guidance? And then just a quick housekeeping separate from that. Can you tell us what percent of your European volumes are from UK?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: What percent of our European volumes are from the UK? Yeah. If I remember right, I think it was \u2013 from a revenue standpoint, we've told you that revenues from the UK were a little above 10%. So that gives you a rough idea. In terms of our cross-border business, what we saw in the fourth quarter, as we mentioned, was a nice recovery in the U.S. acquired business. We also saw quite a bit of growth in the acquired business in the UK from the weakness of the pound. We saw improvement in the acquired business in places like Mexico mostly benefiting from the U.S. Those are some of the big growth spots. The good news, though, was from an issuing standpoint, we saw growth in a lot of places. We saw growth coming out of Brazil, out of Russia, out of many of the commodity and oil-based economies, Middle East and parts of Asia also improving and China beginning to stabilize. So our expectation going forward is not for a significant change from these trends. You should assume we're hoping that these trends stay roughly about the same.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Glenn? If you're talking, you're on mute. Glenn?\nGlenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey guys, can you hear me?\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: Yes, Glenn. There we go.\nGlenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, sorry about that. A couple of number clarifications, maybe for Vasant. The first one, could you give us what the constant currency volume growth in Europe was? And then of the \u2013 the question would be also of the percentage of European transactions that are processed, meaning included in the Visa process transactions. And then, if I heard right, I just want to clarify that you're expecting mid-teen decline in Europe volume because of the co-badging issue?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Let me talk a little bit about that. I believe the \u2013 I think we reported this. I think we had most people report their co-badge volumes in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter number ended up being relatively untainted by lack of reporting, and I think the payment volumes, if I remember right, were somewhere in the 6% range. So as you can see, they are lower than what we see in other parts of the world, in terms of growth rates. As you look at next year, the issue on co-badge volumes is that there are a certain number of issuers that have co-badge cards with us who are no longer required to report their co-badge volumes and transactions we do not process. The biggest impact is in France, and there's some impact in some Scandinavian countries. If they don't all report, which is what we expect, we expect that they will all not report, then payment volumes will decline next year, we said as much as 15% to 20%. So remember, I mean, if it's plus 6% and minus 20%, that's a delta of almost 25% or 26%. Plus, as you know in the first three quarters, Visa Europe payment volumes will show up as all incremental to our payment volume and will have this impact on it. So you will see a fair amount of distortion in payment volume reporting as a result of this. Now, the lack of payment volume reporting and its revenue impacts we've factored into our outlook. So that is all factored into what we told you our revenue picture is next year. But the payment volumes will look odd. Although we report by region, so at least you'll be able to see what it is by region and be able to look at how everybody else is doing, and Europe will just look odd.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, Laura.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nLisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, Charlie. As you're closing out your tenure with Visa, unfortunately for all of us, could you just do a brief kind of look back over some of the major pieces of Visa's strategy over your tenure? Particularly around the merchant side, just putting that in context of your announcement around the Visa Ad Measurement capabilities. And then also on the B2B side with the call-outs related to Visa Direct, and then the recent announcement with Chain around B2B Connect, and just how you see the progress in some of those major pieces of your strategy over the last couple of years?\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: Listen, first of all, I think \u2013 and I really do believe this, which is it's \u2013 and I said this when we did the call last week, which is, I mean you all know as well as I do that companies like this are not dependent on any one person, right? There are 13,000 other people here that are going to continue doing what they've done the day after I go, and with a leader like Al [Kelly], I would assume, will do it as well, if not better. And so as we think about what we've done over the past four years, or even what this company has done since it's gone public, it's based upon what an entire management team has done. I think that what I feel very good about when I think about the things that we've done, I think you brought up the work on \u2013 that we have really \u2013 I would describe as, we've really begun to do with merchants is an important part of the way we think about what we do. We are not trying to do work for merchants in lieu of any other client or any other partner, but just recognizing that everyone participates in the payments value chain should get access to the capabilities that we have. And so someone asked me last week if I were them, how would they evaluate how we're doing at making progress with merchants, and my answer was, I would look to see that we're continuing quarter after quarter, year after year, to introduce solutions in the marketplace, which help merchants grow their business, and then try and derive some kind of understanding of what the adoption looks like for those products. And don't be confused by the couple of merchants that are always going to be unhappy, that are always going to be doing things in the marketplace. The merchant world is very fragmented across the world. We've got some very, very strong relationships, and we've got a bunch of relationships where those merchants are sitting there very eager to work with us on the solutions that we're developing. And then I think just not because I don't want to take up the whole call with the question, I do think just when I think about the way we thought about innovation here and the way we thought about our work in digital commerce, I think the whole organization has just made tremendous progress. We don't talk about \u2013 let me say it differently. We don't use the word innovation around here anymore because it becomes part of the way people think about doing their business. We're rooted in supporting our client base and supporting the four-party model, but we are very focused on being as successful and having our clients be successful in the digital world. And whether it's the work of the Dev Center, the APIs that we've made available, all of the things that we've done that position us well in the world of digital commerce, including Visa Checkout, those are all part of those things. So everything we do is about continuing to be strong in the physical world but recognizing that we needed to think very differently in the digital world. There's a tremendous amount more to do, so I don't want to \u2013 and I don't think about this as if we've done it and it's time for me to move on. I think we've done an awful lot. But I'm confident that those activities and the way people think is the way the organization thinks.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Thank you. Next question, Laura.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Just a quick follow-up on incentives. I know you ran at about 18.9% in Q4, guidance around 21% at the midpoint. I guess I thought you already included \u2013 you were at a run rate of including Costco and USAA incentives already along with Visa Europe. The vast majority of it was already kind of the run rate in the past quarter. And then quickly on expenses, you're saying mid-single digit growth. I know you just did \u2013 again, you did low single digit growth in the year. You seem to have been able to accomplish all your investment needs under that rate. I guess if you could, just explain why we need to reaccelerate. Thanks, guys.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: I think mid-single digits has been our historic. And by the way, that's the expense growth for let's call it core Visa ex-Europe, the expense base you've been used to looking at. And if you look at the history, we have typically run mid-single digits. We are continuing to invest in all the programs we want to invest in. What we did this year was to prioritize around all the other things. As you look at next year, the run rate returns to what has been more of a long-term trend. The level of investment remains as steady as it has been, and we'll continue to drive productivity. Some of the charge we took is a reflection of that. So that was in terms of the expense growth rate. So it really is a return back to what has been a very long-term trend, into level of investment we need to keep the business focused on all the right things. The other part of the question I may have forgotten, on the other one.\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: Incentives.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: On incentives, we didn't have the impact of Visa Europe in the fourth quarter to the extent that you have it next year because in the fourth quarter, the rebates were still in place. We eliminated the rebates only as of the end of September. And then also quarter-by-quarter impacts, Visa Europe brand are relatively higher level of incentives in the first half of the year, somewhat lower in the second half if you look to the filings we had done. So the full impact of Europe was really not as visible in the fourth quarter because the rebates to client incentive shift was not in place in the fourth quarter. Costco, we had some of their incentives in this year, but clearly it's a full year of Costco, so you see the full impact. Plus, there's a whole bunch of renewals that I talked about that really start flowing into next year, mostly the ones we did in Asia. So it's all these all together.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. I appreciate taking the call, Charlie. It's been a pleasure. A big picture question, you've touched on it recently with your blockchain B2B announcement, but this is a big market. Your primary competitor has made a pretty aggressive move into B2B and hedged that maybe a little bit with the VocaLink acquisition. I wonder if you can just think about the way that market evolves in your mind, ACH versus cards and what the tradeoffs might be and what the opportunity is for Visa.\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: Sure. Listen, I think what's important is that there is this \u2013 and I'll describe it as really a government sponsored, whether it's official or not, push towards faster payments. And so when I think about ACH and we think about what's going on, I think that is the predominant driver because certainly the ACH system here and others around the world haven't been able to provide the same kind of level of service as you get from other products or other networks. And so when we think about what it means for us, we know the capabilities that we have. When we think about what we've done and the way we've positioned ourselves with Visa Direct and getting access on a push payments basis to 3 billion cards across the world, we feel really good about the position that we have with those capabilities. It doesn't mean that that's all we're thinking about and all that we're doing, and you've seen us do some work, as you mentioned, in the blockchain space, thinking more about, where are payments inefficient. And for what we do in our traditional consumer-to-business world, that's not a problem that needs to get solved today in terms of what blockchain can do. But certainly in the commercial space, it's a very, very inefficient market, and there are opportunities to use different technologies to bring some efficiency there. So the things that we're doing, they are around doing things to improve something that exists and for the core business of what we do today between consumers and merchants \u2013 and it will be through consumers-to-consumers in terms of using our push payment capabilities, it's leveraging the core assets that we have that work really well that have access to these 3 billion cards across the world.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, Laura?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Vasant, I just wanted to look one more time at the incentive as a percent of gross revenue. In the past few years, Visa has given us this range as basically with 100 basis points just like you've done today. I'm just trying to make sure that I understand. Does this reflect that there's confidence there? And what are the swing factors in that range between 20.5% and 21.5%? Is it mostly Europe, or do you have a lot of puts and takes in renewals?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: No. As always, you give a range because there are some things you know. The things you know are the deals that have already been done and what their impact might be based on the assumptions you're making on the revenue side, and as the revenues play out as you expect, then you get the incentives coming in as you expect. The variability comes from things that are potential renewals during the year or things you have to do along the way because something happens that you didn't expect. So those would be the things that take you to one end of the range or the other.\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: And also to keep in mind \u2013 our incentive deals aren't generally structured as a percentage of gross revenues. Every deal is structured differently. Sometimes they're tiers, sometimes things are based on volumes. They're based on lots of different things. So we make a bunch of assumptions as to what we think will play out by client in a year, and it doesn't always play out that way by client. So a range really is the right way to think about it. And I just think the continued 100 basis point range is because we know a bunch of it has been signed, and it's just a question of how those bonds play out. But we do, as Vasant said, will sign some new deals throughout the year that will impact those numbers, and we make assumptions on what that looks like.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: And as we've said before, there's a lot of focus on incentives and trying to predict them from one quarter to another. And in the end, what really counts is net revenue. Net revenue is what we essentially keep and take to the bank, and it's net revenue growth that counts. And there's always going to be some noise in the trade-off between gross revenues and incentives, and there could be shifts from one quarter to another depending on when renewals happen. The number to focus on is net revenues, and we would keep saying that.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, Laura?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes, Vasant. Now that you have closed on Visa Europe, I was just curious on your confidence level for the consolidation of the processing systems and if there's any kind of scenario where that could happen a little bit earlier and drive some earlier acceleration at the synergies?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Yeah. So far we feel very good about everything \u2013 and Charlie might want to add some more things, but we feel very good about how the integration is proceeding. So really no surprises on that front and good progress and pretty much have achieved all the things we wanted to achieve at this stage of the game. The technology integration is also off to a good start. As we told you, that is a multiyear integration. It's too early to tell you that it will be finished sooner, but our goal is to get it done as fast as we can. The gating variable there is to minimize any impact on clients, so we will pace it to ensure that the \u2013 this is as easy for clients as we can make it. So we won't rush it if it has \u2013 if it's going to have a negative impact on clients. So that will be the biggest gating variable in the end. I don't know, Charlie, if you want to add...?\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: The one thing I would add is I think, I mean, I personally have enormous confidence in the work that the technology teams on both sides of the Atlantic are doing. We know how to do these integrations. And remember, what these integrations are is, I mean, this is really in many cases what we're doing is we're taking the systems that we have at VI. We're looking at what capabilities need to be built into our systems to accommodate Europe's clients, and building them out, just as we always do on an ongoing basis, into the VI systems and do it in a way where everything works as anticipated. So we \u2013 I mean, our team is extraordinarily professional. And I personally just \u2013 I think \u2013 I just have every level of confidence that they'll do that well. And to the timing question, I think this is one where \u2013 someone asked the question about \u2013 before about on guidance aggressive or conservative. I think this is one \u2013 we've been very clear about this, which is we could do this quicker. It's not a question of us doing the work to build out those additional capabilities. That will be done relatively quickly. The real question is what's the appropriate pace to complete these conversions along with our clients. And what we've said is that we don't intend to rush that. This is the type of thing that we have to do in a way that fits in with things that work for clients, and I think that's just a smart way. I think you would want us to think about it that way. We'll get plenty of benefits in the next couple of years from Europe and there will be plenty more beyond that that we should do this the right way.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: With that, Laura, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question is from Chris Brendler from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in, and best of luck, Charlie. We're sorry to see you go. I just wanted to ask a question on EMV. Now that we're a little over a year in, do you feel like it's been a little bit of a messy process in some ways, but do you feel like we've gotten to a point where EMV is gaining traction? And if you can add any color commentary on the rule changes relative to chargebacks and the $25 limit and how much that's improved the merchant experience with EMV, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: Listen, I don't have a lot more to say from what we've said on EMV. I meant to just give you the update on the numbers in terms of almost 65% of the credit cards and 45% of the debit cards, 1.6 million merchants, which is about 40%, are accepting them. I think it's a lot of work, for sure. It's progressing along a timeframe which is faster than we've seen in any other part of the world when they have moved from mag stripe to chip. We've said this I think last quarter or the quarter before. Today it's the largest chip card market in the world, even though we still have a long way to go. And you see the meaningful impacts on the reduction in fraud when chip-on-chip exists. So there's no question that as difficult as it is that it's the right thing to do. And it will just take a period of time as these tails continue to complete the conversions. And while we continue to complete the EMV rollouts in the U.S., I can assure you that we are working really diligently, as are \u2013 well, let's say we're doing this in partnership with everyone including acquirers, issuers, merchants, everyone in the ecosystem just to think through what's next, which is certainly looking at the online world but also continuing to look at encryption and new ways of authentication in the physical world.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: And with that, we want to thank you all for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to call Investor Relations.\nCharles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference.

And finally, for historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and any other information required by Regulation G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you very much, Jack, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time. There are a series of topics that I'm going to discuss today. I'll talk a little bit about third quarter results, a few comments about our European acquisition, and talk about litigation. I'm going to make some comments about the agreement we signed with PayPal today. I have a series of business updates that I'm going to walk through and then just a few sentences on the future before I turn it over to Vasant. First of all, with the closing of our Visa Europe acquisition, as you can see if you look through the numbers, the quarter is somewhat complicated, but we tried to be as clear as we can in explaining the results. I want to start by saying that we're pleased with our continued consistent and predictable results in the face of an unchanged economic environment and increased geopolitical risks. To that point, the consumer has remained remarkably steadfast in the face of significant global instability. Getting on to the results, we reported GAAP EPS of $0.17 per share and adjusted EPS of $0.69 per share. This includes several special items related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Vasant will discuss in further detail, but we view these as non-recurring items and are not a reflection of business performance. On an adjusted basis, net operating revenue grew 3% nominally or 6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a continued negative three percentage point impact from FX and in line with expectations we discussed last quarter. Our growth continues to be subdued by similar themes we have previously spoken about, such as the strength of the U.S. dollar on translation and cross-border volumes, continued low oil prices, and weakness in China and oil-based economies. However, U.S. spend remained steady, as does other domestic spend. Overall, payments volume, cross-border volume growth, and processed transaction growth was similar to last quarter. The following numbers do not include Europe. U.S. payments volume growth was 10%, basically unchanged from last quarter after adjusting for leap year. International payments volume growth was 11%, down from 14% last quarter, driven almost entirely by lower domestic transactions in China that yield very little revenue. Cross-border volume growth was 5%, unchanged. Processed transaction growth was 10%, an acceleration of one point due to lapping of Russian's NSPK migration. More recently, though, through July 14, U.S. payment volume growth was 11%. U.S. credit grew 18%, driven almost entirely by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. Debit growth, on the other hand, moderated considerably, falling from 8% in fiscal Q3 to 3% through July 14. The decline was driven primarily by Interlink. About a third of the decline is due to the lapping of very high growth at one of our large issuers who added Interlink to their cards last year, and the remainder is due to dynamic routing decisions. The decline due to the lapping will continue for another three quarters while the remainder is volatile, as merchants and acquirers make routing decisions dynamically. Cross-border growth through July 14 is up 156%, but that's inclusive of Europe in the July 14 period. For comparability, if you include Europe in both periods, through July 14 growth is 12% versus 8% in the third quarter. The increase is driven by the timing of Ramadan and improvements that we see in the U.S. and Asia. And processed transactions rose 42% including Europe. If you include Europe in both periods, then processed transactions are flat at 11%. Moving on to Europe, just a couple of comments, we're very happy to have closed the acquisition on June 21. We are well into the integration process. We have a management team in place which provides a great deal of consistency. We've developed an integrated management approach, and the teams are working extremely well together. We hosted 500 clients the week after the close in Europe, where we showcased the benefits of a combined Visa to those clients. We've implemented an integrated approach to global and multi-region clients. And we're working through product and digital roadmaps, ensuring Europe is appropriately prioritized within Visa. Regarding Brexit, just let me make a couple of comments. First of all, with Brexit or without Brexit, it does not change our long-term view that the strategic rationale for putting these two companies together makes extraordinary sense. Also, I want to remind people that they had a put. And in that scenario, a negotiated transaction is a far better approach than having someone exercise a put at a time which is out of your control. Certainly in the short term, currency weakness and reduced economic growth are factors. We haven't seen much impact yet, but time will tell. We still feel good about our ability to deliver the accretion that we discussed, and Vasant will review that in more detail in his comments. Let me quickly touch on legal matters now. The recent decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse the approval of our multi-district litigation class settlement is certainly disappointing. These cases were originally filed in 2005, and we continue to believe that the settlement was fair and reasonable for all stakeholders. However, the Appeals Court found that there were conflicts of interest between the two merchant settlement classes, a class that would have received money for alleged past damages and a class that would receive the benefit of certain changes to our network rules going forward. The court concluded that the conflict of interest between these classes meant that the classes were inadequately represented for purposes of settlement. It will take some time for the impact of this ruling to be determined, and there may be further appeals. Meanwhile, Visa continues to honor the terms of the class settlement agreement, which remains in effect and did not terminate automatically because of the court's ruling. So for example, Visa has not reversed its rule change permitting U.S. merchants to surcharge credit transactions, and the funds that Visa paid pursuant to the class settlement remain in court supervised escrow accounts. If the Court of Appeals decision remains after any further appeals, the matter will resume in the lower federal court, where we will defend the case and in time likely make a renewed effort to settle with the merchant classes. It is too early to speculate what shape that might take. However, I note that the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan continues to provide protection against monetary claims in the class litigation. As you know, a number of merchants have opted out of the class and filed their own complaints, and are continuing to defend those claims which have not yet already been settled. The District Court has set a status conference on August 11, where we hope to obtain further clarity about next steps in both the class action and opt-out cases, but this will likely go on for some time. Finally, I should note that all the individual settlements we've entered into with opt-out merchants remain in effect despite the court's ruling and regardless of the direction of any further appeals. The only exception is our settlement with Walmart, which was contingent upon the class settlement being affirmed. Its status will be determined after we have a final non-appealable decision in the class settlement. Let me move on and talk about PayPal now. Earlier, we announced a new strategic partnership with PayPal. The partnership will result in significantly improved payment experiences for Visa cardholders in the PayPal and Venmo wallets. The partnership is designed to deliver significant benefits for Visa's issuing financial institutions, including a significantly better experience for their customers, more spending volume on their credit and debit cards, lower operational costs, and improved security. Merchants will also benefit from improved customer experiences, efficiency, and security, which together should help drive increased sales. The details include the following. First of all, enhanced consumer choice and improved experience for Visa cardholders. PayPal will make it easier for new and existing customers to choose to pay with their Visa cards and ensure a more seamless experience. Visa cards will be presented as a clear and equal payment option during enrollment and subsequent payments, with an easy ability for consumers to set as their preferred payment method. Visa digital card images will be incorporated into payment flows. PayPal will not encourage Visa cardholders to link to a bank account via ACH. PayPal will also support and work with issuers to identify consumers who choose to migrate existing ACH payment flows to their Visa cards. Consumers will also be able to instantly withdraw and move money from their PayPal and Venmo accounts to their bank account via their Visa debit cards, leveraging Visa Direct, providing experience that offers speed, security, and convenience. An important aspect of our agreement is enhanced data quality. PayPal will ensure that the data provided to issuers and their cardholders for Visa-funded transactions will be consistent with the information that is received with traditional Visa card transactions. This will ensure better consumer experience, reduced cardholder confusion, ensure proper application of rewards, and reduce costly and time-consuming disputes. PayPal will join the Visa Digital Enablement Program, what we refer to as VDEP, to enable them to expand their point-of-sale acceptance. This is a commercial framework for Visa partners to access our Token Services and other digital capabilities in the United States. Consistent with VDEP, issuers will be able to choose whether to participate or not. The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty. Importantly, Visa issuers will have a 12-month period of exclusivity for promoting their cards that are within PayPal's wallets. The partnership puts PayPal and Visa on a new constructive path forward and provides a framework for our companies to work together collaboratively. A couple of notes about some client activity. We're pleased to announce that we renewed a multiyear agreement with TD in the United States and Canada for continued Visa credit and debit issuance. Regions Bank, a long-time Visa client, renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement. Chevron, one of the world's leading energy companies, renewed a multiyear credit co-brand with Visa. And as I'm sure you know, on June 20 Visa credit cards became exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations, and the new Costco Anywhere Visa card by Citi launched. This has been a long, complex process, but we're very encouraged by the results so far. And outside of North America, Homeplus, the second largest retailer in South Korea with branch and home delivery services, renewed a multiyear co-brand program across multiple issuers supporting payWave. In Taiwan, we renewed a multiyear credit co-brand agreement with Taichung Bank, one of the largest co-brand programs in the market. And in Indonesia, we renewed a multiyear debit agreement with Mandiri, who is the largest state-owned bank in the country. Moving on to EMV in the U.S., nine months out from the official kickoff to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving from mag stripe to chip, and the U.S. is now the largest chip market in the world. More than 326 million Visa chip cards were issued as of June 2016, making the U.S., as I said, the largest in the world and larger than the UK and Brazil combined. 58% of credit cards and 37% of debit cards have a chip on them today. More than 1.3 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals, or roughly 28% of all merchant locations. Based on client surveys, we expect 75% of credit cards, 55% of debit cards, representing 96% and 73% of volume respectively, and roughly 45% to 50% of merchant locations will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar 2016. Having said all of this, this is a huge effort, and we're doing a series of things to help make this process move more quickly and more smoothly. To that end, Visa announced a series of initiatives to help accelerate EMV chip migration for merchants. We streamlined our testing requirements. We amended and simplified the terminal certification process. We committed to investing further resources and technical expertise in a manner that can reduce timeframes by as much as 50%. We are also making policy changes to help limit exposure to counterfeit fraud liability for merchants who are not yet chip-ready. I want to say a few things about our relationship with U.S. merchants. We continue to invest in people, products, and solutions to help our merchant clients grow their business and reduce their costs. We've made good progress on this front with many of our merchant clients, though it's early days and this a long-term commitment on our part. You have read surely about some of the disputes we have with some merchants. We are committed to doing everything reasonable to resolve these issues, and we're committed to continue strengthening our relationship with all merchants. As we continue to expand Visa Checkout around the world, we're constantly working to perfect the user experience and to deliver on our promise to make paying with Visa in the digital world as easy as it's been to pay in the physical world for more than 50 years. We've rolled out the new Visa Checkout experience to all of our merchants globally. Working with dozens of our top U.S. merchants, we updated the Checkout experience to simplify the signup process for consumers to enroll, add cards, and manage their information with more fluid interactions and smart autofill capabilities. We also have begun to roll out an interactive Checkout button, allowing customers to enter their password right into the Checkout button and confirm Checkout with a single tap. Most of these features will be automatically available, which means merchants do not have to make any adjustments to their existing online Checkout processes or payment systems. As we head into the Rio Olympics, we used the global sponsorship platform to highlight Visa Checkout and its merchants, including Best Buy and United Airlines, with whom we've created Olympic-themed ads that you'll likely see on TV in the U.S. in the coming weeks. As we continue to look forward and drive new technologies in the payments space, as you know, we opened an innovation center in our San Francisco headquarters, which has served as a destination for clients, partners, and developers to see our new payments technologies and work alongside us and our experts and jointly create the next generation of payment and commerce applications. We've had great success and we've committed to expand the number of facilities so we can be closer to our clients. To that end, in April we opened our Singapore innovation center. In May we opened one in Dubai and in June we opened one in Miami, all of which will serve our clients, partners, and developers in that region and act as a hub to jointly create the next generation of payment commerce applications. Accessible to both local and global clients, all these innovation centers will provide our partners with access to Visa APIs and software development kits available through our Visa developer platform. We also have an innovation center in London and have plans to open others in 2017. We announced yesterday that we'll be opening a new facility in Palo Alto later this year. The office will house work that we do around data, business intelligence, technology research, and merchant solutions. We decided to open this facility following on the great success that we've seen with our San Francisco and Bangalore facilities. We've found that the combination of location, physical design, and co-worker collocation concentration are critical in our quest to continue to lead and innovate. All of these new locations provide opportunities to draw talent from communities that have concentrations of skills different from each other and allows Visa to benefit from the diversity of people and ideas in these very different communities. We announced a new $5 billion share repurchase program. This brings the total available for share repurchases to $7.3 billion. This a reflection of our confidence in our business, our commitment to offset the dilution from the preferred stock issued to Visa Europe members, and our continuing commitment to return excess capital to shareholders. Before I turn the call over to the Vasant, just a few words about the future; you can see that we provided full-year guidance on a GAAP and an adjusted GAAP basis as required, and we've tried to give you a clear indication of the impact of Europe in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis and without the impact of Europe, we reaffirmed all of our 2016 guidance metrics. You will hear from Vasant, but we're still confident in our ability to achieve the accretion from the European transaction we shared at the time of the announcement. Looking ahead, we expect next quarter's results to improve modestly, similar to first half of the year's results. We'll provide more commentary on 2017 in October, but our underlying business is strong. And with the lapping effect of several items based on what we know today and assuming similar consumer spending partners, we feel good about our ability to produce stronger revenue and earnings growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Charlie. In a world that's turbulent both from a macroeconomic and a geopolitical standpoint, our business remained steady and resilient. A few points to note, net revenue grew 6% in constant dollars and 3% in nominal dollars, at the high end of the range we had given you. Key business trends, payment volumes, processed transactions, and cross-border transactions remained stable. Currency volatility stayed high, especially post the Brexit vote. As expected, client incentives are almost 19% of gross revenue. Once again, we had good expense management. Expenses declined 7% in the quarter on an adjusted basis and are flat year to date versus 2015. Lower personnel and marketing costs contributed to lower than projected expenses in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.69 after you adjust for our GAAP EPS of $0.17 for four significant Visa Europe related non-recurring items: first, a $1.9 billion loss related to the settlement of the Visa Europe framework agreement as part of our acquisition of Visa Europe; second, a $92 million stamp duty paid to the UK treasury, recorded in general and administrative expenses; third, $60 million in transaction-related expenses recorded in professional fees; fourth, a net gain of $103 million, as we accumulated euros leading up to the closing of the transaction, which is recorded in non-operating income. You might recall we had a similar gain of $116 million last quarter, which we also excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment. Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers, global payments volume in constant dollars grew 10%, roughly in line with the prior quarter when you adjust for the leap day. U.S. payments volume picked up modestly adjusted for the leap day, as we start to benefit from the USAA and Costco conversions, which helped credit growth to exceed debit growth in the U.S. International payment volume growth of 11% ticked down modestly. The strong dollar continued to weigh on international payment volumes. Nominal growth was 5%. Despite Brexit, an oil price collapse, commodity market weakness, the slowdown in China, terrorism and other destabilizing forces, payment volumes have remained stable for most of this year. Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars, a modest step up from a leap day-adjusted second quarter. As the strengthening trend in the dollar has moderated, we have seen a reduction in the rate of decline in our large U.S. acquired business and in outbound commerce from Canada. However, this improvement is largely offset by a continuing slowdown of outbound commerce from China, down from 50% growth rates in Q3 last year to barely positive right now. Cross-border commerce from oil and commodity-based economies remain sluggish. Processed transactions totaled $19.8 billion in the quarter, up 10%. U.S. growth was 11% and international growth was 7%. As expected, international processed transaction growth rates are stepping up as we lap the transfer of domestic processing to NSPK in Russia. As you know, these numbers are not inclusive of Visa Europe. In our operational package this quarter, we have included a schedule that provides you with a five-quarter history of the European geographies payment volume and transaction statistics. If we add these to our Q3 metrics both to this year and last, constant dollar global payment volume growth would be 9%. Cross-border volume constant growth calculated based on merchant country currencies would be 8%, and processed transaction growth would be 11%. Of course, starting next quarter, we will incorporate Europe as a new region in our operational performance data package. Moving on to our financial metrics, service revenue grew 6%, roughly in line with nominal payments volume growth. The reduction in the growth rate from the last quarter was anticipated as we lapped pricing increases from last year. Data processing revenue grew 10%, in line with processed transaction growth. International revenues grew 4%, generally in line with volume growth, as we lap our price increases and the drag of the strong dollar moderates. Fortunately, currently volatility stayed high and comparable to the highs reached last year. Post the Brexit vote, volatility reached levels we have not experienced in recent years. Incentives were in line with our expectations. As we indicated, the significant year-over-year increase was driven by an unusually low level of incentives in the third quarter of 2015. Incentives as a percentage of gross revenues approached 19% and will tick up further in Q4 as Costco incentives kick in. This will bring full-year client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to around 18.5%, at the high end of the 17.5% to 18.5% range that we had provided you. With expense growth down 7% and a tax rate of 30.4%, our run rate EPS was $0.69 after making the four Visa Europe-related adjustments I described. As a reminder, there is no Visa Europe revenue, expense, or income in our Q3 numbers. Had we included Visa Europe results for the nine days we owned it in the quarter, it would have added a de minimis $12 million to our net income. Some Visa Europe-related considerations, the European leadership team is in place, as Charlie said, and running the business. The business is performing as expected and integration activities have commenced. The employee consultation process, which is required by law before any restructuring of operations, is underway in the UK. The technology harmonization program has also been launched. We are moving fast to bring Visa's global capabilities to European customers, including Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Direct, as well as our consulting resources. Significant customer relationships have already been renewed and others are in process. We believe our customers are excited by what a global Visa can offer them. Visa Europe members have been informed that rebates will terminated at the end of September 2016. We are working with our customers to transition to commercial relationships with competitive client incentive programs, as we have elsewhere in the world. This will be a multiyear process, but the early results have been positive. The longer-term impact of Brexit on Visa Europe's business is too early to determine. The immediate impact has been on exchange rates. The weaker pound and euro will hurt revenues as reported in dollars. However, a significant portion of Visa Europe's expenses are currently denominated in pounds, which offsets the negative revenue impact. Given the relative value of the pound and the euro at this point, the net impact of Visa Europe earnings as reported in dollars is roughly neutral right now. Brexit has also introduced significant uncertainty, which is never good for business sentiment. Most economic prognosticators are expecting an economic slowdown in Europe. Beyond this, it is too early to know what the broader and longer-term implications of Brexit are for our business. Assuming exchange rates stay where they are today and there are no major economic dislocations as a result of Brexit, we expect Visa Europe earnings to offset interest expense from debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, as we told you last quarter. Visa Europe is expected to add 2% to 3% to EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017, in line with the low single-digit accretion we had anticipated. Our accretion estimate assumes the current tax structure stays in place through fiscal year 2017. Under this structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. taxpayer. This tax structure is favorable from a cash tax standpoint. However, the current tax structure results in a high reported or book tax rate for Visa Europe's earnings. This will add approximately one percentage point to Visa's reported tax rate in fiscal year 2017. As always, we will be working on plans to improve both our cash and reported tax rates over time. Visa Europe has over $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet. Based on discussions with our regulator in the UK, we will leave this cash within the Visa Europe legal entity. As a result of this action and due to the higher upfront cash consideration after we eliminated the earnout provision, we will issue additional debt later this year to fund stock buybacks to offset dilution from preferred stock issued in the transaction. Our current plan is to issue at least $2 billion in debt before the end of this calendar year. As we indicated, we plan to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred shares issued by buying stock in excess of our normal buyback program. We have been buying stock back at a stepped-up pace for the past two quarters in anticipation of the closing of the transaction. We plan to continue buying at this pace until we have bought back sufficient stock to offset the impact of the shares issued. We expect that we will be done by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. In the third quarter, we recognized a $1.9 billion loss related to the Visa Europe framework agreement. Under U.S. GAAP, as part of our accounting for the Visa Europe acquisition, we are required to assess all pre-existing contractual relationships between Visa Europe and Visa. If the terms of those agreements are determined to not be at fair value at the time of the close, a portion of the purchase price paid in the transaction is deemed to relate to the effective settlement of these arrangements between the parties. The Visa Europe framework agreement was established in October 2007 between Visa and Visa Europe as part of our 2007 reorganization. This agreement provides Visa Europe with a perpetual exclusive right to operate the Visa business in the European Union in exchange for a license fee paid to Visa. Under the terms of the framework agreement, the license fee paid by Visa Europe has increased modestly since 2007. However, the value of the Visa Europe business has increased at a greater rate. As such, management concluded that the terms of the framework agreement were not at fair value as determined under U.S. GAAP at the time of the close. We estimated the value of settling the framework agreement at $1.9 billion. The size of this settlement value was driven by the fact that the agreement was perpetual in nature and would have continued indefinitely had the acquisition not occurred. Under U.S. GAAP, $1.9 billion of total consideration transferred to VE in the transaction is immediately charged to the income statement as a one-time non-recurring operating expense representing the cost of settling this arrangement. Had this arrangement not existed or its terms been at fair value, this amount would have been allocated to net assets acquired. This would have resulted in $1.9 billion additional goodwill recorded in the transaction. Our third quarter balance sheet includes Visa Europe. In a few days we'll be filing our 10-Q, which will provide considerable detail on all aspects of the accounting for the Visa Europe transaction, allocation of the purchase price to net tangible assets and liabilities and to intangible assets and goodwill, as well as the impact of Visa Europe on cash and working capital balances. We would, of course, be happy to answer any questions you have after you review the 10-Q. Moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the impact of Visa Europe, we expect nominal net revenue growth in Q4 for the legacy Visa business, not including Visa Europe, of around 5% to 6%, in line with the first half trends. Q3 growth rates were depressed by unfavorable year-over-year comparisons on client incentives, which will normalize. We're also projecting a modest uptick in fourth quarter growth rates as dollar strength moderates and we lap the slowdown from last year. Visa Europe will add 13 to 14 points to fourth quarter net revenue growth. We expect 2% to 3% expense growth for legacy Visa in Q4 from Rio-related marketing and higher technology project spend. Visa Europe will add as much as 15 to 16 points to expense growth. As I mentioned earlier and in line with what we told you last quarter, Visa Europe income should offset debt interest expense in the fourth quarter. For the year, our key guidance metrics for legacy Visa remain largely unchanged. Visa Europe will add three to four points of growth to both revenue and expenses. The consultation process is underway in Europe. We're also looking at adjustments to our global cost base as we integrate Europe. Assuming our plans are finalized, we expect to take a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter to resize our global cost structure as a result of the Visa Europe acquisition. As we have said previously, the technology integration will happen later. We will regularly update you on progress. A quick word on fiscal year 2017. As we normally do, we will provide our comprehensive perspective on 2017 when we talk to you in late October. As we look ahead, we feel good about our business and what Visa Europe will add to it. There are, as always, tailwinds and headwinds. In the tailwinds column, payments volume uplift from USAA and Costco, two significant drags look likely to ease gas prices and the dollar translation impact, cross-border growth could improve as dollar strength moderates, and last but not least accretion from Visa Europe. In the headwinds column, continuing global uncertainty, both economic and geopolitical, the impact of Brexit on Europe, China slowdown, and market entry costs. On balance, we anticipate 2017 will be a year with healthy top and bottom line growth for Visa. With that, I'll turn this back to Jack.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, Vasant. Operator, at this time we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is from Mr. Tom McCrohan of CLSA. Your line is now open.\nThomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC: Hi. Thank you. A question on the PayPal agreements. One of the aspects of the agreement seems to be focused on having Visa being more of the default payment option, funding option on the PayPal account. So today what is Visa's share as the default funding option for PayPal accounts? Where do you believe this agreement is going to move that share? And what happens at the end of the 12-month period, exclusivity period, if Visa doesn't get the share that you expect it to get as a result of your negotiations? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me do a couple things, and Jack can chime in here too. Relative to what we make up of a PayPal wallet, you really have to ask PayPal that question because we know what we know and we have some general thoughts, but they really can be the ones and should be the ones. Generally, what we've always thought is that roughly half the transactions that run through PayPal run through a network, and we're roughly half or so of that, split between credit and debit, but I would call those gross approximations and directional, and you really need to talk to them. Relative to what happens in terms of the flows, again, if you go through what I said, what we really are interested in doing is to ensure that Visa cards are on a level playing field. And if they're on a level playing field, we feel great about our ability to increase the amount of volume that run over Visa cards and ultimately benefit our clients. And so what the agreement does is it enables that to occur, and there's a period of time where we will work actively together and exclusively to move volume from ACH back on to Visa cards if that's what the client wants to do. And so to the extent that that happens, net-net that's a financial plus for us. As part of this agreement, as we've said, there are incentives that we will pay, Visa incentives that we will pay to PayPal. And if those numbers aren't reached, then the incentives don't get paid. But the last thing I do want to say is partnership agreements work when there's alignment for everyone. And so we've had extensive conversations over a long period of time with PayPal, with our issuers, and other members of the payments community. And what we've tried to do here is to come up with something that really does work for everyone. And so where we could sit here and say this is all about driving growth in the electronic payments universe because we're creating better customer experiences, where they're allowed to use products that they want to use, where they get all the benefits of those products are and a seamless experience through PayPal, these products become a better alternative to cash and check and other alternatives out there. So the way we see it, we've given ourselves an opportunity to grow, we've given PayPal an opportunity to grow. And most importantly, we've given from our perspective at Visa our clients an ability and opportunity to grow and provide a better experience for their consumers.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Tom. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDavid Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks and congratulations on completing the Visa Europe acquisition. Now that you own Visa Europe, can you update us on your thoughts with respect to the pricing opportunity there to move Visa Europe's prices over time closer to MasterCard's, which are currently at a significant premium?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think there's much that we're going to add that we haven't said before on that. In the process of moving to a commercial enterprise, we obviously know what the market is. But we're also keenly aware that pricing should be reflective of the value that's added. And so I think that's a conversation that we'll have directly with our clients. And when it's appropriate, we'll talk more broadly about it.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nJason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks, guys, maybe just a quick clarification and then a question. Are you still expecting high single-digit EPS accretion from Visa Europe in fiscal 2020? And then my question just on the PayPal agreement, it looks like it's U.S.-only. Is there still something potentially in the works for non-U.S. as well?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So on PayPal, it is U.S.-only. And I think we're each in the position where we'd like to turn our attention outside the U.S., but we wanted to get the U.S. done first.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And on the Visa Europe accretion, no, there's no change in our expectations for the long-term.\nJason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC: Perfect, thank you.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Jason. Next question please, operator?\nOperator: Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Thanks for the update. I just want to go back to the timing you mentioned before around tailwinds. You mentioned a number of renewals also around large clients in your remarks. Incentives and rebates broadly were thought to be timed for the Costco and USAA deals I think early, followed by then revenue coming on in the next couple of quarters. So can you just provide us an update with the timing on those as the incentives are now flowing through, and should we get the revenue off that in the next few quarters? And then also, other types of incentives coming with those renewals, is there going to be any type of spike on that going forward? Thanks, guys.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I guess you were referring to the headwinds and tailwinds comments I had made. There was nothing there about renewals as it relates to next year. There is the normal course of renewals that we would do in the course of a year. In terms of incentives kicking in, as I mentioned, Costco incentives will definitely kick in meaningfully in the fourth quarter with a quarter lag. As you know, service revenues kick in a quarter later. You will see in our gross revenue an uptick in the rate of growth both from USAA and Costco, and of course there will be an uptick also on the incentive line. And the net of all that, we'll talk about all that as we talk more comprehensively about 2017. Other than that, I don't think there was anything else I said that you were talking about. That pretty much explains the comments on 2017.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. I just had a question on the PayPal-Visa agreement. The participation now in VDEP, I just want to be clear. That does now qualify them for a different interchange tier, which would be lower. And then the incentive fee that you're talking about, just so I'm clear, that's coming out of your \u2013 that would come out of your contra-revenue. And do we need to be contemplating that more significantly in 2017?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I just want to be \u2013 so VDEP, so just a couple things on VDEP. So what we've done is we have agreed with PayPal that they will have the ability to access Visa tokens. But in order to do that, they have to work with the financial institutions and they have to agree to provide those tokens. So what we've done is \u2013 think of it like we've enabled PayPal to have those discussions directly with the issuers, and that's up to the issuers to determine whether or not they would like to do that.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Katri of \u2013 let me check, of (43:40) Trading. Your line is now open.\nUnknown Speaker: Hey, thanks. Just going back to Visa Europe, your large competitor is talking about opportunities for them to gain some share in Europe. Maybe you can give us some color on any sort of potential churn that you're seeing in that business, and what are we doing to protect that down the road? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Listen, there are a lot of people that do a lot of talking out there, and that's fine. We spend a lot of time talking to our clients and working actively with them on delivering value day in and day out and letting the results speak for themselves. I would say that from the moment that we've announced the transaction, I think we're extremely, extremely comfortable with the renewal activity that's taken place in Europe. The team in Europe I would tell you has \u2013 our team in Europe has delivered everything that they've said they would deliver to us, and that has continued in the period after the close. Our conversations with clients I feel are exactly what we want them to be, which is they are very excited about having the opportunity to get access to the capabilities that the global Visa can bring, which Visa Europe was not able to bring. And so there are a lot of things that they liked about Visa Europe that encouraged them to do business with Visa Europe over a long period of time with those relationships, and we bring additional capabilities. And so I look at the environment and say listen, everywhere we compete across the world, you have to show up with better products day in and day out, and that's what we're able to do in Europe. And until I see anything different than what we've seen, I'm going to continue to feel great about where we are.\nUnknown Speaker: That's helpful, thanks.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Moshe. Next question, please, operator.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question on your comments around Interlink and dynamic routing. Can you just refresh our memory what to the extent the landscape has changed recently and what's causing the increased dynamic routing? My sense is there are some merchants who are using chip cards to take advantage of not just routing on PIN, but also routing on signature. And I wanted to see if you could potentially also discuss any legal aspects of the Kroger lawsuit as it relates to forcing consumers to choose PIN. Thank you.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not going to talk about anything regarding any ongoing litigation that we have, which I think is what you'd expect. But I'd say the following things. I think as we go through the conversion to EMV, there are a lot of moving pieces, especially in the debit world. With terminals having to be reprogrammed, new terminals out there, multiple applications embedded on chips and things like that, and merchants turning on PIN pads at different times from times when they've actually turned on the EMV reader. And so there's a lot of movement between signature and PIN, which is somewhat different than we would have seen in a steady-state environment, and that will play itself out. And that's not a plus or minus; there's just movement there. And that's just the reality of what happens during a conversion like this. What we see is ultimately we just want our consumers to have the ability to use the cards. Merchants have whatever abilities that Durbin has given them, and they've had those capabilities ever since Durbin was passed. And a big part of that is they have the ability to choose the routing preference. And so as we've seen since Durbin came into place, quarter by quarter there's just a whole series of things that impact where a merchant wants to route to. People give them incentives. Whose incentives they think they're going to hit or not hit help them decide where they want to route to and route away from. And so the Interlink volumes that we see, and we look at it regularly, are very volatile. And so just keep in mind that the numbers that I talked about which have that decrease, they're two weeks. And so someone can make a change in a routing table, we can see a very big impact. That can also change two or three weeks from now based upon what we do relative to incentives and things like that. And that is the way the business works, and I think that's the way the Durbin Amendment intended it to work.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Next question, operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Carcache of Nomura. Your line is now open.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Charlie, I wanted to follow up on your comment about Visa issuers having I believe you said 12 months of exclusivity to promote their brands on PayPal. Do you have a sense for what would lead issuers to want to take advantage of that period of exclusivity? And do you expect \u2013 you touched on this earlier. But maybe a different way of asking the question is do you expect that the partnership agreement is going to drive a little bit more of a shift in the mix of PayPal volumes funded by Visa products?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Listen, I guess the way I'd put it is I think \u2013 so first of all, it's completely up to the issuers on whether or not they want to proactively work with ourselves and/or PayPal. Again, we're not telling any issuer they have to do anything. But what we've heard consistently from issuers, and I certainly experienced it when I was at one, is that ACH is a really bad thing. You're disintermediated. It's a bad customer experience. They don't understand the process to dispute things. Call centers don't understand information and things like that. And so given a choice, you'd rather have a transaction run over a Visa debit or credit product rather than ACH. So I would assume that most issuers would choose to want to actively engage to try and move those transactions onto cards which, quite frankly, consumers know, love, understand and are very comfortable with how those products work. And so during this period of time, PayPal wants to work actively with us because to the extent that consumers want to do this \u2013 again, I can't speak for them, but consumer choice was an important part of the discussion in the press release, and that's what this actually provides. So again, the way we look at, just as the network \u2013 but the way we look at what we've done in this agreement is we've taken \u2013 we've tried to work with PayPal in partnership to take away the things that discourage people from working together and take away the things that create bad customer experiences. And just when do you that in anything, hopefully you wind up with a position where people actually work together. And if you don't even just get back to \u2013 it should produce a higher level of growth coming from someplace else. And whether that comes from other networks, cash, check, any alternatives out there, we don't know. But that's what this agreement is. It's about taking those bad things out, providing a better consumer experience, and then the consumers will ultimately choose what they want to use. And again, as I said, we feel very comfortable that we'll do quite well in an environment like that, as our clients will.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Bill. Operator, next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Charlie, MasterCard is buying VocaLink. And I was curious if that has any incremental impact to you. Obviously, you dominate debit in the UK. I wanted to get your thoughts there. And also related to that, any early views on PSD2 and what that might mean to your debit volumes?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Listen, obviously they just announced it this morning, so it's very early. So I would say \u2013 and I honestly haven't had a chance to read what they've actually written, but I guess I'd just say a couple of things. And I think the same goes true for PSD2, which is \u2013 we as a network are successful not because we offer extremely low-priced commodity services with very little value-add. It's the exact opposite of that. And the ability for us to have grown the business that we've grown around the world is all about delivering value-added services, whether it's fraud protection, risk scoring, work on marketing, all those things. That's ultimately why people choose networks. And as I said, that's something that we need to deliver both not just to issuers, but ultimately to merchants, either directly or through the acquiring community. And so to the extent that we do that, whoever we compete with, because remember, we've competed, as we've \u2013 we've competed with PayPal, which has had another way of doing business here. And in the physical world, we've done quite well and felt very comfortable with our ability to compete in the online world as we've developed these solutions. So for us, it's about creating that value, delivering on innovation. And I wouldn't underestimate the work that we have done at Visa on fast funds, push payments, and things that we're doing both in developed parts of the world and emerging parts of the world. And so regardless of who buys what out there, those are activities that we had underway because there's tremendous opportunity. And I think those are the things that will allow us to compete, not just with an acquisition out there, but the types of people that will be able to insert themselves into the payment flow because of PSD2.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Don. Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nLisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. It looks like Visa Europe's volume growth decelerated again this quarter on top of I think a deceleration last quarter. Can you just talk about now that you've seen under the hood a bit, what's been driving the deceleration in their volume growth and how you expect that to look going forward, both now that you own the asset as well as in the wake of the regulatory changes in Europe? Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Lisa, Visa Europe's growth has generally tracked well with what we had anticipated. The business is performing pretty much exactly as we expected, if not a little better. And we've seen some \u2013 it's very early to assess the impact of Brexit. We haven't seen much change. We've seen other than the exchange rate impacts, which I talked to you about earlier, we've seen some modest impacts on the cross-border business, as you would expect. Inbound commerce into Europe and the UK in particular is picking up as a result of the exchange rate moves most likely, especially from Asia. Outbound from the UK is relatively stable in transaction terms. But as you would expect, when the currency moves, there is an impact on the ticket itself. But other than that, the business is performing almost exactly in line with expectations.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. Good evening. A quick question on PayPal again. Is it safe to assume that you guys had conversations with the banks and that they were involved in the framework of a potential deal with them? And then just maybe my follow-up related is, if the issuer tokens aren't used by the banks or applied by the banks, does that change the economic incentives part of the agreement? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: On the second question, no. And on the first question, listen, like any business, we have clients and we talk to them. And our clients have been very, very vocal \u2013 not in private to us \u2013 but publicly about what they've liked and what they haven't liked about the interactions historically with PayPal, as I've been. And so when asked, I've been very, very clear about what it is we don't like about PayPal. And I've also been very clear that we think that they've developed some great capabilities, have enormous respect for what they've created. And if we could fix the bad things, we'd be very excited about working together. And so the things that we went about from our standpoint wanting to change are exactly those things. And so I don't think anyone should be \u2013 I'd be surprised if anyone here is surprised about what those things are. And there were some things that were important to PayPal. But as I said, ultimately this is about taking the roadblocks out and creating the opportunity for people to work together. But again, we're not putting anyone in a position where they have to.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Sanjay. Next question, operator?\nOperator: The next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just two questions. I guess first on looking at one of the headwinds, it was market entry costs. So I guess I'm assuming that's China. And in June, China announced their rules for the networks to enter the market. So I guess I'm curious. Have you guys submitted your application yet and the next steps in China? And then just secondly, Vasant, what has Visa Europe been growing at constant currency? And then what is your expectation in the fourth quarter guidance for Visa Europe constant currency year-over-year growth in 4Q? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So on China, I would say the clarity that we need to finalize all the information and submit all the pieces is still coming together. We have submitted pieces of what's required, but there are also some new things that have come forth that we're working through that relate to national security with reviews that are going to be necessary as well as encryption standards, which was something that was new that was added. So these are active conversations that we're having with the Chinese government. And we continue to do all of our planning so that when we do have clarity, we'll be able to submit everything that we need to.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: In terms of Visa Europe's growth, if you look, there's a schedule in our operational data package. I think it's on page six that gives you some historical data on Visa Europe's performance. So if you're talking about volume, payment volume, over the past \u2013 let's say the last quarter, constant dollar payment volume growth was 6.6%. And then over the last year, constant dollar payment volume growth was a little over 7%. So it has been fairly stable if you look at the numbers for the past several quarters. It swings up and down a bit along the way. We're not expecting anything different. We're clearly monitoring the impact of Brexit to see if there's any impact. It's really not evident at this point. It's minor. We'll have to keep watching it. But as far as it relates to the fourth quarter, we're not assuming any change in trend. And in terms of its specific impact on us, you see that in the guidance we provided, where we told you that the revenue impact of Visa Europe on the quarter if you go to the table we have was 13 to 14 points of additional dollar revenue growth that would be added to our reported numbers because of Visa Europe, three to four points of additional revenue growth on a full-year basis. And as far as the income impact, we had told you last quarter and we are reiterating that that Visa Europe's income will offset the debt interest we had. So essentially it will make up for the debt interest in the quarter. So that's pretty much it.\nOperator: The next question is from Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Yes, hi, thanks and congratulations for closing Visa Europe. I did have a quick question on the PayPal release. Just I was hoping you could explain how the V debt portion works in tokenization and how that will enable brick-and-mortar point-of-sale should an issue erupt. Are you just basically saying that PayPal will have the opportunity to wrap a Visa token within the PayPal wallet and then pass it through to a merchant like an Apple Pay would for Visa card acceptance?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. So this in no way is enabling Visa to wrap any other type of funding mechanism in a larger Visa token for acceptance?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not sure I understand what you're asking, but what you described is exactly what's contemplated. To the extent that PayPal chooses to create an experience at the physical point of sale, if they can get the issuer to agree, just as an Apple Pay or a Samsung Pay or Android Pay, there can be a token provisioned to a device. And it will be \u2013 the transaction will take place as these other wallet transactions that use tokens.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Right, and so this would need to be a bespoke agreement between PayPal and an issuer. Okay, I understand. Thank you.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Craig. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thanks. Thanks, Jack, kudos for getting this PayPal deal done. I was curious. Charlie, you said I think at our conference that PayPal can't be friend and foe, and so I was wondering. Does this deal mean PayPal is now 100% friend to Visa? Are there outs or end term dates in the agreement to call out? Also, does the deal change in any way your Visa Checkout strategy? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So the answer is it's a long-term agreement. We feel like we've addressed everything that we wanted to address, and it was a great conversation. We were both trying to get \u2013 again, as I said earlier, what we both wanted to get to was a point that PayPal, ourselves, and the issuers would look at it and say it's something that makes sense for all of us to work together. And that's based upon the fact that we're providing a better experience and the opportunities are greater than ever for consumers and merchants. So having everyone align is what we were after, and that's what we think we've done here. And so we feel very good that we're in a position, as I said, where \u2013 this is a framework where we can work happily together hopefully for a very long period of time because it's going to drive more growth. That's what it's all about. It does not change our Visa Checkout strategy. Here too, I've been very consistent in saying that one of the things that we don't know is we don't know ultimately what experiences are going to win at the point of sale, either online or at the physical point of sale. And so given the fact that we are the global acceptance mark that's recognized more than any in the world, that's something where we should have a solution that leverages that acceptance and allows consumers to pay quickly and easily and securely in the manner that they're accustomed, and that's what Visa Checkout is designed to be. But there are other payment solutions out there. We've talked about a bunch of them on this call, as is PayPal. And so what we want do is ensure that if we're working together under principles that we're happy with, which is what we've achieved here and what we have in the other ones that we support, then we want to enable multiple experiences. And ultimately consumers and merchants will choose which will win in the marketplace. And so we're happy with the progress that we're making in Visa Checkout. We're glad we're doing it. Ultimately, what we're going to look at for success is how Visa usage is doing in the physical point of the world, online, and in mobile, secondarily where it's coming from, and ultimately that will help us make resource allocation decisions. But we want to be the enabler. We want the volume. We're doing lots of different things, and Visa Checkout is one of those things but it's not the only thing.\nJack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, Tien-Tsin, and thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to give Investor Relations a call.\nCharles W.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Sam. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s fiscal second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.Visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually, Jack, it's Charlie. I'm going to start on the call.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: I'm sorry.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I appreciate it though. Good afternoon, everyone, thank you for joining us. There are a series of things that I'm going to cover before I do hand it over to Vasant. I'm going to talk a little bit about our second quarter results at a high level, make some comments about the press release we put out about Visa Europe [VE], some general business updates, and then some further comments on how we see the year playing out from here. So first let me start with our overall results. We reported earnings per share of $0.71, but this includes a one-time gain on currency forward contracts used to mitigate some of the foreign exchange risk associated with the cash portion of the VE purchase. Vasant will cover that in a little bit more detail in his remarks. If you exclude that gain, adjusted earnings per share of $0.68 grew 7% on a nominal basis and 12% on a constant dollar basis. If you remember, we raised $16 billion in long-term debt in December of last year in anticipation of the VE acquisition, and we absorbed $125 million in interest expense during this quarter, a $0.03 drag on our EPS growth for the quarter. This negatively impacted our EPS growth rate in the quarter by five points. After we close the VE transaction, we will obviously have VE operating income to offset this expense. As we talk about the quarter, you're going to hear some themes which will sound very much the same as those we discussed on our last earnings call, reasonable underlying domestic growth offset by some headwinds. Our results adjusting for the leap year were very consistent with the prior quarter. And our growth continues to be subdued by the strength of the dollar on both translation and cross-border business volumes, continued low oil prices, and weakness in China, oil-based economies, and Brazil. But importantly, the U.S. consumer remains strong. Operating revenue grew 6% nominally or 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative three percentage point impact from FX. Adjusting for the leap year, growth was basically the same as the prior quarter. Overall payments volume, cross-border volume growth, and processed transaction growth were consistent with last quarter excluding the one percentage point growth benefit from the leap year. Cross-border continues at extremely low levels. Reported U.S. payments volume growth was 11%. International payments volume growth was 14%. Cross-border volume growth was 5%. Processed transactions grew 9%. And more recently, in April through the 14th, so recognize this is a short period of time, we're seeing similar trends, with U.S. payments volume growth at 10%, cross-border volume growth of 5%, and processed transactions growth of 8%. The bottom line is we continue to see reasonable growth rates but well below what we can produce in a more favorable macroeconomic environment. We issued a press release today regarding the Visa Europe transaction. As we discussed the transaction with the European Commission, we received feedback from them regarding the earnout. Based on that feedback, we and Visa Europe have reached a preliminary agreement to eliminate the entire earnout. Instead of an earnout, we will pay an additional \u20ac750 million at closing and \u20ac1 billion plus 4% interest payable on the third anniversary of the closing, for a total consideration of \u20ac1.750 billion plus interest. The transaction remains subject to negotiation of a definitive document and approval of the European Commission. It's possible that we could close the transaction towards the end of the quarter, but it could slip past the end of our third fiscal quarter. We think this is a good outcome for both parties. We've had many months now to work with the VE team up close and feel terrific about our future together, and we obviously know more now than we knew when we first agreed to the deal. Transition planning is well underway, and we have great confidence in our ability to execute this well. Given the delay in closing, we won't be providing more detailed information on this call. The basic thesis still stands, low single-digit accretion in the first full year, growing to high single digits by 2020. These numbers exclude transition costs. Next quarter we will provide more detail on what to expect after we close. A couple of words on China, there's no real update regarding the timing regarding of our ability to apply for a domestic license, but we have been making preparations to both make our application as well as be in a position to compete domestically. China continues to be a very important market us. We're committed to having a broader business in China that we will build over a long term, and we continue to invest locally in the country. We announced several important partnerships this past quarter, which are great representations of our commitment to create local Chinese partnerships. First, we signed an MOU with China UnionPay, where we both agreed to collaborate on payment security, innovation, and financial inclusion. We're excited to work in partnership with CUP to lead the industry forward. The agreement provides an important platform for the two of us to work together to strengthen and create new value for the bankcard ecosystem, benefiting consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and technology partners. We've also been active committing Visa resources to support the Chinese government's efforts to reduce poverty and promote inclusive finance. We announced a partnership with the China Foundation for Development of Financial Education and the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation to help support progress against these goals. And at the end of March, we signed a cooperation plan with the China National Tourism Administration, establishing Visa as a strategic partner of the U.S. China Tourism Year. This collaboration between CNTA, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and Visa will result in a year-long series of events designed to enhance tourism, trade cooperation, and cultural understanding between China and the United States. On to some updates on client activity; in the United States, the Navy Federal Credit Union, the world's largest credit union and one of our most important clients in the U.S., renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with Visa. We're very proud of our association with this great institution. Beginning June 20, Visa cards will be exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients across the globe. Banco do Brasil, the oldest and largest bank in South America, renewed a multiyear credit agreement. And in India, SBI Card, the State Bank of India's credit card venture, renewed a multiyear credit card agreement as well. We continue to be encouraged by the growth we see with Visa Checkout. We have nearly 12 million registered users in 16 countries and over 675 national institution partners participating globally. Later this year, Visa Checkout will be available to merchants and consumers in six additional markets, including France, India, Ireland, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. More than 250,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers, have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $113 billion in addressable volume. Visa Checkout customers are also more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transactions per person than the overall population of online shoppers. In February, we launched Visa Developer Platform, an open platform that provides access to hundreds of Visa APIs and software department kits for some of Visa's most popular payment products and capabilities. It's still very early days, but we've had strong interest early on in the Visa Developer Platform, with thousands of new users building and testing new applications in our sandbox. We have a small number of clients in or near production launch on the platform, and we expect to see more soon. Let me just give you a simple example of how the platform changes the way we work with our clients. Earlier this year, one of our largest clients outside the U.S. sent a small team to our office in San Francisco with an idea. They wanted to give their cardholders complete control over when and where their cards worked via their mobile app, the ability to turn their Visa card on or off for certain types of merchants or transactions. Working with our team and our new APIs, they designed, built, and launched a working prototype in three days and were ready to be in market in a few weeks. Before Visa Developer Platform, this would have taken months. I'll move on and talk about EMV for a second. Six months out from the official kickoff to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving from mag stripe to chip. More than 265 million Visa chip cards were issued as of March of 2016, making the U.S. the largest chip card market in the world and larger than the UK and Brazil combined. 47% of credit cards and 30% of debit cards have a chip on them today. More than 1 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals, or roughly 20% of all merchants. Based on client surveys, we expect 50% of merchant locations will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar year 2016. One of the main pain points in moving to chip is the additional time it takes to complete a transaction due to the time the card spends in the terminal. Earlier this week, Visa announced the launch of Quick Chip for EMV. The upgrade streamlines the processing of a chip card transaction to enable customers to dip and remove their EMV chip card from the terminal without waiting for the transaction to be finalized, allowing the consumer to put away their card in typically two seconds or less. The enhancement requires only a simple software update to the merchant's card terminal or point-of-sale system. Quick Chip is available free of charge to payment processors, acquiring banks, and other networks to offer to merchants. Several merchant processors and vendors plan to offer Quick Chip to their merchant clients in the coming months, including TSYS, Ingenico, Verifone, Equinox, and V2. Before I turn the call back to Vasant, I want to say a few words about the back half of the year and our guidance. Vasant will walk through the specifics of the changes in our guidance, but a few quick comments. We've not seen improvement in the global economic environment. Relative strength of currency pairs is still unfavorable for us, and the price of oil has remained at low levels. As we discussed last quarter on our earnings call, our guidance assumed that these things would improve. Since we're now in the third quarter, we're far less comfortable that volumes will meaningfully change, so we're officially reducing some pieces of our guidance, especially the third quarter. We could be wrong. We don't know what the global economy will look like beyond tomorrow. It could improve. And when things improve, we will be the beneficiaries. But as of today, with a few exceptions, our business volume growth is not accelerating or decelerating, but we're obviously still seeing meaningful growth. We do know that there will be a turn at some point for the better. We just don't know when. So our mindset continues to be cautious in the short term due to the headwinds discussed earlier, but the long-term fundamentals of our business model remain strong, and our focus is on accelerating global electronic payments. Globally, an estimated 43% of all consumer payments today are still made with cash, which leaves us an enormous opportunity in addition to the growth that we see due to regular economic growth for PCE [Personal Consumption Expenditure]. Last week Visa published a white paper, located on our website, discussing the opportunities to accelerate the growth of global acceptance, and I encourage you to take a look at that paper. It's why we feel good about the work we've done. There's still great opportunity in front of us. With that, I will turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Charlie. Much like our first fiscal quarter, the global macroeconomic environment remained uncertain, but our business performed well. A few points to highlight; first, net revenues grew 9% in constant dollars, with an expected three-point drag from the strong dollar. Nominal revenue grew 6%. The one-point step up in the growth rate relative to the first quarter was mostly due to the leap year effect. Cross-border business was once again very weak but in line with the first quarter's growth rate. The deceleration of outbound commerce from China continues. Cross-border commerce out of commodity-based economies remained anemic. This has added to the negative effects of the strong dollar, especially on our large inbound U.S. business. However, currency volatilities were higher than the first quarter, offsetting some cross-border weakness. Through the first six months, we managed our expense growth to 4% in nominal terms, well below the high single-digit rate we had planned in the first half. We have continued to hold the line on expenses while funding all our key growth initiatives, such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Developer Platform, and others. During the quarter, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash payment for Visa Europe. As these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are mark to market, with gains or losses recorded in non-operating income. We recorded a $160 million gain, which we have excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment. These contracts are expiring in late April. When it became apparent that the Visa Europe transaction would not close before then, we entered into fully offsetting contracts at the end of March, locking in this gain. Coincidentally, this gain is almost equal to our interest expense in the quarter. Lastly, we repurchased 24.2 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $72.23 per share, for a total of $1.8 billion. Year to date, we have bought back 49.9 million shares at an average price of $75.47, for $3.8 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had remaining stock buyback authorization of $4 billion. Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers; note that all growth rates are about a point higher due to the leap year effect. Global payments volume in constant dollars grew 12%. Despite considerable uncertainty and turbulence in the global economy, payments volume growth globally has been remarkably stable. U.S. payments volume grew 11%, with both credit and debit growing at the same rate. Accounting for conversions and the leap day, U.S. payments volume growth was slightly lower than the first quarter. International payments volume grew 14% in constant dollars, consistent with the last quarter. Once again, the impact of the strong dollar reduced nominal growth in international payments volume to a paltry 4%. Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars and were flat in nominal dollars. When you factor in the leap year, the trend was unchanged from the first quarter. Cross-border growth rates in constant dollars have decelerated from 9% in fiscal year 2014 to 17% last year, down to 4% so far this year. As we mentioned on our call last quarter, the first leg down was driven by the strong dollar. And then starting in September last year, growth decelerated sharply due to China and the commodity price collapse. Cross-border commerce outbound from China has dropped from growth rates above 40% a year ago to single-digit levels in the second quarter. Commodity-based economies across Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa have also experienced sharp declines. This has hit our large U.S. cross-border acquiring business hard. Commerce into Europe has been strong, though we do not benefit fully from it yet. More recently, we have seen commerce outbound from Europe into the U.S. pick up. Processed transactions totaled $18.5 billion in the quarter, up 9%. Both U.S. and international growth at 12% and 1% respectively were stable. Processed transaction growth rates will step up in the back half of the year as we begin to lap last year's transfer of domestic processing in Russia to NSPK. Service revenues grew 8%, in excess of nominal payments volume growth of 5%. The pricing we took last year contributed three points to the growth rate. Next quarter we will lap the price increases, and this three-point tailwind will no longer help us. Data processing revenue grew 10%, in line with processed transactions. International revenues grew 8%. Constant dollar cross-border volume growth of 5% was almost entirely offset by the currency translation drag. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by the pricing actions from last year. Currency volatilities were high in the quarter but only contributed modestly to growth, as we are now beginning to lap high volatilities from last year. Next quarter our reported international revenue growth rate will no longer benefit from the price increases. And as I mentioned, currency volatilities were unusually high in the second half of 2015. As such, going forward, reported international revenue growth will depend on the interplay between volume growth and the currency translation drag. Other revenues were down 3%, primarily as a result of lower license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payments volumes. Incentives were generally in line with our expectations, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Higher U.S. incentives due to acceleration of deals into the quarter were offset by lower incentives outside the U.S. due to lower volumes. With expense growth in the mid-single digits, a tax rate of 30.1%, EPS of $0.68 after adjusting for the gain from our currency forward contracts, grew by 12% in constant dollars, and by a healthy 17% when you account for the interest on the debt we issued to finance the Visa Europe acquisition. With that, let me turn to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter and the balance of the year, which excludes the impact from Visa Europe. We now expect net revenue growth in fiscal 2016 to come in at 7% to 8% in constant dollars, a couple of points below our expectations from last October. This is driven by three factors: first, no improvement in cross-border volume growth from current levels; second, somewhat weaker domestic payment volumes due to gas prices as well as weakness in large commodity-based economies like Brazil; third, client incentives likely to come in at the high end of our 17.5% to 18.5% range. In October last year, as we told you on our call, we had hoped that cross-border trends would improve as we lapped the weakening of the dollar in the second half of fiscal 2015. However, cross-border growth dropped from the 8% range to the 4% range in the past six to nine months, as outbound commerce from China and commodity economies slowed sharply. This trend continues. As such, we are assuming little improvement in the cross-border growth rate in the second half. Recent weakness in the dollar should help over time, but it is too early to tell. We have now lapped the sharp gas declines from last year. Last October, we had hoped that this would provide a tailwind for U.S. domestic volumes in the second half of fiscal 2016. This has not happened, as gas prices remain below the lows of last year. Given the recent failure of OPEC to agree on production caps, lower gas prices could persist. As such, we are assuming that U.S. payment volume growth will not improve from current trends in the second half. In addition, payments volumes remain soft in large commodity economies like Brazil and the Middle East. Client incentives are projected to come in at the high end of our guidance range. In the first half, client incentives were around 18% of gross revenue. In the second half, we are likely to run at around 19%. Significant renewals and conversions are driving this trend, particularly in the U.S. Costco and USAA add more than 50 basis points to incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the second half. A few other factors to highlight, these are not new but will impact reported revenue growth numbers in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, we will no longer benefit from the uplift in our growth rate we got from the price increases last year. We will lap the currency volatility peaks of the second half of 2015. There have been some delays in the rollout of USAA and Costco conversions. Given the quarter lag in recording service revenues, these Costco and USAA conversions are a drag on net revenues in the second half of 2016. In other words, incentive expense exceeded revenue recognized. This will of course not be the case in fiscal 2017. On the positive front, if the recent weakness in the dollar continues, the currency translation drag of three points could moderate. Given softer than expected revenues, we will continue to hold the line on expenses, funding key strategic and growth programs while maintaining or reducing costs in other areas. As we had indicated previously, expense growth will be lower in the second half relative to the first half rate. We expect a modestly lower tax rate of about 30% versus the low 30%, which will also help mitigate impact on net income. As you look at the fiscal third quarter, net revenue growth in nominal terms could come in as low as 2% to 3%. In addition to the factors I just mentioned, we will lap an unusually low quarter for incentives in Q3 last year. Incentives were 16% of gross revenues due to deal delays versus an anticipated 19% this year. As we have told you before, incentive shifts from quarter to quarter can impact year-over-year comparisons. Nominal net revenue growth should revert back to the first half growth rate in Q4. With a lower revenue growth range and including interest expense from the $16 billion in debt we issued last December, we now expect constant currency EPS growth in the low double digits. Interest expense will cost us over $0.09 this year, or almost four points of EPS growth. If you account for the interest expense, it puts constant currency EPS growth at the low end of the mid-teens range. The currency translation drag is approximately four points. In terms of the impact of Visa Europe, for modeling purposes, we think it is best to assume the transaction does not close in our fiscal third quarter. As such, we will have interest expense in the third quarter but no operating income from Visa Europe to offset it. Should we close on the acquisition sooner, we will of course break out the impact. If Visa Europe is in our numbers for the full fourth quarter, in rough terms it will offset interest cost in the quarter. There will of course be a variety of non-recurring transaction related costs, which will also break out. We hope to give you a more precise perspective when we talk again in July. As we look ahead to 2017, we remain optimistic that revenue growth rates will step up from current levels. We will begin to see the impact of Costco and USAA conversions kick in, and hopefully we will see some recovery in the cross-border business and gas prices, helped by a weakening dollar. Nominal dollar growth could also pick up as the dollar drag abates. Visa Europe will provide additional ballast, driving EPS growth back to levels you expect us to deliver. With that, I'll turn this back to Jack.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Vasant. I got it right that time. Sam, at this point we are ready to start taking questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMoshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. So it sounds, Vasant, like you're saying that the revenue weakness comes from the rebound that you were hoping for not really happening. I'm wondering. Can you talk a little bit? You mentioned the tax rate, but it seems like even including the interest expense that the impact on net income is actually fairly nominal. Are there other things going on, and can you talk a little bit about what you're doing to preserve or protect net income?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: As we've been doing most of this year, we are holding the line on expenses. I think when we talked to you last October, we had indicated that the expense growth would run I think in the high single digits in the first half and then moderate in the second half. It has, as you can see, run below that in the first half, and we said that the rate will be even lower in the second half. So clearly we are trying to mitigate some of the revenue softness with expense management. And then the tax rate is modestly lower than we might have expected last year. So those two things are mitigating the impact on EPS, but not completely. But other than that, really, those are the main pluses and minuses. I don't know, Charlie, if there's anything you would add.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question.\nOperator: Yes, our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nJason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC: Hey, thanks, guys, just two quick ones related to Europe. First, any other regulatory impediments that you anticipate now that you took care of the earnout? And how much would you expect Visa Europe to drive acceleration in the cross-border volume given all the intra-European travel? I think you had given some pro forma data on that couple years ago. So I don't know if the relative figures would have changed, but any thoughts there?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I guess I'll take the first one. So we have to obviously go back and get approval for this transaction. But as I had said in my remarks, we have gotten feedback. It's specifically related to the earnout. And so what we've crafted eliminates the earnout in its entirety. So as with all regulatory approvals, we need to go through the process, but we would not have struck a deal that we didn't think could be approved.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: On the cross-border question, if you go back three or four quarters and look at cross-border inbound/outbound, one of the strongest markets for inbound travel and inbound commerce has been Europe. So had we had Europe in our numbers, clearly our cross-border numbers would have looked better. What's it going to be like next year? Of course, that's a different issue, and we'll talk about it in the next few quarters as we discuss Europe. But yes, cross-border inbound into Europe has been a strong business.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. I just want to make sure there's no other contingencies outside of the EC approvals, is there, to close this deal. And then just secondly, understanding it's a competitive market today, is there any concern that the removal of the earnout loosens the ties that the banks might have in the future with Visa Inc.? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So listen, on the second one, I think as I said in my remarks, we've had a fair amount of time to work with the Visa Europe team to understand their relationships with their clients. And I would just say that we would not have agreed to a deal that we didn't think was an appropriate price to pay relative to the value that we were getting. Our view is when you actually look at what the earnout was versus where we are today, we're confident in the value that we'll be getting and we will get the appropriate returns. And on the first question of regulatory approval, there were three that we initially needed to approve, Turkey, Jersey, and the European Commission. And we will revisit the first two to ensure, and we will go through the process with the European Commission.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. As you think about the Visa Europe integration process, can you maybe give us an update on the process you're going to go through in terms of identifying synergies? And can you maybe talk about any synergies that you might look for in Visa Inc. in addition to those in Visa Europe?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, let me start and then Vasant can chime in. The work that we've had underway, and keep in mind, just to be perfectly clear, as we have done our work since the announcement of the initial transaction, all the work that we've been doing is just pure planning. They continue to run their business. We continue to run our business. But we've been working very closely together to understand what the best way to organize and run the company is on a going-forward basis. So we've gotten to the point where we have pretty clear plans area by area across the company of what the expense base of an integrated company would look like, what timeframes would look like to get there. We have some more process to go through and we've got some specific processes we've got to go through within Europe to ensure that we do this properly. But when we first announced the transaction, we had done the work with some information but not the kind of information that we have had access to since the transaction was announced. So as I said, we feel very comfortable that we have a better understanding of what those expense synergies will look like and over what time we will get them in addition to having a deeper understanding of what it will take operationally, and feel very good about our ability to get it done.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I think everything we told you then as to what we can do we feel very good about, have much clearer line of sight on precisely how we would do it and over what timeframe. And then to answer the other question you asked, would we look at costs comprehensively and say what is the opportunity when you combine the two both within Visa Inc. and Visa Europe? Yes, we would absolutely do it that way across the functions.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and so just to be very specific, there are some things where we look at what's being done in Europe, and we asked the question. Are they doing it better and more efficiently than we're doing it elsewhere in the Visa Inc. franchise? And if that's the case, which it is in some cases, that could survive and we'll get the synergies within VI.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's right.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thank you; next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi, guys. Just wanted to make sure. Last quarter you guys warned that if there wasn't a pickup on the economy front, we're likely to see potentially changing guidance, so not a real surprise here. But what I want to make sure is, is this all cyclical, or is there any share loss that you're seeing that's causing the change in guidance? And then secondly, we picked up some news that you guys could be increasing your U.S. acquirer fee on Signature Debit on July 1, 2016. Just want to see if that has any impact on the model and if that's correct. Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So let me do the first one first. So to answer the question, everything that we're seeing and everything that we've talked about we absolutely believe is cyclical. It doesn't relate to share in any way, shape, or form and we feel very good about the maintenance of the share that we have across the world. And you're right, I'm glad you pointed it out because we tried to be as transparent as we could on last quarter's earnings call, where we said listen, it's the first quarter. It's very early. We don't know what volumes will be two, three quarters out from now. But our assumptions are that in order to make those guidance numbers, there needs to be an improvement. And things haven't deteriorated, but things haven't improved, so that's playing out exactly \u2013 not the way we would want, but given what's happened, the way we would expect. And so obviously, if things got better, then that would change as well. But we just don't see that. And so it's not something at this point, given that we're already in the third quarter, we think is prudent to think about.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And in terms of the U.S. acquired debit price increase of two basis points, yes, we have informed people about it. They will begin to see the increase in July. But as you know, we record these things on a quarter lag, so there's no benefit from the price increase in this year's revenues. Also, just so that you're clear on it, this is not in any order of magnitude terms anywhere close to the price increase we took last fiscal year, so the impacts are more modest. It's clearly helpful, and of course we provide some level of remediation in the early months. So you should make sure that some of that is factored in as you think about all this.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Bryan; next question?\nOperator: Our next question is from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. So I just want to clarify. It sounds like despite the run rate for the first half of about 8.5% constant currency, the low growth in the third quarter is the timing of incentives, and it sounds like a little bit of a delay in timing on Costco/USAA. Can you just \u2013 any reason for the slower implementation of those, and is the timing for those deals now around the fiscal fourth quarter or early next year? And then just a quick follow-up on the incentive size. I guess when we go forward, had those been in line with the timing of incentives in the third quarter, would your incentive run rate still be in the midpoint of the range? Is that really what we should expect going forward? Thanks, guys.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: On the first one, it's hard to pinpoint it. And the implementation of the Costco arrangement is in a lot of respects out of our hands. Remember, they had an agreement that they had to unwind. There's a lot of work that Citi, the issuer, and Costco are working as well as us. And so given the complexity of unwinding an old agreement and moving forward on a new agreement is just complex. And in USAA's business, there's nothing specific other than I think it's them just wanting to do it in a timeframe which brings about the least amount of potential issues for their members, which we respect.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And on the level of incentives then, we are in the range we told you coming into the year. We are at the high end of the range. And the reason for that is we've had a significant number of renewals around the world and in the U.S. And of course, we've had a couple of big conversions. That's all in our view good news in that we are renewing important contracts and we have some significant new business. As I mentioned in the comments, the benefits from the conversions for sure are not showing up this year and will show up next year. But some of these, as we've told you before, there are timing moves from one quarter to another. And there's no question that the incentives are running at the higher end of the range because these renewals have mostly all now fallen into place.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Darrin; next question, please?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would just say listen, I think to that point, and the reality is these are important renewals. These are very big clients and the new wins we've talked extensively about. And so when we talk about it in terms of how it impacts the numbers, if you just step back for a second and to the question earlier about share, we feel really, really good about what our client franchise looks like for sure across the globe.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, please?\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. Charlie, I wonder if you could maybe opine a little bit on mobile payments adoption, mobile wallet adoption in particular. It seems like some of the big banks indicated recently that it remains quite low and maybe a little disappointing. Are there any implications longer term for Visa's volume around mobile one way or the other? And how do you think about initiatives that Visa might undertake to accelerate mobile adoption which might benefit the secular shift?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I think it's interesting. I think we are doing as much as we can as an entity to insert ourselves in a way which benefits all of our clients and their clients into helping digitize payments in all forms of commerce, and that's how we think about it. We don't necessarily think about that we want to drive business from cards to e-com, to m-com, or anything like that. Anyone who tries to drive something towards what they think is good for them generally hasn't been particularly successful. And so what we want to ensure is that we continue to have the best solutions to pay in the physical world, that we've got the best solutions to pay in the e-com world, and the best solutions to pay in the m-commerce world. And so if you look at the things that we've done all across that spectrum, whether it's the things that you see, such as Visa Checkout, some of the things that we've done with third-party players, whether it's Google, Samsung, or Apple, or whether it's things that you don't necessarily see, like tokenization, these are all aimed at ensuring that we are a preferred payment option in all of those different mediums. And quite frankly, the consumers and the merchants are going to be the ones to drive the adoption of these different forms of payment. And so we're there to support them. We're there to be their partner. We're there to provide options. So the work we did on tokenization enables a lot of the things that you're seeing out there, but we don't prefer one versus the other. We just have to ensure that we're doing everything we can to be inserted into all forms of commerce in a way which is friendly for our issuers and acquirers.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Andrew; next question, Sam.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Howlett with UBS. Your line is now open.\nMatthew P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. Just as a follow-up on the cross-border, what is a normalized run rate? Maybe first start off with what you're seeing in terms of what corridor is it. It looks like the Asian region is coming in a little bit slower. Then, what do we expect is a normalized run rate and what should we expect long term?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: If you go back in time, as you know, double-digit run rates were very common. And then starting about eight quarters ago, you started to see some slowdown, mostly with the strong dollar. And that dropped the run rate down to the single digits, and it ran at about 8% \u2013 9% in constant dollar terms for a while. And then in October or so last year, we saw that sharp decline to 4%, and it stayed there. The biggest drivers are significant declines coming out of China, and that has not changed. In other words, the second derivative on that is still negative. It is continuing to decelerate, though still positive. Canada, a major source of business for us in the U.S., has been declining for several years now. It has gone from a growth rate to meaningful negative levels. Then we saw a significant change in trend in the past few months coming out of all of the commodity economies, whether those are the African economies or the Middle East, big declines in those areas. And then layered on top of that are specific large economies like Brazil, which for a while which was a major source of outbound business to the U.S. and elsewhere; and other economies, like Russia, which you saw really slow \u2013 go down significantly last year. So you've got three things going on at the same time, which may not happen often. One is a strong dollar, which hurts the largest part of our cross-border business, which is the acquired business into the U.S. Second is a significant growth engine called China slowing down. And third is large chunks of the global economy having trouble, like Brazil, like Russia, for a variety of different reasons. So you've got all three things happening at the same time right now.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And just in terms of how it plays out mathematically is \u2013 remember, to the extent that the dollar strengthens, we start to see less spending as goods are no longer as attractive to buy on a cross-border basis. And so you're going from growth to shrinkage, and so on a percentage change basis it's significant. So the first effect will be at some point these things get lapped, assuming that it doesn't continue to get worse, and normal business grows at a reasonable level. And then if there is any kind of weakening of the dollar, then you start to see the spending patterns shift back to what they were, and that changes the growth dynamic significantly.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Sam.\nOperator: Yes, our next question is from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi, thanks. It's Jamie at Susquehanna. I was just wondering, Charlie. Do you have any update on your conversations, negotiations with the aggregators that you had shared some perspective on last quarter? Thank you.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't, I don't. I think what I said is what I and we continue to feel. And if there's anything more to talk about, we'll let you know.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Sam.\nOperator: Yes, our next question is from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nLisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, Charlie. Can you give an update, a little more color on Visa Checkout? How many of your large issuers do you have now auto-enrolling in Visa Checkout, and are you seeing a notable uptick in adoption as a result of that? And then similarly on the acquirer side, do you have any acquirer partners that are actively now helping you promote Visa Checkout with the merchants? Like at some point here, should we be seeing more of a steep acceleration in adoption?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Listen, I think to the last question first, I think it's \u2013 we don't \u2013 when we think about what the adoption curves look like, we're not looking for anything that looks exponential necessarily at this point. In fact, what we want to see is we want to ensure that there is continued growth on both sides of the equation, so not just the increase in the user base, but the increase in the merchant locations as well. And anytime those \u2013 if those growth rates get way out of line, then we live somewhat in fear of one side of the network getting ahead of the other. So we have Bank of America who is very actively promoting Visa Checkout. That has just begun. So it's hard to draw any conclusions to what it means, but we love what they're doing. It is very simple. It's very creative, and we're excited about it. Beyond that, we're very focused on growing the merchant side. And the reality of the merchant side, Lisa, is it really is \u2013 it's merchant by merchant. And so we can certainly \u2013 we've done everything that we can to make it a simple integration for merchants. But the conversation really is, it's not even necessarily \u2013 it's not the typical conversation that either we or an acquirer have with a merchant where we're talking about acceptance or we're talking about an assistant treasurer. The conversations with Visa Checkout are much more about the marketing areas. And so that is where we are focused on is getting the conversation to a different level with merchants, and we're focused on the top merchants, not necessarily the number of merchants or the size of merchants.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Lisa; next question, please?\nOperator: Yes, our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thanks. Good afternoon, just a couple questions. The Costco card has pretty attractive rewards. I'm curious. Does that change the incentive equation for Visa in any way, meaning your role in funding those rewards? And I want to ask a Visa Europe question just as part of the new deal giving up the earnouts. Do you get to then extend contracts with the major issuers from Visa Europe? I was just curious what the give-and-take is beyond what you discussed. Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. The first question was...\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Are we doing anything different with Costco because the rewards are better?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, no. Our deal with Costco is our deal with Costco, and their deal with Citi is their deal with Citi. And so we love the product that's out there. And even more broadly, we love Visa acceptance at Costco for all of our issuers. And on the second item, the answer is no, there's nothing special that goes along with contract renewals or anything like that relative to the additional amount that we're paying. But I think \u2013 I guess the way I would think about this is we certainly when we entered into the earnout, wind up with a point of view of what we think we could pay based upon the results could pan out. And as I said earlier, we've had the opportunity to be able to have a deeper level of understanding of what that could actually be, as well as to have an understanding of what the relationships between Visa Europe and its client base are. And so I just don't know how to say it other than I think we feel very good about the deals that we've struck, just as I'm sure their members feel very good on a risk-adjusted basis they're getting more guaranteed of cash, and so these two things meet at a place where you get a transaction done.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, and everything we've seen and heard indicates that the current members and the current big issuers and customers of Visa Europe actually see Visa Europe as being part of Visa Inc. and one Visa as a big plus. Makes Visa Europe much more attractive from their standpoint with all the capabilities that we are bringing. And in any case, we had always assumed that we were going to work with every one of these issuers to move the relationship from a member relationship to a commercial relationship. And those conversations will clearly be the important things we do with them as soon as we're able to.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I guess I would just pile on a little bit and say, if there's a belief that banks have continued to do business with Visa Europe solely because of its ownership structure, that's a very risky thought process to go down. As we all know, the payments business is extraordinarily important for financial institutions. And as we pointed out on these calls many times, these are financial decisions about the network that they're choosing, but they're also far greater strategic alliances that they're thinking through. And what we bring is just a tremendous amount more to the banks in terms of capabilities. So the relationships that Visa Europe has are very, very strong, and what we have is additive to that. So we feel very, very good about our ability to compete in an open marketplace with others for the banks' business.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Tien-tsin; next question, Sam?\nOperator: Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nRobert Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Vasant, you had mentioned I think just on the Costco incentives and the high end of the range for client incentives for the back half of this year. As we think about 2017, I think you said that we would expect Visa to deliver earnings like investors are accustomed to. And I was wanting for some color on that. And then is the Costco and USAA, are there portions of the fees that are one-time very large fees such that we shouldn't expect the high end of the range longer, that type of a range longer term, or should we think of the higher incentive range longer-term?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: There were several questions there. Hopefully, I remember them all. In terms of the Costco business, all I was saying was that it wouldn't have an impact on 2017. I'm forgetting all the questions. There were several questions there. Jack, can you help me?\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: The first piece was what are the returns or earnings you would expect.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Oh, right, you made some reference to earnings. I just want to make sure that we were just making sure people understood that this year we had two big things going on that hopefully we won't have to deal with next year. One is we have this interest expense, which clearly did not have offsetting operating income in the timeframe that we expected, and that was a meaningful drag on our earnings this year. And clearly, once the Visa Europe deal closes, we will have the offset. That was the intent of the debt issuance. So that was clearly almost a full point of drag on growth, and we just want to make sure people were aware of that. Second, we have seen the headwinds that we talked about coming into the year. We are hopeful that they will moderate as we go into next year. And then third, the conversions that we believe will add some additional ballast, so to speak, to revenues really aren't helping us, in fact, are a drag this year because of this lag issue. So all I was doing was pointing to those things. We'll talk about it next year at the appropriate time and give you our best sense for next year. I think we were just highlighting some of the elements of this year that were fairly unique.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Bob; next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.\nChristopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious. With the software solution you've announced for EMV chips in the United States, do you have an opportunity to roll out the same software solution across the other markets that already have EMV? And would you do this for free or would you charge for it? Is there some potential revenue upside associated with it?\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. First of all, on the second one, this isn't about revenue at all. This is about just improving the customer experience. And remember, around the rest of the world, I'd say two things. EMV is working; it's well accepted. And so we're addressing a very specific concern here as we go through this transition. And then the second thing is, in some of the major markets across the world, there's a very high degree of contactless \u2013 that's a card with a chip in it that can be used on a contactless basis, which are very, very fast transactions. And so we continue to promote that as well, and we don't have the issue outside the U.S. that we have in the U.S. as we go through this transition.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Next question, Sam?\nOperator: Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, Charlie, so you've won two sizable deals with USAA and Costco. I was just curious if there are any other large portfolios or conversions out there that you're looking at. And then secondarily, it sounds like you're a little upbeat on the U.S. consumer, but the volumes did slow a little bit. Wanted to get your sense there.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so let me on the first one, and I talked about this a little bit. I think when it comes to our position, especially in the U.S., where certainly a lot of these big co-brands are, we love the position that we have. We aren't looking to gain share by being very, very active at targeting or anything like that. Costco is very unique. That was Costco looking, initially thinking about whether or not they wanted to change their issuer and their network. And I've spoken about USAA about how that actually came about. So what we're most focused on in the U.S. is continuing to do a great job and retain the great business that we have on the issuing program side.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And on the second part of your question around the U.S. consumer, I think it's important to point out that, I think to perhaps to everybody's surprise, gas prices today are actually lower than the lows reached last year. And in the second quarter, the gas drag was almost as bad as it was last year. It was at least a point on growth in the second quarter. And if it stays at these levels, gas is still a drag on U.S. payment volumes, almost not as bad as last year but quite high. So that's another thing that I guess most people might have expected coming in that you would get to see some kind of a tailwind. It isn't there, but it's anybody's guess though where gas prices go.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, but I think when you look at relatively stable growth in the U.S. consumer spend plus you talk to the banks about increased savings rates, you just draw the conclusion that the U.S. consumer is in very, very good shape. We can debate about the reasons why spend isn't accelerating, but it certainly I would say feels better than some of the stuff that we've heard. And the fact that savings increased at the right point when there's confidence, we feel pretty good that spend will move to higher levels. So if that happens, if the dollar versus currencies changes and all of a sudden our big cross-border business changes, these are things \u2013 back to one of the original questions, these are cyclical things that are out of our control. So when we look at underlying numbers of transactions and we look at how we're doing on share, the numbers are still very, very strong, and that's what's going to drive the business in the long term once we move in and out of these different cyclical trends that we have.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And just one other thing to add, as Charlie said, the underlying transactional trends are very good. And on the margin, even setting aside gas, a stronger dollar is mildly deflationary, as you know, which plays through into payment volumes.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: Sam, with that, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: And our last question is from George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I guess I'll ask a mobile payments question. And that would be, Charlie, any updated thoughts on the potential longer term to monetize tokenization and maybe bring us up to speed with conversations you're having with issuers about them running their own token vaults? We would appreciate any color there.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, we've been very, very consistent that we're not looking to monetize tokenization. Tokenization is a great enabler of different experiences that are out there. We think we're a logical place for the tokenization to take place, but we don't have to be the only place that tokenization is done. So there are some that would like to do more work themselves, create the infrastructure to do that. And we're working with people to ensure that people have that ability. But like most things, we have to compete because we are the right place with the right set of capabilities in a way that they trust more so than other places. And so for us, it's a service, it's an enabler, but not something that we're looking to charge for.\nJack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations: And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining today. If you have any follow-up calls, feel free to give Victoria [Hyde-Dunn] or myself a call.\nCharles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers, and this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining.

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf: Thank you, Jack. I am going to start with a series of comments both about the quarter and a little bit about what we're seeing in the world and then I'll pass it over to Vasant before we take questions. First a few comments about the overall results. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds that we have discussed before. Operating revenue grew 5% nominally or 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative three percentage point impact from FX. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10%, volume growth continued at a healthy pace, growing 11.5% in constant dollars only down slightly from September's 12% growth. U.S. payments volume growth was essentially flat at about 10%, again healthy growth. International payment's volumes growth was 14% down one point from last quarter, but we continue to see weakness in cross border volume. U.S. outbound spend is strong, but it was offset by continued weakness from Canada, Brazil and Russia and more recently we're seeing increasing weakness in the Middle East and China. We do see some areas of strength such as Mexico, Japan and New Zealand, but they're obviously smaller markets for us. Now a couple of words about the U.S. holiday season; overall consumer spending by our Visa Cardholders during the season was similar to last year, but spending patterns are changing. Ecommerce continue to grow at a much higher rate than the spending at physical stores. We saw mid teens eCommerce growth during the holiday period versus mid single digits growth in the physical world. More than 25% of all spending on Visa Cards during November and December was online up from less than 20% just three years ago. Also the pattern of spending during the holidays has changed, while Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain important shopping days, less spending is consolidated on these two days than recent years and more people delay their spending to later in the season this year. Let me move on and say a couple of words about Visa Europe. We're making very good progress. We continue to work towards a projected second calendar quarter closing. We received two of three required regulatory approvals with the third one that's required from the European Commission. Vasant will discuss it, but we feel very good about the execution of our $16 billion debt financing and most importantly we feel as good about the transaction today as the day we made our announcement. We've had great interactions with our Visa European colleagues. We've had a series of very positive conversations with European financial institutions and we remain confident that we're creating value and are focused on execution at this point. We move on to China now. We continue to work towards the ability to make a formal application. We're waiting for final regulations to be released. We have a clear path to have a complying operating environment. So we can compete domestically if we're awarded a license. I was in China last week and participated in the signing of two MOUs. They involve Visa working with two Chinese groups on driving financial inclusion as a means to support property alleviation. The strategic partnership and programs we announced, underscore our long-term commitment to China and to fulfilling the Chinese Government's goal of reducing property and promoting inclusive finance. We also continue to collaborate with government institutions, industry organizations and NGOs to support the global goals of a alleviating property, promoting transparency and fostering inclusive social and economic development. As we work through our plans for entry into the domestic Chinese marketplace, we continue to feel good about our ability to help expand the rate of growth of the Chinese economy and increase the Chinese bank's ability to compete domestically, especially in the eCommerce space. Talk for a second about some client activity, in the United States, we expanded our relationship with Fidelity and U.S. bank where we are now the exclusive payment network for their co-brand card. Card members can earn cash back with the Fidelity rewards Visa Signature Card and Fidelity Investments 529 College Rewards Visa Signature Card. The new cards in the program will be issued with chip technology for security and give access to the payment industry's leading digital wallets including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay. Visa and Walmart announced an acceptance agreement with Sam\u2019s Club. Beginning next Monday more than 650 Sam's Clubs across the United States in Port Rico will begin accepting Visa credit cards in store. Walmart.com and Samsclub.com will also begin supporting Visa checkout this year. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients around the world as well. Just a few notable highlights. We've seen very strong renewal activity across the world in places such as New Zealand, India, China and Latin America. Some names include ANZ New Zealand, ICCI Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China. In Latin America we renewed a multiyear credit, debit and commercial agreement with BBBA, one of the largest issuers within our Latin American region. The deal covers seven markets including Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and Colombia and we renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with PREDESCO another one of our largest issuers in Latin America. We talk say few words about Visa checkout we continued to be encouraged by the growth that we see since it was launched 18 months ago. We have more than $10 million registered users in 16 countries and over 600 financial institution partners participating globally. More than 250,000 merchants including some of our largest global retailers have signed on to accept these Visa checkout representing a $100 billion in addressable volume. Starbucks, Walgreens, NFL Shop, HSN and Match are among the new merchants taking advantage of Visa checkout's ability to deliver seamless digital payments and as I mentioned earlier, Walmart.com and samsclub.com will also begin supporting it this year. Our confidence is Visa Checkout is based upon independent research that supports the nation that it makes commerce easier for consumers and ultimately results in increased sales for merchants. According to new independent research from TomScore, Visa Checkout significantly increases sales conversion. Visa Checkout customers completed 86% of transactions compared to 73% for PayPal Express Checkout and 57% for the traditional merchant checkout. Visa Checkout customers are more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transactions per person than the overall population of online shoppers and 95% of Visa checkout customers say sign up was easy and 96% feel secure making purchases with Visa Checkout. We recently launched a new platform called Visa Commerce Network, built on the trail paid platform, which we acquired in 2015. Visa Commerce Network enables our merchants to deliver targeted discounts and benefits to Visa cardholders in order to acquire new customers and increase sales. Visa cardholders receive these benefits seamlessly by simply using their Visa cards to make purchases. No coupons or codes are required. To-date more than a dozen leading merchants including Duck Donuts, Regal Entertainment Group, Shake Shack and others have successfully used Visa Commerce Network and we recently entered into a partnership with Uber. Uber riders have started receiving discounted rides when they use their Visa Card at certain local retailers. Say a couple of words about the migration to EMV in the United States. We reached an important milestone on October 1, which was the official kick off to chip in the U.S. We\u2019re optimistic about the progress and momentum we're seeing as banks issue more cards, merchants activate ship terminals and consumers increasingly make secure chip transactions. Already there are more Visa chip cards issued in the U.S. then in any other country in the world. More than 200 million Visa chip cards were issued as of December 2015. 43% of all credit cards representing 72% of purchase volume, 21% of all debit cards representing 45% of purchase volume, over 750,000 merchant locations have enabled EMV representing 17% of the total face to face locations in the U.S. Based on our recent client survey we expect 50% of locations to be enabled by the end of this year. While we know we have a long way to go over the next few years to reach the critical massive adoption that we desire, we feel very good about the progress today. Now before I turn it over to Vasant, just a few comments about the environment. It\u2019s clearly a mixed bag but certainly creating some short term pressures for us. The headwinds we discussed last quarter continue and are probably slightly worse with little relief in sight in the short term. As a reminder, they are the translation impact of the strong U.S. dollar, reduced cross-border volume driven by the strong dollar, continuing drag from lower oil prices and while we\u2019re believers in China for the long term the domestic volatility it's creating increased headwinds for us. These headwinds are muting our growth today both through the translation effects as well as reduced business volumes and will likely continue for the foreseeable future, but our ability to grow over the long term will be driven by our continued strong underlying payment volume growth. So, our mindset is that we have to be cautious in the short term due to the headwinds, but the long term fundamentals of our business volume growth remained strong. And as I've said before, our business volumes can change quickly with changes in the U.S. dollar and domestic consumer confidence around the world, it\u2019s just hard to predict the timing. Vasant will cover in more detail but even though there has been much talk over the past few weeks of the slowdown in the U.S., our business volumes in January have been strong. So given all of this, our results are reasonably good, which speaks to the strength of our business model, our brand, our people, but do not reflect the long-term value of the franchise, but the pressure as we have seen we likely continue for the foreseeable future before abating. Now over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thanks Charlie. In a turbulent and uncertain global environment we're pleased to report that our business performed well in the first quarter as a result modestly ahead of our expectations. A few highlights; net operating revenue was increased 8% in constant dollars, the exchange rate drag was three percentage points both in line with expectations. Weaker than anticipated cross-border revenue was offset by lower than expected client incentive. Client incentives were lower due to software volumes in international markets and some deal delays. Expenses only grew 2% well below the high single digit rate we had indicted. We have focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending program given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. As the year progresses we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. We mark down the value of the Visa Europe put from $255 million to zero since the VE Board, Visa Europe Board amended the put in connection with our proposed acquisition. We are required to revalue the put each quarter. We are still awaiting regulatory clearance but expect to close the transaction in line with the transaction agreement leading us to load the value of the put, this non-cash non-operating gain added $0.10 to our reported earnings. As a reminder should the deal not close, the put will be reinstated in its un-amended form and we will need to value this liability based on all available information at that point. In December we issued $16 billion in debt with maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. The weighted average interest rate was 3.08% with the weighted average maturity of 13.1 years. This is the low end of the 3% to 3.5% interest rate range we indicted last year. We're pleased with this outcome. We will of course use the proceeds to fund the upfront cash consideration for the Visa Europe acquisition as well as to step up stock buybacks over the next five to six quarters to offset the dilutive impact of preferred stock that will issue to VE members. For the next section now in place, we will have interest expenses of a $125 million each quarter almost $0.04 per share. In the first quarter we recorded interest expense of $24 million. We will incur the full $125 million interest expense in the second quarter with no offsetting benefit from Visa Europe operating income. Finally we repurchased 25.7 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $78.52 was shared for a total of $2 billion. As we have indicated we stepped up the pace of our buybacks to make up for stock not purchased in the fourth quarter last year due to the impending Visa Europe transaction. At the end of the quarter we had remaining authorization of $5.8 billion for stock repurchases. We've continued to be buying of our stock in January under our 10b5 programs. Moving on to the quarter business drivers. Global payment volume growth in constant dollars for the December quarter continued to be strong at 11%, U.S. credit grew 9%, moderating one percentage point compared to the September quarter as the positive effects of Chase conversion have lapsed. U.S. debit grew 10%, up one percentage point benefitting from some interlinked gains. Adjusted for conversion and the impact of gas prices, underlying growth in U.S. payment volume for both debit and credit have stayed very stable over the past several quarters. In the quarter, the gas price drag was around one percentage point on credit and two percentage points on debit. In December, we lapsed the inflection point for gas price declines, which should help reported growth rates going forward, although gas prices will remain a modest drag since pricing is still below last year. This is already evident in January U.S. aggregate payment volume numbers, which show a modest uptick of one percentage point to 11% through January 21. To date, macroeconomic weakness is not evident in U.S. consumer spending, but this could change as the year progresses. International payment volume constant dollar growth of 14% was down one percentage point from the prior quarter. While 14% is a healthy level of growth, we have seen a step down in growth rate in Brazil, Russia and the Middle East as a result of the oil price collapse and weakness in commodity markets. Growth has remained strong across Mexico and other parts of Latin America as well as parts of Asia like India. Of course the impact of the strong dollar on international payment volume has been significant with growth flat in nominal terms. Cross-border volumes have been slowing for several quarters now. Cross-border growth continues to decelerate, dropping to 4% in the December quarter from 5% in the prior quarter. In the past quarter, we saw a sharp slowdown in outbound commerce from China and the Middle East and the strong dollar continues to hurt commerce into the U.S. You might recall that we had expected cross-border trends to remain weak in the first half and I had hoped for some improvement in the second half of our fiscal year as comparisons became easier and/or the dollar stabilized. Given recent trends, that appears less likely due to the deceleration from oil linked and China linked economies. Through January 21, cross-border volume growth in constant dollars is running at 5%. On the positive front, inbound commerce into Europe remains the strongest corridor, though this has also slowed due to China and the Middle East. Also closing of the Visa Europe transaction we'll begin to benefit from growth of commerce into Europe. Transactions processed over VisaNet totaled 19 billion in the first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period and unchanged from the September quarter. The U.S. delivered 11% growth and international growth was flat, both unchanged from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the international growth rate is negatively impacted by the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April. Through January 21, processed transaction growth was 8% with a U.S. rate of 11% and flat into national growth. Turning to our financial results, service revenues grew 7% in excess of nominal payment volume growth of 4%, helped by the pricing actions we took last year. Data processing revenues also grew 7%. Both were in line with our expectation. International revenue growth dropped to 6% from 16% in the prior quarter. Currency volatility moderated substantially in the quarter reverting to the long-term mean. This drives most of the decline in the reported rate of growth. The impact of the pricing actions we took last year was largely offset by the significant negative impact from exchange rate. While this sharp decline in the growth rate of international revenues was mostly expected, cross-border volumes were weaker as I mentioned earlier due to the China and the Middle East. Exchange rates and revenues from currency volatility will continue to be a drag on reported international revenue growth through the year. Other revenues were down 3% primarily as a result of low license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payment volume growth. As it became clear that the global economy was going to experience a period of turbulence and uncertainty, we focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending plans for the year. As such, we were able to limit our expense growth to 2%. We held the line on personnel cost and professional fees, marketing programs have been reprioritized and phased in the context of the uncertain revenue outlook for the year. Network and processing expenses grew due to the NSPK transition in Russia. Reported G&A expenses were up driven by a variety of factors including exchange rate adjustments and cost of product enhancement. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 29.3% modestly lower than our full year expectation of low 30s. This was largely due to the recognition of certain benefits earlier than we had anticipated. Our full year tax rate projection remains unchanged. Looking ahead to the second quarter, service and transaction processing revenue trends remain unchanged. International revenues remain weak. Currency volatilities are high going into the quarter, but could revert to the mean as they did last quarter and we will lap high volatilities from last year. The exchange rate drag remains approximately three percentage points. Net-net, mid single digit nominal revenue growth appears likely to be sustained. Expense growth rate will step up through the mid single digit range with increases in personnel cost and the growth in network and processing expenses due to Russia. One big change between the two quarters, which is important to note is interest expense. We will have a full quarter's interest expense starting in the second quarter of $125 million, almost $0.4 per share. We want to make sure you all incorporate this into your models going-forward. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, our primary concern is the economic weakness in international markets and the risk that will impact the U.S. As you may recall for our commentary last quarter, our outlook assumed some second half acceleration in U.S. growth and high cross border growth due to easier comparisons. Current trends create some uncertainty around our revenue outlook for the year. As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives that are adequately funded. At this point, there is not much more we can tell you about the back half. In terms of Visa Europe, we do not have any financial updates at this time. As a reminder, our outlook for the full year excludes Visa Europe. Assuming things proceed as planned, we will provide more detail on our second half expectations inclusive of Visa Europe when we talked to you again at the end of April. With that, I'll turn this back to Jack.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Vasant. Sam, at this time, we're ready to start the Q&A. And I'd remind everybody if they could please keep their questions to a single question and then queue back up so that more folks are able to get on the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nBob Napoli: Thank you and good afternoon. A question just on the competitive intensity of the industry and any changes you may be seeing. Certainly the credit card industry broadly at the margin continues to seem to get somewhat more competitive and you also have some regulatory challenges around the world. And historically, this hasn't really been able to penetrate its way through to Visa and Master Card revenue yields or I just -- wondering if you could you any update given the competitive changes on the issuer side and the regulatory changes if there is anything for us to be concerned about on the revenue yield for the business?\nCharlie Scharf: Well, I think the business is competitive and I always remind everyone that our business has been competitive since the day we went public. We and Master Card evolved our structures roughly the same period of time. We compete in the marketplace every single day. And that has been a very consistent way of doing business. Domestically, across the world there are local networks that we compete with. And there are emerging global competitors such as Chinese Union Pay in the traditional space as well as a series of people in the eCom whose names you know that we continue to compete with. I think when we think about what we have at Visa in the quality of the network, the safety, the security, the global acceptance and now the capabilities that we built in the world of digital commerce and the value-added services, we feel terrific about our ability to continue to compete. And we're very, very clear that we know that we have to continue to add value to transactions that run over our network in order to sustain the kind of margins that make this such an attractive business. And we think that there are couple of us with us leading the pack who are uniquely qualified to do that. And so those views I think are very consistent with where they were last quarter, last year and a couple of years ago.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Perlin: So the question I have is as you think about serving all these incremental constituencies, you're much more merchant direct and centric and then also much more consumer direct and centric. I'm wondering how you're prioritizing your expenses when you think about throttling back on projects and what we should be mindful of, because I look back on your expense lines may be back in, we were coming out of the last recession, your marketing dollars as an absolute dollar were almost kind of absolute levels. So I don't know if you pulled that back to norm. I'm wondering where do you throttle back. Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf: Yes. So let me take a stab at it and then Vasant you can add anything you want to add. I think so first of all, it's us who want to want to be really just clear for a second is we are not building a business which is consumer direct and we're not building a business which is merchant direct. There are occasional times when we will do something directly with the consumer or directly with the merchant, but it's in a way that's of course a four-party model in a way that we believe is ultimately good for issuers and acquires. We're just acting as a facilitator. So we still very, very much believe that the model that we have is an amazing model and we continue to most of what we do to work through those people. But the fact is we are consumer brand and we have a role that we've got to play there. When it comes to the comments on expenses, I think -- I guess what you should take away is that nothing that we have done when it comes to re-phasing, delaying or reducing any of the expense dollars that we contemplated in our minds relate to anything, which is going to help build the business for the future. If you ask us, are we as efficient as we should be? Are we spending every last dollar wisely across the place? The answer is no and the answer is still no today. And so what this environment does is it gives us the ability to take a harder look at where we're not as efficient as we should be and attack those dollars. So we've not cut back on anything that relates to building or digital business. The APIs and SDKs that are part of the developer center, the things that we're doing on behalf of merchants, the things that we're doing on behalf of issuers to build our consulting services. We're still very, very committed to building that and as we think about what this environment does is, it's just creating extra focus for us. We certainly don't think that the slowdown that we're seeing that's affecting the business is something that changes the business model for the long term. So we're not going to change the things that we think build the business for a long term as we said here.\nVasant Prabhu: And the only other thing I would add is we've said that the expense growth rate will be back in the mid single digits in the second quarters. And as Charlie said, there is nothing we've done to date that does anything in terms of either the funding or the pacing of critical initiative whether that's Visa Checkout, Visa Direct is token service, all the critical initiative. Times like these are a good opportunity to take a hard look at -- is every dollar well spend and prioritized once again. And we took some time to do that in the first quarter and in the second quarter, the expense growth rate will be back in the mid single digits. And we'll keep monitoring the external situation.\nJack Carsky: Next question, Sam.\nOperator: Yes. Thank you. Next question is from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.\nChris Brendler: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask another question on competitive environments and get your updated thoughts on PayPal in particular. It seems like they've been a good supporter of our online volumes and a lot of transactions are funded by cards. But the opportunity seems a little bit different from the remediation threat. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that particularly threat? And also when it comes to Briantree venture of the in-app development and the potential for remediation risk there, is there competitive response from Visa to some of the technology that they've enabled to or that kind of stuff. Is that area that you could potentially expand and soon become a competitor when it comes to online in that purchases. Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf: Yeah, let me -- let me do the first one first. I\u2019m not going to talk about any specific company. What I will say is that we love partnering with people that we think are good for the payment system and preserve our client's roles and our role in the ecosystem and there are many examples around the world of people that we partner with in ordered to do that. There are also some examples of people that don\u2019t do that and people that generate business for us in the short term whose business model is built around dis-intermediating us eventually and our clients is not something that we like, not something that we support and not something that we're just going to sit ideally by and watch. Our first preference is to figure out how to work differently with those people. Those are the active conversations that we're engaged in. If we can't get to a predicted conclusion there are a lot of things at our disposal that we can do which we have not done, which will enable us we believe to compete in a very clear and very direct way in a way that\u2019s a level playing field for everyone. And so our first preference is to figure out how to partner with people, but if that doesn\u2019t work out then we will compete directly with them and that will evolve in the near future and so more to come on that and the second question was around\u2026 I guess the question was there are people like Braintree out there whose services help enable mobile commerce and what\u2019s our response to that and on this one, our response is multiple on multiple fronts. First of all we have a great business in cyber source where we also own a business called authorize.net that deals with smaller merchants and helps enable smaller merchants to accept online payment. That business is focused both in the browser space, but also in the mobile space and we've just made a series of changes internally with some leadership changes that we're very excited about to help reenergize the business there and to be in a position to compete. We also made an investment in Strip and work very closely with them and we think they\u2019re just extremely talented people who are almost solely focused on the mobile space and enabling mobile commerce in a way that\u2019s very friendly to us and we're excited to continue to help them build their business globally.\nJack Carsky: Next question Sam.\nOperator: Yes, thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, could you talk a little bit about -- you mentioned a couple of very large merchants that are going to be deploying Visa Checkout this year. Can you talk a little bit about what the sales and implementation cycle might be and how to think about the progression perhaps over the next couple of years in that does it seems like it's pretty important from a competitive standpoint?\nCharlie Scharf: Yeah, so the sales cycle -- honestly the sales cycle varies dramatically with the priorities that the individual merchants have and obviously the more continuing success that we have changes that sales cycle as well. When we're able to quote the kind of numbers that we're able to quote on comScore for what it actually does to merchant sites and the merchants themselves and actually share those experiences, nothing changes the sales discussion more than that. And so I think it's fair to say when we first started these discussions. It could be six to nine months in terms of a calling process if not longer. I'll tell you I saw a note today on the way down here that we got an incoming call from a sizable merchant, which was very surprising to me saying that they would like to implement Visa Checkout. So it really is -- the game is changing, but we also in our minds we know, this is merchant by merchants, it\u2019s a long term build and we just have to continue to show the kinds of progress that we're seeing with these -- about the numbers of merchants and the size of merchants. The implementation piece -- I hear what it was, but its dramatically quicker and easier for merchants to implement. If they can fit us into their queue it's literally weeks at this point as opposed to when we had the first incarnation it was multiple months. So the real issue is just making sure they understand why it's good for them and just having a merchant decide that its priority for them and that\u2019s what we're starting to see.\nJack Carsky: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks guys, so this quarter clearly seems to support that Visa can really protect the bottom line with cost controls and more or less any macro climate, but obviously the tone is getting understandably more cautious regarding the global volume outlook. So, I understand you're not changing your fiscal '16 revenue growth guidance, but just curious whether or not the lower end now feels more likely than it did at the time of the last earnings call. And then just very quickly any metrics on Visa Checkout volume you can share.\nVasant Prabhu: I\u2019ll just jumping on your first question. The thing to point out is if you look at international payment volumes as we said in our comments, in constant dollars they were actually up 14%. So it's still incredibly healthy growth and then in nominal terms, it comes down to zero. If you can see what an huge impact exchange rates have had and U.S. payment volumes both credit and debit if you adjust for conversion and GAAP have been remarkably stable. So that\u2019s what makes us optimistic about the long term. In the short run as Charlie said there is two issues, it's the strong dollar is hurting commerce into the U.S. which is a very sizable business for us and has been a big drag now for multiple years. The dollar also affects translation. You saw that from 14% constant dollar growth to zero it's huge. And the cross-border trends, clearly are being hurt by both the strong dollar as well as what\u2019s happening in commodity markets China etcetera. So, we feel these as not really reflecting the long-term trends in our business and so we really don\u2019t want to change anything in terms of our long-term profile of investment, but we are also mindful of the fact that the new few quarters we will face the same pressures. So all we're really doing is being prudent and prioritizing, they are not fundamentally changing anything in our investment posture and I guess the next question was on Visa Checkout numbers. I think you provided some in your comments.\nCharlie Scharf: Yeah but we actually don\u2019t provide the volumes.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thanks very much. Charlie my question is also on an element of the competitive environment, which is we\u2019ve seen Visa now maybe partnership in new ways with some of the banks in order to win portfolios that were and co brand relationships that were up for [RFP] and of course there is the evolving relationship with JPMorgan and what they're doing now on Chase Pay. And so I wonder is there something occurring now between Visa and the banks in terms of that the kind of relationship that banks are seeking to have with you in the United States that's different than in the past because it seems like the stance is a little more aggressive in response to some of the dynamics that are making growth to hard to come by in the States.\nCharlie Scharf: I think it\u2019s a good question. I think and I think there are couple of different things going on. I think first of all part of what you're seeing in the evolving relationships that banks have with the networks not just in the U.S. but around the world is as the years past, since we have transitioned from association to public company, networks are kind of sorting out their point -- I am sorry, banks are sorting out their point of views on networks and what they want those relationships to look like. And so what you start to see now is at the same time payments evolving very, very rapidly driven mostly by digital, but by -- but I think also as importantly, the payments businesses broadly including the debit card business and the credit card businesses are now very much a part of what a bank does and why they think about their entire relationships as opposed to five, six , seven, eight years ago we were transitioning from the majority of the business being done on the credit side by standalone companies. So all a sudden being integrated into a bank, but still being run separately. So as they combined these businesses and really run them as an integrated business they're now thinking about how they need to have a partnership with a payment network, which is much more strategic as opposed to just a third party provider services. So what you're seeing is you're seeing longer term contracts whether its people used to do one and two year contracts and now you've seen us do three, five, seven and 10 in some cases and that\u2019s because it\u2019s a -- it is a different kind of relationship. I think the other thing that\u2019s going on in the marketplace is you start to see especially here in the United States banks have become very, very good at understanding the different segments, the different opportunities that they have to use payment products to serve their clients and they're able to compete with the like of other names out there that they didn\u2019t necessarily focus on before and are having great success in that. And when you have success, it gives you confidence to go get more aggressive in some of these co brands and some of these other things that you see. So, what we want to do is to be the payment partner of choice, to be the one that helps them think strategically as well as to be the best actual provider of network services and you're seeing people make choices relative to who their network partners is and what that means for the aggressiveness in the marketplace is it\u2019s a more competitive marketplace. But again to me that's something we\u2019ve seen it increasing over a period of time and it's because there are people -- there are more people that have better abilities in the payments space today than there were three years ago, five years ago or 10 years ago.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nJim Schneider: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if I could ask a question about the U.S. consumer trends that you're seeing. Clearly it sounds like from the data you\u2019ve seen so far, I was seeing any material downtick in the U.S. consumer although you\u2019re watching it very closely. But can you maybe talk about any other kind of underlying stats you're looking at. I think almost a year ago you talked about the speculation about lower gas prices driving increased saving and banking of that savings. I am wondering if you\u2019re seeing any evidence of increasing discretionary spend and then just as a clarification relative to the one point of acceleration you mentioned so far, year-to-date if I strip out the effect of lower gas prices, would you still be seeing the same consistent underlying trends or the one point of acceleration. Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: I think what we're seeing is a very stable U.S. consumer environment. If you look at multiple quarters all the way through last year and into this year and you adjust for as we said conversions and gas prices it's in very stable for any question marks about whether the benefits from gas prices floating into. We've seen a little bit of that on the debit side as we said that earlier. Yes, there is a small benefit as you look at January from the impact of gas prices declining, but gas prices are still below where they were last year. So we had a two percentage point impact on debit one on credit that will moderate, but won\u2019t go away completely. So most of it we would ascribe to that. Wouldn\u2019t read too much into three weeks of January, we then had some awful weather in the last few weeks, last few days and that definitely will affect some of the commerce. But overall I don\u2019t think there is a whole lot more we have to add than what Charlie gave you in terms of holiday spend shift to commerce channels. I don't know if there is anything else you could add.\nCharlie Scharf: No I think that\u2019s it.\nJack Carsky: Okay. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks guys, look I just want to follow up on guidance, since your guidance was provided last quarter, we had further deterioration on some macro areas like you mentioned gas prices and definitely some of the emerging oil based economies, but again you maintained your guidance for now and did pretty well in the quarter. So I guess as of now do you include similar trends on the slower areas like Brazil, Russia, Middle East as persisting at these similar rates throughout the year and then what if anything would you say has been a surprise to the opposite since last quarter on revenue that might offset the slower macro, maybe it was cross-border versus the 3% right, if you can just give you us more color on that. Thanks guys.\nCharlie Scharf: Yeah, listen this whole concept of guidance is it\u2019s a very strange thing right because you're asking us what we think our volumes will be next quarter, the quarter after that and the quarter after that? And we know a little more than you know, not a whole lot more. So asking people to give procession in terms of what\u2019s going to happen effectively to the dollar, consumer conference, things like that. We really don\u2019t know. So, what we try and to do is be as transparent as we can about what do know. And we recognize that it's hard sometimes to figure out what a trend is and it's hard to know what the triggers will be to either seen an uptick or downtick. So we try to be very clear in our remarks that we\u2019re not changing guidance, but if we don\u2019t see improvement then the guidance will come under pressure.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah and I think if you want to know what could offset, we told you that we saw some additional factors that were causing deceleration in cross-border trends and that was really two main things that was travel out of China and it was travel out of oil linked economies. What could cause -- what is the most significant variable that could cause trends to change in a positive way do we know what's going to happen? We don\u2019t, but it\u2019s the dollar. If the dollar begins to show some signs of weakness clearly it has a big impact on our business not immediately, but over time on two fronts. One the translation impact, which you can all estimate, but then there is the other impact, which will play out over time which is, commerce into the U.S., which is a big part of our business. And then in the second half certainly Europe will be part of Visa and the travel into Europe has been better than travel into other geographies. So hopefully, that will help us and some of that we knew going into the other end and giving some of our perspectives we incorporate some of that.\nCharlie Scharf: Just to give you a little sense. We were looking earlier in detail at the cross-board spend and if you look at -- look over a much longer period of time when you go back to when our cross-border growth was in the low double-digits versus where it is today and say where is -- what\u2019s the biggest effect? Almost something like 75% or 80% of that effect is -- the reduction is from sales wired in the U.S. So it\u2019s the drop in spending of non-U.S. cardholders in the United States. Just -- it\u2019s a very, very dramatic, very clear, very specific item predominately driven by the dollar, not totally, but predominately driven by the dollar and it moves quickly on the way down and at some point it could quickly change the other way as well we just don't know when.\nJack Carsky: Next question Sam?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nKen Bruce: Thanks, good afternoon. My questions really relate to some earlier comments, I\u2019ve recognized that you have some expenses that you can manage. I was wondering if you might be able to provide some sense as to what you would -- how we should be thinking about what would be core spending or core investments in the expenses versus may be some of those areas that you talked about in terms of gaining more efficiency. So, just so we kind of have an understanding as to how much leverage you have from that standpoint. And then second question are you --and this is granular, but are you seeing any changes in activity within the U.S. in those areas that are particularly known for high energy or high exposure to gas and oil in particular? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah I think you can see some of this from things that we might put out through our economics, but there is clearly this, you can see the subdued activity in oil, oil related states and the West is doing better in aggregate then other parts of the country. But other than that I don\u2019t think there is anything we would tell you that is not available from other sources of data that you see. The other question was on the cost side. What we said earlier was cost related to technology initiatives that are critical to product development for the future, cyber security, those have a long-term -- we have a long-term perspective on that and there really is no change in our posture on those things. It's on the margin where we can tighten the belt on things that maybe somewhat more discretionary and you could do them later or you could do them now and there comes a point where you criminally don't want to cut below a certain level. So we're being very prudent. We see many of these as transient and cyclical kinds of things with some strong underlying trend. So we see no reason to change our posture on our long-term investment outlook.\nCharlie Scharf: And the only thing I would add is that we're going through the initial discussions with our colleagues at Visa Europe and so obviously after we close the transaction, we'll go with full fledged integration. And that just is an opportunity to help us focus on efficiency in general and just to repeat what we said is that we still are believers that the underlying trends in the business are extraordinarily strong that there are places that commerce is moving to and we're building the appropriate solutions that will enable us to be as successful in the digital world and the physical world and we're very committed to continue to invest in that space. But remember we are a very young for-profit company. It wasn\u2019t that long that we were an association and so opportunities to focus internally and to get smart about where you're spending your dollars to ensure that they're going towards the future and towards client-driven things is a good thing and that's our focus as we talk about the allocation of our resources.\nJack Carsky: Next question Sam.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. I guess I have a question on the share buyback and the dilution offset to the preferred issuance. Understanding the markets are volatile, but is there anything that precludes you from maybe having a little bit of a shorter time horizon in repurchasing those shares? And then just one data point question. Do we have -- and I am sorry if you guys have disclosed this before, but do we have a specific number on how much of your volume is travel that's coming out of China into other countries? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: I believe on the second question no, we don't -- we don't provide that. In terms of buyback if you calibrate the buybacks, as you know our buybacks have always been more problematic than opportunistic, but within the programmatic buyback, you've seen us calibrate up or down depending on market conditions and assessment of valuations and so on. So yes, there are opportunities to speed it up if we want to, but I think our best expectation remains what we told you earlier, which is that our goal is to buyback or offset the dilution caused by the issuance of the preferred stock by the end of fiscal year 2017? The pace in which we do that whether it's more in some quarters, less in others, I am sure will calibrate as each quarter comes by.\nCharlie Scharf: The only thing I'll say is to add on that is we have and well, I guess I will say this way, if you look at our actions on the debt offer, we issued the debt in December well ahead of what we expect to be the closing day because we looked at what we thought the right long-term economic decision was as opposed to what the negative effect would be this quarter and next quarter. And so when it comes to buybacks, it's the same economic discussion and obviously depending on the size, depending on how you want to accelerate there are different cost to do those things and we think about that in terms of what the right thing for us to do is.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nCraig Maurer: Hi thanks. Two questions. First just on -- should we expect the incentives that were pushed out due to the delays on show up in the fiscal second quarter or will they be spread out more through the year. And secondly, Charlie Visa Checkout, we've been noticing a lot of incentives being pushed through the channel for consumers to sign up and use the offering and I was just wondering if you could comment at all regarding potential share gains against competitors in the digital wild space if there is any anecdotal evident there yet, thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Our planned incentive as I mentioned in my comments, some of the reason they were lower than we expected, they were in the middle of the range rather than the high end of the range. So it was a small difference. Partially it was volumes because our international volumes were lower and so you get a reduction in incentive payments as a result of lower volume and it was only partially because of delays and some of those yes, they will move into the second quarter and so you should expect that the second quarter time incentive range will not look a whole lot different than the first quarter, but these are small shifts. These are not big shifts. And I tuned at after the first quarter. What was the second question.\nCraig Maurer: Visa Checkout. Visa Checkouts anecdotally do we now for gaining share of other Checkout IT solutions.\nCharlie Scharf: I don't know the answer to that to be honest.\nJack Carsky: And we will go to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan Keane: Thanks. I just wanted to ask again about the revenue sensitivity. So if cross-border doesn\u2019t accelerate in the U.S., doesn\u2019t accelerate in the second half '16 as is in the guidance and let's just say the cross-border stays at this depressed level along with the U.S. staying more the same, are we talking about potentially then the revenue guidance for the full fiscal year '16 has to come in and you would protect kind of the bottom lines or other cost cuts. Just want to make sure I know the sensitivity of what happens if it stays more the same environment, thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I think you can probably run those numbers as well as we can. Cross-border the international revenues are roughly 20% of our revenue base and they're about 6% now and maybe there was an expectation that it would be somewhat better in the second half as we lap easier comparison. You can sort of look at it if it stays at these levels what -- we wouldn't do anything that would be wrong for the long term in our business. As we said, we will continue to look at phasing and prioritizing expenses while investing in things that matter. So I think we're suggesting that we can offset all revenue shortfalls that might emerge and it is too early really to tell you how the second half might shape. As you know, when we get to the second half, the comparisons do get somewhat easier. So we'll have to see how that plays out. We'll have to see what the dollar is doing at that point. Lots of unknown. We've given you our best sense of the next quarter. It looks to be very similar to what we saw in the first quarter and that's about as good as\u2026\nCharlie Scharf: The only thing I would add, let me, to your point Vasant is we tried -- we feel like we've got a much better line of sight obviously to the next quarter. So we try to be as clear as we can there and as we get to the end of the next quarter, at that point we should -- we should have a much more definitive point of view on what the year looks like as well as the impact of what the year will be at that point in time.\nJack Carsky: At this point, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Great. Thanks for fitting me in. Just and good job on the expenses here, I just wanted to ask about some of the tailwinds and if there is any update on the timing and I am curious if your outlook already contemplates USA and I guess Cosco and some of those things coming on, thanks?\nCharlie Scharf: Yes, there is no update on those things. They're all proceeding on plan and they were in our guidance.\nJack Carsky: And with that, we would like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give either myself or Victoria a call. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. And this does conclude today's conference.

We're actually conducting this call from our New York City office, which gives us an opportunity to do a morning call, but I do appreciate everybody joining us early in the day and obviously very early in the day if you're on the West Coast. I'm pleased to say that we had another very solid quarter of business performance, resulting in a strong finish to our fiscal 2017. We saw our broad-based business momentum carry into the fourth quarter as we'd outperformed our expectations. Similar to prior quarters, we saw a healthy cross-border growth globally despite lapping what was a strong double-digit quarter last year. We saw a good domestic growth in multiple countries, including India, Russia and Australia. In the United States, our domestic business proved to be resilient despite concerns about slowing retail sales data over the past quarter. And although payments volume slowed in the U.S. due to expected lapping of notable partnerships, we did see healthy payments volume growth across all the regions with total growth in constant dollars of 10%. Processed transactions sustained a solid growth rate of 13% globally. And we had a high level of contract and renewal activity in the quarter, driving client incentives to 21.7% of gross revenue, the highest percentage for the year. All of this led to a strong fourth quarter financial results as we delivered net revenue growth of 14% and adjusted EPS growth of 15%. After I'm finished with my remarks, Vasant will go into greater financial detail on some of the comparisons and provide more background on the numbers. Now let me take a few minutes to cover business highlights as we had a particularly active quarter in terms of partnerships and announcements. We completed two significant partnerships in Russia and our CEMEA region. We signed a multi-year partnership renewal covering a full portfolio with Sberbank, the largest bank in the region. And we renewed a multi-year credit and debit partnership agreement with Alpha Bank. In Asia, we executed a multi-year credit deal with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. In Europe, we continue to make good progress with our clients. This quarter, we reached our goal and resolved approximately 75% of contracts moving from rebates to commercial incentives. We expect the remaining 25% of contract to shift into the first half of FY 2018. On the digital product side, we launched our new mobile solution mVisa in Kenya and Nigeria, and we've been working hard to bring merchants and consumers onto that platform. We announced a global partnership with Marqeta, an innovative card-issuing platform designed to drive new commercial and consumer payments experiences. In July, we extended our strategic partnership with PayPal to Europe to accelerate the adoption of secure and convenient online, in-app and in-store payments across Europe. In August, we launched a national rollout of Visa local offers with Uber. This allows riders to earn Uber credit for making purchases using their Visa credit card at a number of local participating merchants. We also announced partnerships with Fitbit and Garmin to enable digital payments through their wearable devices as mobile connectivity increases. And our push payments product, Visa Direct, continue to perform very well as we saw accelerating volumes with over 75% year-over-year growth driven by North America and the CEMEA Regions. This month, we announced our partnership with Billtrust to help streamline the reconciliation of B2B payments. We also made a strategic investment in Billtrust to help support its efforts to grow the important B2B segment. And most recently, we announced Visa ID Intelligence, which is a platform that allows issuers, acquirers and merchants to quickly adopt emergent authentication technologies and to create more and convenient ways, which are secure for consumers to shop, pay and bank on their devices. So as you can see, we had a lot of exciting activity this past quarter. Now, I'd like to look back over the last year, which was my first year at Visa, and I'm gratified with our ability to execute our operating plan guided by our strategic pillars. As a result, we have delivered excellent financial results every quarter this year. In terms of the drivers of growth, I'd highlight the following. First, Visa has a strong and experienced set of issuer clients who have worked hard internally and with us to drive payment volume growth. We have a real and committed focus on client engagement around the world. New partnerships like USAA and Costco were obviously big contributors in the first three quarters of the year. Economic growth around the world has been strong, which has driven increased e-commerce in more developed countries and a combination of new solutions and positively activist governments has helped drive growth in less developed countries. The good economies around the world also spurred healthy levels of travel, which helped grow our important cross-border business, where we saw healthy results in each of our five Regions. New solutions like mVisa, which I mentioned, for less developed markets and digital solutions like Visa Checkout, Visa Direct and Visa Token Services in developed countries are starting to take hold, although I would say it is still early innings. Our growth has been robust despite exchange rate headwinds for most of the year, and these headwinds appear to be abating as we go into next year. And then the addition of Europe to the Visa lineup has been a real catalyst for growth in 2017. And speaking of Europe, over the past year, I've been asked repeatedly how the Europe integration is going. So let me take a few minutes to give you some thoughts on this question, and I'll do so by briefly addressing Europe in terms of partnerships, revenue, expenses, people, regulation and technology. The overall headline is that we are pleased with the progress and running well ahead of where we thought we would be. We worked hard to bring the best of Visa Inc. from around the world to Visa Europe. At a recent client event, I said that the acquisition brought Europe to Visa and the world to Europe. In terms of partnerships, our clients in Europe are eager to bring our global innovations to Europe as fast as possible. We have more to do for sure, but we've had many senior leadership reach out to our key clients and established an innovation center in London over the past six to nine months. We have already brought a number of our digital solutions to Europe as well as some of our strategic partnerships. We held a large European client event in Barcelona about a month ago, and the feedback from clients relative to the integration and Visa in general was very good. In terms of revenue, we have worked hard to commercialize the business by selectively introducing new pricing and moving from rebates to incentives. And again, more to do, but we are off to an excellent start. In terms of expenses, we moved faster than anticipated rationalizing our expense base to take out redundancies. In terms of people, we've reshaped much of the Europe leadership team. The CEO who steered the acquisition left in early 2017. And I asked a Visa veteran, Bill Sheedy, to take a multi-month temporary assignment as the head of Europe, and Bill did a simply wonderful job driving the organization through the integration and all the associated changes. Bill created a team that looks more like our other regional teams around the world by elevating some Europe talent, importing Visa people from other geographies into Europe, and hiring some terrific new people from the outside. And speaking of new people from the outside, about four weeks ago Charlotte Hogg took over as our regional leader for Europe. Charlotte comes with experience at the Bank of England, where she was the COO, Santander UK, Experian, Discover, Morgan Stanley, and McKinsey. Charlotte has hit the ground running, and I'm confident that she'll be an outstanding leader of Europe. And Charlotte will be able to continue to lean on Bill, who will remain in Europe for the next month or so. In terms of regulation, we certainly recognize that there is more regulatory activity in Europe than the other regions. Our strategy has been to engage actively with regulators, with whom we desire to build high-quality relationships, and with our clients to make sure we shape win-win outcomes wherever possible. Finally, relative to technology, we are on or slightly ahead of schedule. The migration of the technology platform is a key priority for us, and we have focused much time and attention on it. Our objective is a smooth transition for our European clients to a global technology platform that will open up a wider set of solutions and products. So five quarters in, revenues are tracking above projections, expenses are below, with a lower effective tax rate. EPS accretion in FY 2017 was in the mid-single digits, and the momentum is good as we enter 2018. So as we begin fiscal 2018, I'm excited about the many opportunities in front of us. 2018 will mark the end of the first decade of Visa as a public company and the commencement of the second decade. Relative to 2018, let me offer a few thoughts. The fundamentals will continue to matter a lot, so we will be focused on lifting our game, our client engagement across the world. We will also continue on a journey that I began on the day I joined Visa, which is to build a world-class organization in terms of talent and leadership. We have put a number of building blocks in place in the last 12 months to drive improvements in all areas of the talent continuum, and we have significantly dialed up the emphasis on leadership and the expectations that I have of the leaders at Visa. When we talk about fundamentals, cyber security is critical, and we will continue to invest to make our technology environment and the payments ecosystem as safe as possible. We are mid-process toward a goal of empowering our regional and country management teams in a greater way. We want to push more decision-making closer to the markets and our clients. We do so because while we are a global company, we know that the consumer businesses around the world are indeed local in nature and therefore different. In doing so, we will ensure that there is appropriate level of staging, oversight, and accountability. We will invest against initiatives that are consistent with the seven pillars of our strategy. We outlined many of our growth strategies at our Investor Day in June. In FY 2018, we will continue to invest aggressively in a set of focus priorities. Our areas of focus include driving greater and faster adoption of our digital solutions, expanding Visa Direct, extending acceptance around the world, driving cross-border growth, and advancing Open VisaNet. Relative to Europe, we have developed a strategy that is consistent with our global direction but customized to the specifics of Europe. We are bullish on Europe and think there's a good deal of upside. We see tremendous diversity across the markets with countries that have large cash-based economies, balanced by others that have moved to near-cashless economies. In fact, immediately following this call, I'm headed to London for two days of strategy and action planning meetings with the Europe leadership team. As we look ahead to the next decade, disciplined capital allocation remains critical, with the following prioritization. First, our top priority is to invest at healthy levels to drive robust organic growth in our core businesses. Second, we will explore selective acquisitions that bolster our capabilities and enhance the value we can offer to our partner banks, acquirers, and merchants. Third, we will return excess cash to you, our shareholders, through dividends and buybacks. In FY 2017, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. In FY 2018, with a higher dividend payout recently authorized by the Visa Board of Directors and stock buybacks in excess of $7 billion, we expect to return over $9 billion to shareholders, even as we invest at healthy levels in our business. In closing, our expectation is that 2018 is only the first year of a multiyear plan that ensures our second decade continues to deliver superior shareholder value through long-term sustainable growth, much as we did through the first decade. With that, let me turn it over to my partner, Vasant Prabhu.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Thank you, Al, and good morning to all. We had a strong finish to fiscal year 2017. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter net revenues and EPS were both up 14%. As a reminder, this is the first quarter where we have Visa Europe included in our reported numbers in the prior year. We closed fiscal 2017 with full-year net revenues of $18.4 billion, up 22%. Net income on a GAAP basis was $6.7 billion, and EPS was $2.80. On an adjusted basis, net income for the full year was $8.3 billion, up 21%. And EPS was $3.48, up 22%. All in all, a strong growth year, which exceeded our expectations, especially in Europe, which contributed with mid-single-digit EPS accretion. Europe net revenues were ahead of our acquisition model projection, and operating expenses were below projection, with a lower effective tax rate post the legal entity reorganization we completed earlier this year. A few other points to note. Payment volumes on a constant-dollar basis, excluding Europe co-badge volume, continued to grow at double-digit rates globally. In the U.S., the step-down in growth rate reflects the lapping of Costco and USAA conversions in 2016. As a reminder, Costco started accepting Visa credit card in-store on June 20, 2016, and the first co-brand cards were issued. USAA credit conversion was completed in September 2016, USAA debit conversion completed by October 2016. Strong cross-border constant dollar growth was sustained in the double digits. However, the weakening of the dollar, particularly relative to the euro and the pound, is starting to have an impact on the mix of cross-border business. Most notably, outbound commerce from the U.S. is slowing down as is inbound commerce into Europe, especially to the U.K. There is some improvement in outbound commerce from Europe, but no meaningful pickup yet in inbound commerce into the U.S. These shifts will need to be monitored. Natural disasters have impacted our business. In Houston and Florida, it appears that business has largely returned to normal after some significant dislocations around the hurricane. However, the effects of the hurricanes on the Caribbean and the Mexico City earthquake are ongoing. Travel into and out of these locations continues to be below trend. As expected, we had a very active quarter on the contract renewal front. In Europe, we were able to achieve our goal of getting approximately 75% of the contract conversions from rebates to commercial incentives that we had set out to do resolved in fiscal year 2017. Approximately 25% are shifting into the first half of fiscal 2018, largely driven by client timetable. We also had several significant renewals in China and Russia. As a result, client incentives as a percent of gross revenues were 21.7% in the fourth quarter, well ahead of the full year run rate of 19.9%. The approximately 25% of contract conversion that are shifting to fiscal 2018 in Europe reduced our incentives as a percent of gross revenues by 15 basis points in fiscal year 2017 and will add almost 50 basis points in fiscal year 2018. This shift, which amounts to around $0.03 of EPS, added 1 percentage point to our EPS growth in fiscal year 2017 and will reduce fiscal year 2018 EPS growth by almost 1 percentage point. We repurchased 16.9 million shares of Visa stock in the fourth quarter or $1.7 billion at an average price of $102.54. In fiscal 2017, we repurchased a total of 76.1 million shares for $6.9 billion at an average price of $90.31. We also paid $1.6 billion in dividends, and our board has authorized an increase of 18% in our quarterly dividend to $0.195 per share. Finally, on September 11, we issued $2.5 billion of fixed rate notes with maturities ranging from 5 to 30 years with a weighted average interest rate of 2.78% and weighted average maturity of 14 years. On October 11, we redeemed $1.75 billion of our December 27 notes. A quick review of the quarter's business drivers and our financial results. U.S. payments volumes grew 9% as credit grew 10% and debit grew 8%. As I mentioned earlier, the step-down in these growth rates was driven by the lapping of Costco and USAA conversions last year. Adjusted for the impact of conversion, underlying credit growth rates have been stable in the high single digits for the past four quarters. Adjusted for Interlink, the U.S. debit growth trend was also stable. Reported debit growth ticked up from the prior quarter due to Interlink, where we are now lapping a routing loss last year. International payments volumes in constant dollars grew 10%, excluding Europe co-badge volumes in all periods. Growth trends remain stable and robust around the globe. Global cross-border volumes grew 10%. It's important to note that cross-border growth hit double digits, normalized for Europe in Q4 2016 for the first time after several weak quarters. The cross-border growth rates held up in the fourth quarter despite tougher comparisons. U.S. cross-border growth is slowing as the dollar weakens as well as some impact from lapping the Costco and USAA conversions. Cross-border growth in Mexico and the Caribbean was impacted by the earthquake and hurricanes. On the other hand, outbound commerce picked up a bit from Europe as the euro and the pound have strengthened. Other currency shifts of the Russian ruble, Japanese yen, the Brazilian real, Aussie and Canadian dollars are also changing the mix of our cross-border business, which will need to be closely monitored. Transactions processed over VisaNet grew 13%, in line with the prior quarter when normalized for Europe. Through October 21, U.S. payments volumes growth was 8.7%, with U.S. credit growing 9.9% and debit, 7.4%. Cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis was up 7.4%. Processed transactions grew 12.6%. Net revenues in Q4 grew 14%. While we have Europe in our prior reported numbers, it is important to note that rebates in Europe continued to be paid through the end of fiscal 2016. Exchange rate shifts helped reported Q4 net revenue growth by less than 50 basis points. Operating expenses were flat to last year, which included severance cost related to the acquisition of Visa Europe and our global restructuring. Adjusted to exclude these special items, operating expenses in Q4 grew 8%, largely driven by personnel costs and expenses related to projects that were delayed into the fourth quarter, particularly in Europe. Personnel costs were higher as hiring picked up post our restructuring in Europe and globally at the end of fiscal year 2016. We also incurred higher incentive accruals as performance exceeded our expectations. Professional fees ramped up in the second half around Europe technology integration as well as other key technology development programs. Our Q4 tax rate was 31%. EPS was $0.90, up 14%. Exchange rate shifts helped reported Q4 EPS growth by almost 1 percentage point. For the full year of fiscal 2017, net revenues were $18.4 billion, up 22% with an approximately 1.5 percentage points negative currency impact. Full year adjusted EPS was $3.48, also up 22% with a currency headwind of over 2 percentage points. With that, I'll move to our outlook for fiscal 2018. The many significant events of fiscal 2017 will have a meaningful impact on year-over-year growth comparisons in fiscal 2018. A few points to highlight before I get into the details. First, unlike fiscal year 2017, fiscal year 2018 will lap a full year of Europe in our reported numbers. While the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 included Europe in both years, the ending of rebates to Visa Europe members did not go into effect until the first quarter of fiscal 2017. So the first quarter of apples-to-apples revenue growth comparisons for Europe is Q1 FY 2018. Second, in Q1 FY 2018, we get close to an apples-to-apples growth comparison for Costco and in Q2 FY 2018 for USAA. Third, the India demonetization impact started in November 2016. As you know, this led to a more than doubling of our India payment volume and processed transaction. We begin to lap this in the latter part of Q1 2018. Fourth, as we indicated, through the first half of fiscal 2017, there were delays in Europe converting contracts to replace rebates with appropriate commercial incentive terms. As such, our client incentives were significantly lower than we had anticipated in the first half of fiscal 2017. As I mentioned earlier, approximately 75% of these contract conversions were resolved by the end of fiscal 2017, and the remainder will be done primarily in the first half of fiscal 2018. As a result, client incentives in the first half of 2018 will be significantly higher than fiscal year 2017, with incentive growth moderating in Q4 2018. Finally, our U.S. price increases went into effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and our international price increases went into effect mostly in the second quarter of 2017. We will lap these price increases in the first half of 2018. Fiscal 2018 price increases are smaller in scope and will go into effect in the second half of the year. All these factors have been incorporated into our outlook for fiscal 2018. They will also impact the quarterly cadence of net revenue and EPS growth. Let me now get into some of the details starting with payment volumes. Payment volumes globally have grown around 10% in constant dollars for the past two years normalized for Europe. Thanks to Costco and USAA, U.S. payment volume growth stepped up to the double-digit range in fiscal 2017 and will tick down to the high single digits in fiscal 2018 as we lap both conversions. International payment volume growth as reported will now reflect Europe in both years. We have been providing payment volume growth rates normalized for Europe in our data pack each quarter. Excluding Europe co-badge volume, normalized constant-dollar international payment volume growth rates were almost 10% in fiscal 2017. We anticipate some moderation in these growth rates in 2018 due to the dual brand run-off in China and the demonetization impact in India. Global second half growth rates are expected to be better than the first half, helped by some smaller conversions in the U.S., the ramping of Visa Direct volume, and lapping the declines in China dual-brand volumes in fiscal 2017. Overall, for fiscal year 2018, our outlook anticipates high single-digit constant-dollar payment volume growth rates globally. Moving on to the cross-border business, cross-border volumes, as you all know, are dependent on global economic conditions and the relative strength of key currencies, in particular the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the pound. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, the strong dollar, weak euro and pound dynamic led to very strong outbound commerce from the U.S. and high inbound commerce into Europe, especially the UK. In the fourth quarter, these trends started to change as the dollar weakened, especially versus the euro and the pound. Assuming these trends continue, we anticipate a slowdown in U.S. outbound commerce, with a step up in growth of commerce coming into the U.S. and vice-versa in Europe and the UK. We're assuming this trend is accentuated through the year if dollar weakness continues. Overall, our outlook anticipates high cross-border growth is sustained in fiscal year 2018, with a change in mix as described. International revenue growth rates are expected to be higher in the second half, when some pricing actions go into effect. The other variable that impacts our international revenues is currency volatility. After high volatility in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 post the Brexit surprise, currency volatility has been subdued through most of 2017. Currency volatility has been running below the long-term mean. For purposes of our outlook, we are assuming that volatility stay at these levels through fiscal year 2018. Normalized to include Europe for the full year, we had healthy double-digit processed transaction growth in fiscal year 2017, helped by the Costco/USAA conversions in the U.S., the impact of India demonetization, and the processing win in Europe in the year. We expect a small step-down in growth rates in fiscal 2018 as we lap these items. We anticipate, however, that transaction growth will remain in the double digits, with generally steady growth through the year. Data processing revenue growth rates are also expected to be higher in the second half, helped by some pricing actions that go into effect. On the client incentive front, we ended the year with incentives in the fourth quarter as a percent of gross revenues at 21.7%. Our outlook for fiscal 2018 is a range of 21.5% to 22.5%. Client incentives in the first half of 2017 averaged 18.8%, well below our expectations going into the year, primarily due to the delays in Europe. In the third quarter, this climbed to 20% as Europe contract activity picked up steam, finishing at 21.7% in Q4, which included several significant renewals in Russia and China. With all the renewal activity in the second half of 2017, client incentive growth will be substantially higher in the first half of fiscal 2018, moderating significantly by the fourth quarter. This will be further compounded by two major renewals we currently anticipate will be completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as well as the completion of Europe rebate-to-incentive contract conversions, which have shifted into the first half of 2018. The Europe rebate-to-incentive contract conversions that shifted from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 lowered FY 2017 incentives as a percent of gross revenues by 50 basis points and correspondingly increased fiscal 2018 incentives as a percent of gross revenues by almost 50 basis points. When you put this all together, our outlook is for high single-digit nominal net revenue growth in fiscal 2018, which includes the currency translation tailwind of between 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Net revenue growth in the first half is anticipated to be a couple of points below the full-year run rate and in the double digits in the second half. Net revenue growth is expected to be highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the second quarter. This is a result of all the factors I just went through. In terms of currency translation tailwind of 50 basis points to 100 basis points, the dollar is not weakening across all currencies. We're benefiting from dollar weakness most significantly versus the euro. As a reminder, since the euro is a functional currency, we do not hedge our exposure to the euro. Relative to the pound, weakness of the dollar hurts revenues, but this is largely offset by the expenses we have denominated in pounds. The dollar is also weaker versus other important currencies like the Canadian and Australian dollar. As you know, we hedge some of our exposure to these currencies, which offset losses when they weaken and vice-versa. The dollar, however, remains strong or continues to strengthen versus the yen and a broad range of emerging market currencies like the Argentinian peso. We are unhedged on many of these emerging market currencies since they cannot be economically hedged. The net impact of all this is the 50 to 100 basis point impact we currently estimate based on spot rates and forward curves. As always, currencies will fluctuate. On the expense front, we're investing in a set of key initiatives that Al described, by partially funding these investments, by shifting resources from lower priority areas, as well as from savings we derive from better purchasing and other efficiency programs. In aggregate, fiscal 2018 operating expense growth adjusted for special items in fiscal year 2017 is projected to be in the mid-single-digit range. Included in our expenses is another $60 million in non-recurring cost related to the technology integration of Visa Europe. In fiscal 2018, we expect to start migrating clients to the global Visa technology platform. We have also included expenses related to getting our processing infrastructure up and running in China. Of course, it remains difficult to predict exactly what the timing will be on incurring these China expenses. Expense growth cadence through the year will also not be uniform. Adjusted expense growth will be in the high single digits in the first half and the low single digits in the second half due to various factors. Coming out of our organization restructuring at Visa Europe and globally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, personnel expenses were low in the first quarter of 2017 and ramped up through the year. In addition, bonus accruals stepped up through the year as it became apparent that business performance was exceeding our expectations. We have the Winter Olympics in the second quarter, which will result in higher marketing expenses versus Q2 last year. The Europe integration cost is also first half loaded as we complete the technology platform harmonization and start client migration. Finally, many of our investment initiatives ramped up through the second half of fiscal 2017, and spend rates on these initiatives will be higher in the first half of fiscal 2018 than they were in the first half of last year. The adjusted expense growth rate is expected to be highest in the first quarter and the lowest in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Our adjusted tax rate in 2017 was almost 30%, helped by the part-year benefits from the legal entity reorganization we completed midyear. Our outlook projects 100 basis points reduction in our tax rate for fiscal 2018 since we will get the full year benefit of the tax reorganization. This tax rate outlook does not include any impact from possible tax reform. Putting all these components together, our outlook is for EPS growth at the high end of mid-teens on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis. This includes 1 to 1.5 points of positive foreign currency translation impact. As mentioned earlier, the underspend on client incentives in Europe with some renewal shifting into FY 2018 added approximately 1 percentage point to EPS growth in fiscal 2017 and will reduce EPS growth by almost 1 percentage point in fiscal 2018. With net revenue and operating expense growth rates fluctuating from quarter-to-quarter, EPS growth rates will, too. The EPS growth rate based on all these assumptions will be lowest in the second quarter, below the low end of the mid-teens range and at the highest level for the year in the fourth quarter, well above the mid-teens range. In the first and third quarters, we anticipate mid-teens EPS growth. We know all this quarterly fluctuation does not make it easy for you to build your model. We wanted to give you as much color as we could, and we'll, of course, update our outlook each quarter as we normally do as well as provide a point of view on the upcoming quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our outlook is for net revenue growth a couple of points below the full year rate, high single-digit operating expense growth and mid-teens adjusted EPS growth. Moving on to capital, cash flow, dividends and buybacks. Capital spending in fiscal 2018 is likely to be around $800 million. This includes capital associated with the Europe technology integration, capital to set up processing operations in China and spending on hardware to support growth as well as capitalization of software from our technology development projects. Based on our earnings outlook and capital spending, free cash flow from operations is anticipated to be in excess of $9 billion. Most of this free cash flow will be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. The Visa board has authorized an 18% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.195 for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In line with our stated dividend policy, this puts our payout ratio in the 20% to 25% range. We anticipate buying back over $7 billion of Visa stock during fiscal 2018. As you know, we've been buying stock in excess of our normal buybacks from free cash flow since the Visa Europe acquisition to neutralize the impact from stock issued to Visa Europe members. In fiscal 2018, we will complete this aspect of our buyback program. As I mentioned earlier, we issued $2.5 billion in debt in three tranches with a weighted average maturity of 14 years. After redeeming our December 2017 two-year notes, gross debt now stands at $16.75 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio is in the 1.2x to 1.5x range we are targeting, but towards the lower end of the range as EBITDA has grown. Since we stretched out maturities and added some indebtedness, interest expense will increase 10% in fiscal 2018. After we completed our legal entity reorganization, we have returned a net $5 billion in offshore cash to the U.S. At the end of September, total cash on hand including marketable securities stood at $15.3 billion. This includes cash from the September debt issue. We used $1.5 billion of this cash in October to redeem all of our two-year notes. We're monitoring developments from the tax reform front as we develop strategies to return more cash back to the U.S. We will adopt the new revenue recognition standard on October 1, 2018, the beginning of our fiscal 2019. If applied to fiscal 2017 reported results, the impact of the new standard would have been immaterial. The impact to future years is partially dependent on the terms of new incentive deals executed going forward and will, therefore, vary. We will continue to assess the impact of the new standard throughout fiscal 2018 and provide you an update if we believe that the application of the new standard to new deals in aggregate could have a more significant impact on reported results. As a reminder, the new accounting standard has no impact on cash flows or the economic value of our business. In summary, the power of the Visa business model enhanced by the acquisition of Visa Europe delivered 22% net revenue and adjusted EPS growth in fiscal year 2017. Europe contributed with mid-single-digit EPS accretion. At the end of the first year post-acquisition, Visa Europe is well ahead of our revenue projection, below our cost projection with a lower effective tax rate. If we achieve the goals we have for Europe in fiscal year 2018, cumulative EPS accretion will be in the high single digits, and operating margins will be at or above Visa Inc. margins. We're poised to deliver another year of the robust revenue and earnings growth we have come to expect from Visa while continuing to invest in our business at healthy levels to sustain this growth into the future.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: And with that, we're ready to take questions, Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you, good morning. I appreciate all the color on 2018, Vasant. I was just wondering if you could talk about what your expectations are for Visa Europe's accretion in 2018. And when we think about sort of where the surprises could be, it sounded like in 2017, it was on the expenses. Should we assume like in 2018, it could be more on the pricing side? Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Yes. As I mentioned, it was sort of mid-single digits accretion in 2017 and cumulatively getting to the high single digits, so you could say once again, it adds probably in a low single digits accretion in 2018, so generally in that ballpark. So as you know, that's ahead of where we expected to be at this stage. No, I would say as Al said to that, 2017 performance was driven as much by revenue as expenses. So the revenue picture has been strong in Europe for two reasons. The local economies, they have been strong, and cross-border was particularly strong in Europe in 2017 because of the weak pound and the euro, a lot of cross border into the U.K. especially. And as we look at 2018, the economic situation in Europe at least as we look at it still looks very strong at a local level and the cross-border business is holding up. So it's going to be, again, I think revenue being a major driver of it. I don't know, Al, if you have something else.\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: No, I think that's fair. I think as I said, we're bullish on Europe, and I think it's a combination of what we're getting done on the revenue side and the expense side.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: And of course, we got the legal entity reorganization done, which meant that the effective tax rate on our European earnings is lower than what we might have expected immediately post the transaction.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just wanted to follow up on that. The high single-digit EPS accretion by 2018, that will be two years earlier than the original plan. I think it was for high single digits by fiscal year 2020. Just thinking about going forward into 2019 and 2020, is there some upside now to the original guidance on EPS accretion in Europe now that we're ahead of plan and there is probably more to do in the out-years? Thanks.\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: Bryan, I think we're, at this point, laser beam focused on 2018 and trying to take this in one step at a time. I think we feel very good about where we ended 2017. We feel very good about where we think we're going to head in 2018. And hopefully, there's a trend there. But right now, we're focused on 2018 and getting to that next step in terms of the value that Europe is delivering to the entire Visa enterprise.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks, good morning. So I had a question on the high 60s margin guidance for 2018. I appreciate all the expense color you guys gave. Historically, that's been a mid-60s number. And the question really is the business model at a kind of pivot point, whereby you really just can't kind of outrun the incremental margin anymore with really the pace of investment or is this just kind of a one-off, where we're going to be running in the high 60s? Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: I think as we've always said, we don't have margins as an objective. We focus on driving volumes. Clearly, the focus is on converting cash, driving volumes, driving revenues. As long as revenues are growing in the high single digits and with the appropriate level of investment given the nature of our cost structure, expenses are growing in the mid-single digits, you're going to get margin improvement. And margins are not an objective. It's an outcome. And Al?\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: I think the only other dynamic I'd remind you of, Dan, is that we're seeing based on the actions we're taking fairly good margin expansion in Europe, which is now a part of the overall mix of the margin number for all of Visa. But other than that, I would agree totally with Vasant's comment, which is we're going to invest at the level that makes sense and we feel good about and margins as an outcome, not a goal.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nDonald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. Al, sort of a longer-term question. If you look around the world at what's going on with Alipay and real-time payments, at some point, do you get worried that there could be some leakage to the secular opportunity or do you feel like that is something that's premature in terms of worrying about?\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: Don, I think a good characteristic of any CEO is to be a bit paranoid. And while we just talked about very, very strong results in FY 2017, I can tell you that we are really laser-focused on the future and the fact that there are disruptive forces in the marketplace. I think that as it relates to real-time payments, I think we feel like we've got a very good tool in our toolbox in terms of Visa Direct. And as I said in my remarks, we saw volume on Visa Direct rise 75% year over year. The likes of Alipay and WeChat have done a phenomenal job in China and have started to migrate to other geographies. And you can rest assured that it is something that we pay a tremendous amount of attention to, and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that we remain a key player at the focal point of the payments ecosystem.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nJason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. I just wanted to ask on cross-border. Can you walk us through the reconciling items in Q4 between volume growth and revenue growth? At least in our model, the big revenue upside was on cross-border. And then just any thoughts or comments around the intra-quarter cross-border volume slowdown through October 21? I know it's only a few weeks of data, but any callouts there? Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to as far as the volume and revenue growth aspects of the fourth quarter. There was nothing unusual in the fourth quarter. It was a pretty steady growth quarter. There should not be anything unusual there unless I'm not fully understanding your question. As far as it relates to the first three weeks of October, we've said over and over again in the past that three weeks don't make a trend. Having said that, why is the number 7.4%? There's a little bit of shift in what are these intra-Europe cross-border volumes that accounts for probably 1.5 points or so of the difference from last quarter. Intra-Europe, sometimes acquirers and merchants can shift where they acquire the volume, and that can cause something that was considered an intra-Europe transaction to a domestic transaction. It doesn't have much of a revenue impact, but we do see that within the EU. The other factors are really driven more by a strengthening dollar causing some slowdowns, as I said in my comments, on outbound commerce from the U.S. and some limited impact from what's happening in the Caribbean and Mexico. But again, there's a lot going on in cross-border with these currency shifts, and we'll just have to wait and see. We feel pretty good about it.\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: The only thing I'd add is again, a small impact, but it's the lapping of some of the U.S. conversions.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nLisa Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Al, just a question about Europe. You gave pretty bullish commentary on the outlook for Europe, and in particular highlighting the disparity across countries there with card penetration or digital payment penetration. But that is the region also where there is prevalence in some countries of these bank transfer-based networks that have gotten a lot of traction. Can you walk through your view on how debit goes head to head versus these networks? What's the difference in functionality? What's the difference in the value proposition to the merchant, to the issuer, et cetera?\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: Lisa, thank you for the question. I think I mentioned I'm heading to London right after this call, and this is actually something that's on our agenda to discuss. The issue you raise is real. I think in the case of Europe, as a reminder, the bulk of our business or a large percentage of our business is in the UK. And as we actually look to penetrate further into the continent, we're going to have to make sure that we have strong offerings in credit as well as debit. And we, by the way, tend to be even further behind in credit in some markets than we are in the case of debit. And we're going to have to make sure that our value propositions are differentiated in certain ways to make sure that we are indeed a player. But there's no question that these country-based networks are something we're going to have to contend with.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys. A two-part question, but first, I understand you have more tough compares in 2018, including higher incentives as a catch-up, but fourth quarter did sow some of that increase in incentives already obviously, and yet you were able to do 14% growth. So just are the other factors like pricing enough for the difference down to high single digits in guide? And then just a longer-term part of the question is, I guess incentives are guided up again. If we took out the idea of a catch-up, again, bigger picture, should investors expect a more normalized growth in incentives after 2018 just based on pricing environment seeming to be somewhat stable in the overall market? So just bigger picture comments on incentives growth after the catch-up.\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: In the case of the first question, the guidance we're giving is our best assessment of where we see the business going at this point in time for 2018 with all of the various information that we have at our hands. In terms of the client incentives question, Vasant?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: On the first part of your question, which is your revenue growth was 14% despite incentives being 21.7%, I just want to make sure you heard what I said about the fact that in the fourth quarter of 2017, while we were lapping Europe in 2016, the rebates were still in place in the fourth quarter of 2016. So it's not apples-to-apples yet for Europe on the revenue front because the rebates stop being paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. So you really only have to get out of the first quarter of 2017 where you're comparing Europe one year to the other in a real apples-to-apples way. That's number one. Number two, we went through some of the Costco/USAA comparatives. So there are a couple of factors that make the fourth quarter that we just had have things in it that are not going to be like what you've seen in the first quarter and beyond next year. As it relates to incentives, yes, some of it is the shift. But as you know, we just went through in Europe a large number of what we call contract conversions from rebates to incentives. All those now flow through the incentive line next year, so clearly that's a factor. And then we had, as you heard, several large renewals this year. That flows through. And we don't really want to comment on what happens in 2019 and beyond. But as Al said, we've given you the best picture we can of what to expect in 2018.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe touch on the data processing line. That line has consistently done better than we expected. And I think on the last call, Vasant, you referred to the fact that you had picked up some specific wins. Can you maybe just kind of frame that line and the expectations for 2018 and beyond in terms of where you might be thinking of market share, in what regions and if Europe is specifically a possibility for further share gains there?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Yeah. I wouldn't emphasize share gains per se. Yes, we had a gain in Europe, which did help the growth rate in that line. But data processing has been a very healthy business. It's a great business. As I think Al mentioned, we would like to increase processing around the world. It has been growing in that 13% range all year while clearly having Costco and USAA come in the U.S. helped that, too. As we look ahead, we said we'd see a little bit of a step-down because of these lapping effects but still healthy double-digit growth. Beyond that, there really wasn't anything remarkable there. It's just a good, strong, fast growth business.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette. Your line is now open. One moment please.\nJames E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: ...with regulators in Europe has been...\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: I'm sorry. You just came in with the first part of the question. Can you start again?\nJames E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. Hey. This is James Faucette, Morgan Stanley. Al, it's a question for you. You mentioned in your prepared comments that your engagement with regulators perhaps is most active in Europe, and I'm wondering if you can just give a little bit of color as to what you view as the objectives of the regulators in Europe and the pieces that Visa can have that can help address the things that regulators are looking at. And I guess, as part of that, just give an update as to what you're seeing with your partners as \u2013 with PSD2, et cetera. Thanks.\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: So I think there's a number of objectives that the regulators have. They're looking for \u2013 to protect the privacy of consumers. They're looking to make sure that transactions are as secure as they possibly can be. They're looking to create and foster more innovation and allowing FinTechs to get into the stream a bit more, and that's facilitating the idea of opening up access to bank accounts around Europe as defined in PSD2. So I think that what the regulators are trying to accomplish is relatively clear. I think where it all lands and what the various use cases that might develop is probably less clear. We focus on a couple of things. One is making sure that we are having good open dialog with the regulators so that they understand our point of views and have clarity around what exists that's good in the payments ecosystem and how the payments ecosystem is evolving. Secondly, we're working closely with our clients, particularly issuers and acquirers, around Europe to understand what are some of the implications and frankly, what are potentially some of the opportunities, making sure that we help them as they try to meet the authentication hurdles that the regulators want people to achieve as well as understanding the implications of PSD2 and open access to accounts and what that might mean. And I think we have found ourselves having excellent dialog with clients throughout Europe, and it's something that we'll be continuing to focus on. I actually will meet with regulators tomorrow when I'm in London.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: And with that, we'd like to thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has follow-up questions, please feel free to call myself or Joon. Thanks, again. Have a great day.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Jack, thank you, and good afternoon to everybody and thanks for joining us today. We had another strong quarter of business results much like the first half of our fiscal year we saw a consistently solid trends in our operating metrics with very good growth in payments volume, process transactions and cross border revenue. Our global business benefitted from an overall healthy economy as payments volume grew in every major region. In the United States we saw strong consumer confidence continue to drive spending growth. After three quarters here at Visa, I\u2019m quite pleased with our business progress and our high level of execution. It\u2019s a real testimony to our talented and dedicated employees around the world for creating a strong culture focussed on leadership development, operational excellence and driving results. As I move to the highlights of the quarter, I do want to thank everybody for joining us at our recent Investor Day both in person and via the webcast. As the leadership team we enjoyed the opportunity to meet and spend time with our shareholders and the financial community. We hope that you find the information and discussions to be useful. We were pleased to have received quite positive and helpful feedback from the event, given the fact that we did provide a significant amount of information just a couple of weeks ago my prepared remarks today will be relatively brief. In Q3 our business continued to perform well against our operating plan and our strategic priorities for the year. We saw healthy growth in our key metrics for payments, volume and process transaction. Payment volume was solid across all five regions. Growth was particularly strong in India, the United States, Russia, Mexico and Australia. China payments volume growth remained low in the quarter driven by the dual currency, dual badged card run-off. But I should note that China\u2019s cross border volumes growth continued to be strong. This was reflective of the overall trend as cross border growth was robust around the globe. In addition to China, Latin America, the U.S. Japan, Russia and parts of Europe were among the areas of real strength. Looking closer at process transactions growth was driven by Asia Pacific, Europe and the North America regions. Client incentives came in lower than expected primarily driven by timing delays and variances relative to our European clients. This translated to financial performance ahead of our expectations for the quarter as we grew both net revenue and EPS by 26% versus last year\u2019s comparable results. Vasant will go into greater financial detail and cover some of the normalized comparisons to last year. As we mentioned during Investor Day the integration of our European business is progressing well and is on track. More specific to the technology side of the integration we are focussed on migrating the European systems to our global authorisation clearing and settlement system as well as deploying our global data platform and other corporate systems into Europe. We are well underway in that effort and we have just completed the upgrade of our U.K. data center is on schedule. We expect that client migrations to the new systems will begin by the end of full year 2018. In moving our European clients to VisaNet we confirm pride enhanced network capabilities greater scale, resilience and additional levels of cyber security that will benefit our clients and certainly be more efficient in the long term. We are also making significant progress in strengthening our partnerships and building digital capabilities to drive growth. Earlier this week, we extended our partnership with PayPal to include Europe. We were already collaborating with them in the United States and Asia Pacific to provide a better online experience and this now extends the benefits to European consumers and businesses. Additionally, they have joined the Visa network of clients, financial institutions and will be able to offer Visa accounts in Europe enabling consumers in businesses to use their PayPal funds to spend wherever Visa is accepted. The partnership makes it easier for financial institutions to offer their Visa account holders the ability to check out anywhere PayPal is accepted online by offering greater consumer choice. We also announced a strategic investment and planned partnership with Klarna, one of Europe\u2019s leading payment providers. Our planned investment is part of the global strategy to open up our ecosystem and support a broad range of new partners or helping to redefine and enhance the purchase experience for consumers online and in mobile environment. Klarna develops products that address changing consumer preferences giving them the flexibility and seamless experience that they expect and hope for when shopping online. In June, we signed 13 new partners to participate in our token service provider program in all major regions. With the expected increase in digital payments embedded in a growing number of devices we continue to build out a global network of partners to offer secure, digital payment token services in creating a more secure commerce platform. We launched the Visa Ready Program for Business Solutions. This is a strategic framework in solidification [ph] program to help technology companies that integrate with our B2B payment services to ensure that they meet standards and are market ready. Five initial partners in the U.S. have become Visa Ready as this program will help accelerate growth and enable new used cased for B2B payments. Turning to the international markets, let me first make a couple of comments on China. Yesterday we filed an application with the People\u2019s Bank of China in order to participate in the China domestic market as a bank card clearing institution. China is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing payments markets and is leading the way in payments innovation. Our commitment to this market is long term. We look forward to bringing our capabilities to the industry by stepping up our engagement with all the ecosystem partners to open a constructive collaboration aiming to create added value and introduce innovative products as well as reliable and safe payment experiences for Chinese consumers. We expect that the PDOC will consider our application inline with the publicly released measures and guidelines for PCCI applicants. India represents a large opportunity and we provided some thoughts during Investor Day on how we are approaching the market. We are seeing steady progress with digital payments despite the recent remonetisation of cash, currency and circulation is stabilizing as remonetisation comes to an end. The transition to the digital economy has been broad based across several categories including everyday spend and suggests wide societal participation. This past quarter we saw payments volume increase over 80% and process transactions more than double versus last year. In a couple of weeks I\u2019ll be in India for the first time since joining Visa and I look forward to seeing firsthand the opportunity that we have in meeting with local partners, officials and our team mates in India. Once again we delivered on our commitment to drive value for our shareholders in the quarter in maintaining a prudent capital allocation plan. We invested in support of the growth in our core business through capital spending and expenses. In fiscal Q3, we returned approximately $2.1 billion of capital to shareholders consisting of $1.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly $400 million through dividends. We continue to accelerate our share buyback activity to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction. In closing, we continue to see strong momentum in the business and we are excited about the long term growth prospects to Visa. As we highlighted during Investor Day there is a significant opportunity to displace cash and cheque of $17 trillion in front of us. We will continue to focus on partnering strategically and driving digital innovation to substantially grow our business into the future. With that, let me now turn the call over to Vasant for some more on the financials.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Business momentum stayed strong globally through our third quarter. Net revenue and EPS once again exceeded our expectations. Fiscal third quarter net revenue of $4.6 million was up 26%. Net income for the quarter was $2.1 billion or $0.86 per share. Adjusting last year\u2019s results were several special items related to the acquisition of Visa Europe, both net income and EPS were up 26%. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted net revenue growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points and EPS by approximately 2 percentage points. A few points to note, global growth rates and payment volumes processed transactions and cross border volumes remain strong and stable. Exchange rate headwinds moderated, though currency volatilities remained below the long term mean. Timing of client incentives added almost $0.02 to third quarter results due to delays primarily in Europe, more on this later. We brought back 17.8 million shares of Class A common stock for $1.7 billion in the third quarter at an average price of $93.82. Year-to-date in fiscal 2017 we\u2019ve bought back 59.2 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $86.82 per share. A quick review of our key business drivers in the third quarter. U.S. payments volume grew 12% with credit growing 19% and debit 5%. The slowdown in credit growth from the prior quarter reflects the start of COFCO and U.S. AA Credit conversion in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding Interlink, debit grew 9%. Declining gas prices negatively impacted payment volume by half a point. Adjusted for conversion and gas prices, underlying credit and debit growth rates have been stable all year. As reported, international payment volume grew 72% in constant dollars. On a comparable and normalized basis, robust payment volume growth continued across the globe. Asia sustained double digit growth rate excluding China. Domestic payment volume growth in China was impacted by the decline in active dual branded cards. Strong growth was sustained across EMEA and Latin America business picked up modestly. In Europe, excluding core batch payment volumes growth was 9% with strength across most markets. ON a constant dollar basis, cross border volumes grew 147% driven by the inclusion of Europe. Adding Europe to prior results, constant dollar cross border growth was up over 11%. Through the quarter the dollar weakened and the pound strengthened moderately. Despite these shifts outbound commerce from the U.S. and inbound commerce into the U.K. remained very strong. U.S. cross border growth accelerated in the third quarter largely driven by out-bound commerce. The cross international markets particularly strong corridors were inbound into Canada, Japan and Australia and outbound from Latin America the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia. Reported cross border volume growth rates were negatively impacted by over three percentage points by an e-commerce payments platform shifting acquiring of U.K. cardholder volume to the U.K. from another yield location. While this shift impacted our reported cross border growth rates, it has a minor effect on revenue since this is an intra EU move the platform made to optimize the European business. As reported, process transactions grew 44% due to the inclusion of Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis which includes Europe in prior results global process transactions grew 13%. U.S. growth rates were stable, international growth rates were helped by India and some new business in Europe. India process transaction growth stayed above 100%. Through July 14, U.S. payment volumes are up 10%, global constant dollar across border volumes grew 12%, and process transaction growth was 14%. A brief review of fiscal third quarter financial results. With strong momentum in the key business drivers and helped by some moderation in exchange rate headwinds, growth rates on all key revenue lines stepped up in Q3. Service revenues grew 19%, data processing revenues grew 29%, international revenues grew 45% even as currency volatility stayed below the long term mean As I mentioned earlier, client incentives came in lower than expected and added almost $0.02 to the third quarter EPS. This was primarily due to delays in Europe. We are making good progress in resetting our commercial terms for key clients post removal of rebids [ph]. We are pushing hard to get most of the deals we want it done before the end of this fiscal year. Our current expectation is we will get 75% to 80% of the way there by September. At this point, we expect the remaining 20% to 25% to shift into fiscal 2018 largely due to client preferences and time tables. This shift in Europe is the primary reason why we now expect client incentive as a percent of gross revenues to come in below the low end of our original outlook range of 20.5% to 21.5%. After adjusting for various special items in last year\u2019s results, expenses grew 31%. As expected expense growth ramped up from the first half levels as we stepped up technology as well as Europe integration spending. Our tax rate was 29.3% driven by the geographic mix of our global learning and the benefits of the legal entity re-organization we completed last quarter. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, it\u2019s important to remind you of three events that occurred in June 2016 which will significantly impact our reported growth rates on key metrics going forward. First and foremost and the most important is the closing of the Visa Europe transaction. Starting with the fourth quarter, reported growth rates will include Visa Europe and all prior year numbers. Second is the COFCO conversion. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 our U.S. credit growth rates will include COFCO in prior year numbers. In addition, the U.S. AA Credit conversion was completed in September and the debit conversion was finished by October last year. Third is the 2016 Brexit vote followed by sharp declines in the Pound and later the Euro. This will reduce the exchange rate drag we have experienced so far this year. This also drove the sharp increase of cross border commerce into the U.K. Also of note, the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 was the first time cross border growth rates globally hit double digits in almost three years. Starting in the fourth quarter we will begin to lap the global cross border recovery. We have factored all this into our updated outlook for the year. We are raising nominal net revenue growth expectations for the year to approximately 20%. This is a result of the strong growth we have reported to date, lower client incentives at 20% to 20.5% of gross revenues and moderation in the exchange rate drag to approximately 2 percentage points. With higher revenue growth we are also raising a nominal adjusted EPS growth outlook to approximately 20% with a 2.5 percentage point exchange rate drag. Included in this outlook is a reduction in European integration cost of $60 million. Margin and tax rate expectation remain unchanged. Finally, a couple of updates on cash and debt. We returned more cash to the U.S. in the third quarter. Year-to-date we have returned approximately $4 billion back to the U.S. As you know in December 2016 we issued $16 billion of debt. The first tranche of this debt $1.7 billion matures in December this year. Between Labor Day and December, we plan to access debt markets to refinance maturing debt and an additional amount to fund the completion of stock buybacks that neutralize the impact of stock issued in connection with the Visa Europe acquisition. Before I finish, I have one more topic. A couple of weeks back, Jack informed me of his intention to retire at the end of this year. On behalf of Visa\u2019s management I want to thank Jack for his decade of contributions to Visa. As most of you know Jack was Visa\u2019s first IR leader as the public company. Jack built our investor relations department from the ground up establishing and nurturing relationships with all of you over the years and he has been a key advocate for Visa. We [Indiscernible] which he tells me may include running the town chairlift and Park city next winter. Not surprisingly he has picked November 30th as his last day. I guess he does not want to miss a single day skiing. With that, let me turn this back to Jack.\nJack Carsky: Thanks Vasant. And before we start the Q&A, let me just add to Vasant\u2019s very nice comments there. It\u2019s been a real honor and privilege working for this organization and the people in it for the last 10 years. But it\u2019s always good to go out on top. I\u2019d known a lot of you for as ten years and some of you for as many as 20. And it\u2019s been a great ride and I really enjoy the interactions with each and every one of you. And so with that, Jenny we are ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line is open.\nBob Napoli: Jack I know that Visa stock has gone up too much and you are too rich, so it\u2019s not a big surprise here, so I hope to take the ski lift that you\u2019ll be running. But....\nJack Carsky: [Indiscernible] he doesn\u2019t need a lift.\nBob Napoli: No it\u2019s great, congratulations. But just, I guess I mean the numbers have been very good obviously to Investor Day I think the company seem pretty upbeat. I just wanted if there is a way that as you look at your numbers if you can split out the growth and tell has there been acceleration in the secular shift away from cash and cheques to electronic payments. I know there\u2019s a lot going on with market share in COFCO and different things, but I just wanted if you look at that, if there is a way if you think there\u2019s been in some acceleration in secular trends.\nAl Kelly: Yes, if you \u2013 I think as I said in my comments if you start to take out the conversions and adjust for gas prices and volatile things like that, the underlying trend of credit growth in the U.S. for the last three quarters has been very steady and stable in the high single-digit, and debt growth have also been very steady and stable. If you look at our payments volumes through the first three quarters of this year, again strong and stable. We have been converting cash to digital at a pretty hefty clip for the past five years and I would said there is no \u2013 there\u2019s really no change in that trend. Global economies recovering have clearly helped of this year, so if you remember on Investor Day we talked about PCE penetration and PCE growth, the PCE growth component certainly has been helpful. And then the last thing of course is the recovery on the cross-border side. And Al I don\u2019t know if you want to add.\nAl Kelly: Now I think the other aspect -- all what Vasant said is obviously correct. I think that while we\u2019ve seen a real adoption of digital we\u2019re still in the early innings. And I think that, as we pointed out in Investor Day when we get into E&M commerce we neutralize our largest competitor which is cash, and I think that's going to continue to be a real engine of growth for us as we look ahead.\nBob Napoli: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nMoshe Katri: Hey, thanks. So another quarter of very strong results internationally. It seems that Visa Europe has been exceeding at least our expectations to almost every quarter since the transaction kind of took place. Is there any way to kind of get us some color in terms of where you seeing the upside coming from versus original expectations? And then, on top of that I think you've indicated that the yields from renewing some of that book of business has been better than expected, maybe some more color on that as well. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: I think we\u2019ve been very pleased with Europe on a number of fronts, and especially given the fact that there's been a fair amount of disruption for the people who work in that business between the integration as well as the regulatory requirement to split scheme and processing in the marketplace. Our employees have remained incredibly resilient. And I think in general the European economy has been frankly better than we thought. As you know where our largest presence by quite a large measure is in the UK and the UK is held up well and as Vasant said in his remarks, benefited -- benefited from the lower value of the pound driving lots of inbound traffic into the UK, that certainly has helped. And when we look around the rest of Europe, our largest presences are in France and Spain which have also held up well. And then we\u2019re seeing countries like the Nordics continue to do well. In terms of the yield side of it we\u2019re still working our way through redoing of these contracts, as both of us alluded to in our remarks, its just a bit more of a slog to get there than we might have thought or hoped in the in the first place. But we are making good progress. I think we\u2019ll continue to make good progress as we proceed through into the fourth quarter and to the degree that we've got good incentives built in place and we\u2019re getting good volume growth, all boats rise, which is a good thing for everybody.\nMoshe Katri: And Vasant indicated -- pointed to some new business in Europe? Is there anything substantial there?\nVasant Prabhu: No. I had said that on the process transaction side, yes, we\u2019ve been saying for a couple of quarters that we had some gains in Europe on the process transaction side. But overall as Al said, I mean, we\u2019re very pleased with the way the \u2013 the vast majority of our business in Europe is under contract, and we have been for a certain portion of that working with clients to reset commercial terms once rebates went away and that's gone well longer than we would have liked, but it's going well. So, on all fronts Europe has done, as we\u2019ve said before equal to or better than we expected. And from an accretion standpoint certainly has been performing better than we expected and we\u2019ll give you a little more about that once we are through with the year and can give you a full sense of the year.\nMoshe Katri: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJim Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and good luck to you Jack in your future endeavors. I guess, my question really comes down to the cross-border, obviously the volume is holding in there, but at least by our calculations it looks like the cross-border yield improved somewhat. So, can you maybe give us a sense of whether that's correct and if so what drove it? Was it regional mix? Was there some pricing impact or was it one of wins you just referred to?\nAl Kelly: No. I don't think you should conclude that there was an improvement in yield necessarily. I mean, clearly from quarter to quarter there are some changes in mix and so on. Some of it could be as you see the exchange rate had been moderating a bit certainly that helps our reported cross-border dollar numbers. But there was nothing -- there was no real change that would drive a big change in yields in the cross-border business.\nJim Schneider: And maybe you could also just kind of address the incentive levels and you talked about being almost 80% of the way there by the time you finish this fiscal year. Can you maybe just address directionally where those incentive levels would go in terms of normalizing as we headed into 2018?\nAl Kelly: Yes. We\u2019ll talk about that when we talk about 2018. We\u2019re not \u2013 I mean, if your question was what\u2019s the likely range of incentives or the percent of gross revenues and all that next year. I think we can get into all that when we talk about 2018, so its little too early to talk about all that right now. I think all we were signaling was that there is going to be some shift in Europe of incentives from what we thought we would get done this year into next year. And I want to emphasize that is driven more by client preferences and timetables and their desire to do things on a certain timetable than ours, and we\u2019re adapting to their requirements.\nJim Schneider: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you, Jack. Congrats my friend. It\u2019s been fun. I guess a question I don\u2019t want to ask \u2013 should I think which one to ask. Okay. So, the -- maybe just the change in guidance. Can you just walk us through the change in guidance? How much of it is incentives versus some other factors. And the change to the incentive outlook, is at all timing or do you anticipate paying little bit less than what you previously forecast?\nAl Kelly: Well, there\u2019s a little bit of let's call it better than expected execution, a little bit of it in Europe, but you should think of it as almost all timing and almost all Europe. So that's one contributor. The three factors that went into sort of the change in the outlook is the performance we\u2019ve had to-date, some moderation in the exchange rate headwind, some reduction in the original expectation on incentive. And on the EPS side it reflects the benefits we\u2019re getting from the tax rate we now have which we talked about last quarter, as well as the revenue being stronger than we had thought at the beginning of the year. So, there's no \u2013 there\u2019s nothing unusual other than the actual results and the trends we\u2019re seeing.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Thank you.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Tien-Tsin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, guys and congratulations Jack, we\u2019re going to miss your special sense of humor. I was -- I had a follow-up question also on incentives kind going on Tien-Tsin question which is simply that as we sort of \u2013 as incentives -- the expected level kind of get pushed out, does it increase the chances of sort of incremental volatility and outline? Will there be a quarter coming up where we get a sort of a snapback there and it catches folks by surprise or should you do just they sort of push out and imply kind of a gradual slope?\nJack Carsky: Again, I\u2019d just remind everybody that this -- there are at least three factors that go into this that make this somewhat difficult to predict. And I think we\u2019ve shown how difficult it is to predict, because we haven\u2019t hit the number in the last couple quarters, but it\u2019s the -- when is the deal going to actually come to pass? What are going to be the terms of the deal as you actually get in to the last bits of negotiation? And then, what actually volumes are you going to get against those negotiated terms. So, the reality is, in this particular case it just that the period of time to get through over a 100 client contract is just taking longer than we thought. I don't think we want to get into predicting business or forecasting business or what it would look like quarter by quarter, but I think this is just simply a matter of a process that we have to get through and as Vasant said we\u2019re hoping to get through at about 80% of it by the end of the fiscal year.\nVasant Prabhu: And as we\u2019ve told you before, I mean, its not something we think should be focused on to the extent it is on a quarter by quarter basis. And as you know we explicitly don't try to get deals done based on quarterly timetables and so on. So the short answer to your question is that a snapback kind of thing? No. But is there likely to be a quarter where incentives run higher than we might have expected. Of course, I means just as they\u2019ve run lower than we expected in some quarters and some quarters they could run higher than we expected. But that isn\u2019t any snapback kind of reasons that you should expect. We typically look ahead and give you our better sense of what might get done in the quarter coming up.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nVasant Prabhu: Thanks, Ramsey.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Nice guys. Just first of all, Jack, congrats again. We\u2019ll catch up soon, but we\u2019re going to miss obviously. Just on the higher level now, if you can just touch again, I mean on the pricing environment a bit more you know again you commented on yields coming in better in Europe since the deal, and we've seen a number of years were obviously incentives and rebates have been higher both as a percentage of gross revenues on a year-to-year basis. It feels like at some point on the gross yield side it's going higher, but the rebate side is keeping up pace to some extent that you would see a bit of a divergence between the two. I mean, is there anything you can comment on conceptually and what you're seeing in your conversations with clients? Has there been more of a realization that the value add you guys provide has reached the level where pricing is at a point where we don't need to keep providing higher and higher incentives and rebates. This is about the right points. Just a little more color on that would be great? And then just a quick comment on Q4, I know you're saying some of the Europeans stuff is pushed and there\u2019s been a lot of questions on incentives, but it looks like calculating what you're guiding would be about $200 million sequential increasing in your incentive and rebate line, which is kind of lot. I mean it just hard to envision why that would all be in one quarter unless there\u2019s I think someone else has other things going on. So that\u2019s really just the thought of the question. Thanks guys.\nAl Kelly: One the first question Darrin, when you look at the overall numbers, it's a result of hundreds of deals around the world, and they all take on different flavors. I think in general people bet many of our clients and a testament to that is the longevity of many of our relationships that are very deep and have lasted decades that people value plenty of aspects what Visa brings to the table from our global scale to our risk and fraud prevention tools to our brand et cetera. That said, all of that stuff is valued when it comes to negotiation people negotiate a card as do we and you end up, everybody ends up, compromising and end up in a certain place. But I think I haven't seen nor as I\u2019ve talked to our clients around the world, any view that the value that we\u2019re bringing into the table is any less than it's been in fact. I think as we move into a digital world and we continue to try to be a leader in terms of thinking about digital tools and solutions that I think that many issuers particularly when you get beyond the very top issuers who also had the funds and wherewithal to be investing in some of these kinds of capabilities that are -- what we bring to the table is very valued. Vasant, you want to add to that.\nVasant Prabhu: The only thing was that there was a specific question on why client incentive if you derived the fourth quarter might look the way they do. I would say a couple of things. There is the fiscal fourth quarter effect to some degree in that. We have been talking to people especially in Europe for several months now in and it back and forth on finalizing agreements and the documentation and so on and there\u2019s a fair amount of that is happening in the fourth quarter and as we get it done in the fourth quarter since these discussions have been underway for a few months. As happens in many cases the incentives you pay reflect when the deal was either agreed to or initially discuss. So there\u2019s an element of retro-attractiveness to it all of which is captured in the incentives you would probably recognize in the fourth quarter. So some elements of all that that flow into it, and then as Al said, I mean, we have fairly rigorous process and we do the best we can to give you the best sense, but in the end we won't sign a deal because quarterly deadline is approaching, but we\u2019ll do our very best to get done everything we are setting out to do right now.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Darrin. Next question.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is open.\nCraig Maurer: Hi. Jack, it\u2019s been pleasure over the better part of 15 years, hopefully we can meet up in Tahoe one day. Regarding the business can you first comment on what your success rate has been in Asia and China specifically in converting dual brand cards into a single brand companion card for cross-border? And secondly, was there any benefit in service fees from the restructuring of contracts around the breakup of scheme and processing in Europe? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: On service fees in Europe really sort of it\u2019s \u2013 the breakup of scheme and processing. We\u2019ll se over time what the impact is. But in the short run it really has no impact on the fee structure that was in place. But it will evolve over time, I\u2019m sure. In China you know\u2026\nAl Kelly: I think in China we have I think we have 55 banks and 42 of them only issue the single branded card. The remaining 14, 13 do the dual branded. We\u2019ve had some success, frankly not as good as we would like it be and its going to continue to be a real focus of ours and something that given the importance of the cross-border volume from China something that we\u2019re working closely with the banks on. I\u2019m going be in India and China in three weeks and that is something that I will be talking to both our team there as well as our Chinese client.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Just in terms of the trend in that business over the last couple of quarters we highlighted issue last quarter. I want you to know as we said earlier that if you adjust for China, Asia was growing double-digit. The domestic dual branded card volumes in China were relatively stable quarter to quarter, so we didn\u2019t see a sequential decline. And the cross-border business coming out of China as Al said in his comments has been strong and stable. How it all plays out in the next few months, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\nCraig Maurer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you and congratulation Jack, it\u2019s bittersweet. I guess I have another question on incentives and specific to Europe through the commercialization of the contract there, understanding there some -- the timing-related impacts that are causing lower incentives this year. Are there any specific pricing impact as well that happen in conjunction with the commercialization of those contracts? Or should we expect those to sort of happen at the same time? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: We made -- in the year that we've owned Visa Europe. We have made a few pricing changes and there are number pricing changes that we\u2019re continuing to look at it in addition to obviously the commercialization of as you said of the contracts to do away with rebates and put incentives in place.\nSanjay Sakhrani: But do those happen at the same time at points like when you renew them and put in new incentive agreements. Does that come with the revised price schedule?\nAl Kelly: So the price schedule as you know we have our price schedule and then the incentives then are tailored by client. So when we make price adjustments we make them for the system as a whole typically and then the commercial \u2013 the commercialization of some of these contracts is something we do client by client. And just to emphasize, I mean the vast majority of our business in Europe has been and remains under contract. This is something we\u2019re doing ourselves proactively to adjust some of the terms in the contracts to make them more commercial in a world where rebates no longer existed. But the pricing itself is that's related to our normal course what we call rack rates or list prices or whatever you want to call it.\nJack Carsky: Okay. Thanks Sanjay. Next question.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. And Jack, I can only say one thing, jealous but congratulations. Well deserved, I'm sure. A lot was said at the Analyst Day around Visa Direct, and I wanted to just kind of hone in on the partnership you have now with PayPal, this collaboration you guys are doing. I guess one is are those cards -- the debit cards that are going to be issued, are you going to actually route those through Visa Direct? And then secondly, do you think that, that partnership will help insulate you guys from some of the risks associated with PSD2? Thanks.\nJack Carsky: Well, first of all we\u2019re very pleased to extent our deals that we have with PayPal in North America and Asia into Europe. And particularly the fact that we\u2019re operating full consumer choice, and obviously part of the deal is the ability to use Visa Direct to push PayPal account balance to bank accounts. And it's a fairly extensive deal because there\u2019s also an enablement of Visa Checkout relative to the Braintree Gateway. And in Europe in particular given the fact that PayPal has a banking license we\u2019re obviously licensing them as a full-fledged issuer where they'll issue PayPal\u2019s debit cards in Europe. So it's an extensive agreement that absolutely covers Visa Direct, but it also covers the very important aspect of the prior deals centered around full consumer choice as well as then working closely with us in enabling Visa Checkout as well.\nDan Perlin: And do you think that helps in that partnership to protect you guys from PSD2 as that regulation rolls within 2018?\nAl Kelly: I think that everywhere that we can further embed a Visa card into the payment stream and build the loyalty of the consumer certainly helps us. I mean, I think that at the end of the day PSD2 is going to generate a requirement that everybody focuses really hard on consumers and trying to make sure that they're providing the best possible consumer value propositions and the best possible consumer experiences. So to the degree that we could help further solidify the relationship that our issuers have with their customers, all that can only go to help fortify the issuers against the against PSD2 and the competition that can come from their accounts happening to be opened.\nDan Perlin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Wanted to just ask what percentage of the European contracts are done today? I know you said 75% to 80% is the goal for the end of the year, but just looking for a mark for today. And then secondly at the time of the Visa Europe acquisition I think the deal was to be EPS accretive in low single digits for fiscal year 2017 and then high single-digit percentage points range by fiscal year 2020. There\u2019s been a lot of moving pieces here. I'm just looking for an update now on if those goals will stand?\nAl Kelly: Well, the question number one, Bryan, and I\u2019ll let Vasant answer question number two. We don\u2019t want to get into a daily tally sheet on this, but again we\u2019re not probably going to disappoint by not quantifying exactly where we are, but I think you can assume that we\u2019re somewhere below 80, but above a fairly decent number since that we are confident in being able to say we think we can get to 80% by the end of the fourth quarter, but we don't really want to get into setting a precedent of providing that kind of update. Vasant, in term of accretion.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. In terms of accretion as you all know, volumes, European economies have been stronger than we expected, so our volumes as you\u2019ve seen have been running better than we might have expected at the beginning of the year. All when we did the acquisition model that valued Visa Europe. Certainly the weak pound and the euro have helped the cross-border business, frankly the weak pound has caused a massive amount of cross-border into the UK. In addition to that you know that we have taken some pricing and our yields have run a little better than we expected. And so far things are well in terms of renewals and retaining contracts and business and so on. So when you put it all together clearly Visa Europe is doing better than we expected this year and accretion is running ahead of the low single-digits we have told you. But the year isn't over yet, so we\u2019ll till the end of the year and give you an update in October as to whether accretion was in the first year and whether we have a different perspective on the longer term outlook on accretion. But its early days and things are going well.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Bryan.\nBryan Keane: Right. Thanks. Congrats Jack as well.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nVasu Govil: Hi. This is Vasu Govil for James. Thanks for taking my question and Jack, congratulations.\nJack Carsky: Thank you.\nVasu Govil: Just quick question, first one to Vasant, you talked about \u2013 you sort of mentioned that cross-border volumes would kind of lap the double-digit growth rate next quarter. So just want to get a sense for what\u2019s baked into guidance? Are we assuming that this double-digit growth rate is sustainable or do you think that it could decelerate back into the sort of high single-digit range? And then a question for Al on India, Visa is clearly benefiting from the government push towards non-cash form of payment there, but there are local mobile wallet players that seem to be making a big portion there fast getting traction. So can you talk about the competitive dynamic and potential for India -- the Indian market to kind of leapfrog card payments and go straight to mobile? And how is Visa position on the ground do sort of preserve and grew their within electronic payments in India?\nVasant Prabhu: So, on the cross-border growth rate, real quick, we like what we see on the cross-border trend. We\u2019ve seen the pound strengthen a bit, but that didn\u2019t change the strength of the cross-border business into the UK. We saw the dollar weaken a bit, but that didn\u2019t seem to change the trend so far of cross-border business outside going, leaving the U.S. So overall the cross-border business seems to have pretty good momentum. And yes, the comparison get tougher, but we feel pretty optimistic about it. So we\u2019ll wait and see how it goes. When you lap big increases of course you have to \u2013 it\u2019s a little harder to forecast, but we like what we see a lot.\nAl Kelly: In terms of India, its such an exciting market and there's a lot going on obviously because it's an exciting market and a lot going on, there\u2019s a number of players trying to get into the market. We\u2019ve been there for a long time. We believe that as we think about growing our network and in particular merchant acceptance that we have to have different plans in emerging market versus a developed market and in the case of India we clearly have to have a way that's low cost, low hassle, low friction to enable merchants to sign up and that is why we initially went with a QR code and now we have worked closely with some of our network colleagues on an interoperable QR code that works with our mVisa application and allows a quick and easy and will have to setup for merchants and a relatively easy experience for the India consumer. It is very very early in the payments maturation curve for India. There is years of to still play out here and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to take advantage of our heritage and tradition, our brand, our different products that are our security, the globality of our network as well as our digital tools to make sure that we\u2019re winning at least our fair share if not more of the business in India as it grows recognizing clearly that we've got competitors that go beyond the -- just the traditional players that we competed with over the last number of decades.\nVasu Govil: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paulo Ribeiro from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nPaulo Ribeiro: Thank you. Good evening. When you talk about the impact on expenses from tech investing, could you give us some color on where you\u2019re investing? I assume part of it is China and where else in terms of either geography or products have you guys focused your dollars on?\nAl Kelly: I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re talking about technology?\nPaulo Ribeiro: Yes. Your technology, because you guys mentioned that what's driving expense is technology and Visa Europe integration? What is in technology? Where are you spending the money in terms of....\nAl Kelly: Well I\u2019ll start and Vasant can add to what I have to say. Clearly China is one where we\u2019ve stated a number of times that we are investing ahead of the process of you\u2019ve been able to actually operate there not knowing exactly when that will be. I would say the other categories that come immediately to mind are open VisaNet. We talked a bit about that at Investor Day that we are looking as we have begun the process of building a more open architecture world and a more modularized version of VisaNet to meet the needs that we have going forward and allow us the flexibility to actually we have necessary put processing right in a country without it being a big deal where a data center could be in a small closet as opposed to a large facility that has to have all of the accompanying electronics and cooling and etcetera fairly digital. And all of the digital tools that we are building is an area that we are spending a lot of time and effort on research. We opened up a -- I think we talked about this at some point in the past that in February we opened up a new facility in [Indiscernible] focussed on research and we are doing a whole number of things around looking at applications of block chain and all official intelligence and different other ways to build a data and our analytics capabilities. And I guess the fifth category I would say would be security and cyber security given how important security and trust in the payments ecosystem is we continue to look at every possible offering that\u2019s out there related to physical and cyber security and make sure that we are being leading edge and investing appropriately to make sure that given the role that we play in the ecosystem that we are doing everything we possibly can help make sure that transactions as they are flowing through the system and transactions as when they are at rest are all protected to the maximum degree possible. So those will be the things I would say. Would you add anything Vasant?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I think the other things Al went through I think a very comprehensive list. I mean a few other things just to highlight would be continued investment in the Visa developer platform. Investments and now rolling our Visa checkout and Visa Token Service and mVisa around the world. Big push on mVisa in places like India and parts of Africa. Investments in our innovation centers, you heard about the London Innovation center and how significant it has become. Investments in co-development around our innovation centers with our clients. So that\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of areas where the things we have developed are now in the process of being deployed.\nPaulo Ribeiro: Great. Just a quick clarification. PayPal, the roll out of the PayPal partnerships around the world they are not a big investment, they are not in that number then that we are spending.\nAl Kelly: There is a little bit of work there, but the essences of those agreements are not a major workload for us, it\u2019s more a matter of, actually more change actually on the part of PayPal and it is on part of us. And I\u2019d say \u2013 I\u2019d add that they have been a really terrific partner.\nPaulo Ribeiro: Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Jenny, at this point we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis, Bernstein. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hey guys and Jack you will be next one final congrats from me. Visa Checkout related question from me, one, do you have any updated stats to give us on Visa checkout and then little bit of a more strategic question, you know you continue to kind of fight head to head with Visa Checkout with these more staged wallets around the world whether that\u2019s with PayPal or with [Indiscernible] payor now some of the models inside of Amazon, would you contemplate adding more of that capability within Visa Checkout meaning via prepaid vehicle the ability to keep a store balance Visa Direct, using Visa Direct to be able to enable P2P and why enrol or why not?\nAl Kelly: Hi Lisa. And answer to your first question, we are nearing 23 million users who have signed, you know actually signed up for Visa Checkout. I think we talked a little bit about this. The whole wallet [ph] thing is a bit of a mixed bag of activity around the industry and I think not necessarily the most user friendly thing for consumers because there are so many options. We think of these Checkout more as a platform that we necessarily think about it as wallet and but that said strategically I think anything that supports the four party model that makes sense in terms of integration or capability we\u2019re going to be open to look at as we go forward, because ultimately we want to be part of a solution of coming up with a smaller number of easy, convenient and wallet that have the type of functionality that consumers would want and expect and hope that help brings some of what I think is a bit of confusion around wallets and Checkout in the e-commerce world, bring a bit more order to it overtime.\nLisa Ellis: Perfect. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Lisa.\nJack Carsky: And thank you all for joining us today.

We\u2019re halfway through our fiscal year for 2017 and we\u2019re quite pleased with the strong business results that continued into the second quarter. Similar to Q1, our business momentum was broad based with solid payment volume growth, a double-digit increase in cross-border revenue and healthy operating metrics from all of the regions. Despite geo-political uncertainty, our business continues to deliver sustained growth as we displace cash and capitalize on the opportunities in front of us. We\u2019re performing well against our operating plan and our strategic priorities for the year. I\u2019m excited to see a high level of business execution continuing into this fiscal second quarter where we saw robust growth in payments, volume, cross-border business and processed transactions. This growth combined with client incentive delays led to better than expected financial performance. We grew net revenue by 23% and adjusted EPS by 27% versus prior year\u2019s results. We also reorganized some of our legal entities including Visa Europe and created the Visa Foundation with an initial charitable contribution. This provides us an opportunity as a company to expand our charitable giving and our philanthropic activity. Vasant will go into this in a greater detail to highlight some of the normalized comparisons and also discuss the impact of the reorganization and the charitable contribution. We continue to work closely with our valued clients around the world. Well I do not plan to talk about renewals on every call. This was a particularly active quarter, so I do want to highlight some notable agreements. In North America, we renewed a multi-year credit, debit, commercial and prepaid partnership with PNC Financial Services Group. We also renewed a multi-year debit agreement with Citizens Bank and multi-year credit and debit agreements with First National Bank of Omaha. And on the co-brand side, we renewed an important credit card relationship of Hyatt Hotels and Resorts. In Asia Pacific, we signed a ten year exclusive partnership with ANZ Bank. In both Australia and New Zealand, we also signed a commercial credit partnership with Citibank covering multiple markets in Asia Pacific. In Taiwan, we signed a multi-year credit and debit agreement with CTBC Bank Taiwan. In our Latin America region, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, the largest bank in credit card issuer in Puerto Rico renewed a multi-year credit and debit partnership. In Europe, we signed a PAN-Nordic debit renewal with Nordea Bank and a commercial and consumer card renewal with BNP Paribas Group in France. In addition to our renewals, we signed a number of key partnerships. We announced the IBM Watson partnership to help support payments in the Internet of Things and encourage the usage of tokenization. As a leading network, it is part of our role to look forward and anticipate. To that end and where applicable we want to ensure an on ramp for payments integration in the Internet of Things. This collaboration brings the point of sale everywhere Visa is accepted by allowing businesses to quickly introduce secure experiences for any connected device. We also executed the PayPal partnership in Asia Pacific, which is similar to our partnership in the United States. This partnership helps ensure transaction data sharing and provides consumer choice for an improved consumer experience. More recently, we announced the launch of an enhanced transaction data capability for Amazon business customers in the United States. This enables participating issuers to provide their U.S. commercial account holders a comprehensive view of their Amazon business purchases including full line item details on purchases made with their Visa commercial card that integrate with popular reconciliation tools. Our digital expansion effort showed great progress in Q2. Visa Checkout is sustaining tremendous growth, reaching more than 20 million enrolled accounts. Additional brand merchants are adopting Visa Checkout to improve their online shopping experience. And the growing list of over 300,000 merchants now includes Alaska Airlines, Avis, Marriott and Walmart amongst others. And our push payments products at Visa Direct and mVisa are continuing to expand globally in various markets. This past quarter, I continue to spend a lot of time with clients, partners and government officials. Combined with my travel in my first few weeks, I\u2019ve had an opportunity now to visit most of our top markets and I plan to get to additional markets in the coming weeks and months. During almost all the visits I\u2019ve balanced my time between meetings with investors, employees, clients both issuer and merchant clients and government officials. I thought it might be helpful to share a few overall and a few specific impressions from these meetings. In terms of overall impressions, the Visa brand and our reputation with our clients is very good. Clients appreciate the association with our people and our incredible brand. Regulation is present almost everywhere although it clearly differs from market to market. I validated what I already knew that the payment space is a local business driven by history, traditions and local regulations. The state of innovation, issuer relationships and acceptance penetration are specific to each individual country, so you must be local to win in the payment space. And my final observation is that opportunity abounds around the world. More specifically, let me highlight some of our ongoing efforts in a number of countries. In Russia, we have a very good presence and enjoy terrific relationships with an impressive set of bank partners both state owned as well as private. As a developed economy, Russia is growing domestically and in outbound travel, which contributes significantly to our cross-border business growth. Where Russia has a domestic processor and a domestic scheme in New Year, the government understands the value of other networks and we are working well with the government\u2019s central bank as well as our issuer partners. Russia is also building excitement for the upcoming Confederations Cup this year and the FIFA World Cup in 2018, which represent opportunities for growth in this market. China as I said before is a long-term opportunity. It\u2019s an important market and we will be patient. I recently enjoyed meeting a number of key influential people during my trip to Beijing. They were very helpful. That said it will take time to apply for and pass the various review steps before we obtain a domestic license. We are working on a path forward, which I discussed with key people and we received helpful feedback. Beyond the pursuit of a domestic license, the phasing out of the dual branded cards has begun to impact us in terms of payment volume and revenue and we expect to feel this impact a bit more as we look ahead. Turning to Japan, I\u2019m very excited about the opportunities. Japan today is a huge cash society with a large number of credit cards, but a small number of debit cards. I had a chance to meet with over thirty clients and the enthusiasm was very high. I really believe that Japan will take off over the next few years driven by a positive and an active government in terms of driving payments to be more electronic or digital, growth in contact list and the emergence of e-commerce. The Olympics in 2020 will be a great showcase for digital progress as the games are largely going to be in and around the city of Tokyo. In India, we\u2019re working with partners and government agencies to expand our presence. Post demonetization in November, domestic process transaction continues to grow significantly and was up well over 100% this past quarter. Today cash availability has largely returned to normal levels. Our transactions primarily come from domestic debit in low-ticket non-discretionary categories as we\u2019re driving debit awareness. We\u2019re also scaling up physical and digital acceptance through bank partnerships and new product introduction. Points of acceptance have increased 50% in the five months since demonetization and is now above two million. Looking at the European business, we\u2019re gratified with the overall performance. Our acquisition of Visa Europe has provided our business with a truly global presence as we operate as one Visa worldwide. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us we\u2019re pleased with the business integration progress to date. We are in active discussions with our clients as we migrate to new commercial frameworks with incentive structures. The vast majority of payments volume continues to be under contract. We\u2019re also in the process of building a strong and stable European leadership team. Following the recent resignation of Visa Europe, CEO Nicolas Huss, Bill Sheedy has taken on the interim CEO role as of April 1st. Bill is a 25 year veteran of Visa and is well known to the European team given his role in the acquisition and early integration. Bill provides invaluable leadership in business continuity as we integrate the European operations and while the form of search process is underway. We continue to work with our clients and partners to deliver on our innovation agenda in Europe and create new products, services and business opportunities. This past quarter, we met a number of successful contactless transit launches in the U.K. and Italy and Visa Token Service continues to expand with recent Android Pay launches in Poland and Ireland. In February, we launched the Visa Innovation Center in London and so our strong client engagement with over 50 client sessions held onsite to date and a significant pipeline of demand ahead of us. We maintained our strong record of accomplishment of delivering value to our shareholders through a disciplined capital allocation plan. We continue to make investments in our core business. We invested in our merchant service offerings by completing the cargo commerce transaction in February. The 3-D Secure 2.0 standard and detection provides greater fraud protection and will increase approval authorizations in a channel that has historically had high or a higher level of denials. In fiscal Q2, we delivered on our commitment to driving shareholder value as we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders consisting of 1.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly 400 million through dividends. We continue to accelerate our share buyback activity to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction. Lastly at Tuesday\u2019s board meeting, we received approval to increase our share buyback authorization by $5 billion resulting in a total purchase authorization of $7.2 billion. As we move to the second half of our fiscal year, we feel good about the momentum in the business and look forward to the future ahead. I\u2019ve enjoyed the opportunity to meet with many of our shareholders over the past months and I hope to meet more of you in the coming months. As a reminder our Investor Day will be held on June 22nd in San Francisco, so I hope you will be able to join us. And with that let me turn it over to Vasant to cover some of the financial details.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. The strong growth trends we started the year will continued through the second quarter. Second quarter net revenue and EPS once again exceeded our expectations. On a GAAP basis, fiscal second quarter net revenues were up 23%, EPS including special items related to the reorganization of Visa Europe was $0.18. Excluding these special items, adjusted net income for the quarter was $2.1 billion and EPS $0.86. Adjusting last year\u2019s results for a gain related to currency forward contract EPS was up 27%. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted net revenue growth by approximately 2.5 percentage points and EPS growth by approximately 4 percentage points. A few key points. Adjusted for the extra day in February last year, global growth rates in payment volumes, process transactions and cross-border volumes remained robust and generally in line with first quarter trends. Once again timing of client incentives added almost $0.03 to our second quarter results as some deal renewals were pushed out into the second half. We completed our legal entity reorganization of Visa Europe and other of Visa subsidiaries to align our global corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which we have business operations. This reduced our reporter tax rate to 28.6% after adjusting for two nonrecurring special items. Finally, we bought back 19.1 million shares of Class A common stock in the second quarter at an average price of $88.51 for $1.7 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2017, we bought back 41.4 million shares for $3.5 billion at an average price of $83.81. Our board has authorized a new 5 billion share repurchase program increasing funds available for stock buybacks to $7.2 billion. Before I discuss our second quarter results and outlook for the year some more details on the Visa Europe reorganization and its impact. We are pleased to have completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and other subsidiaries. This has several implications. First, our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was lower at 28.6%. As a result, our full year adjusted tax rate will now be approximately 50 basis points lower than prior expectations. Next year with a full year benefit from the new structure, we will have a further reduction of approximately 100 basis points in our tax rate. Second, following this reorganization, we returned a net $1.3 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. This transaction did not constitute a return of undistributed earnings and as such was not subject to U.S. taxes. This return of cash precludes the need for us to issue any debt until later this calendar year when the first traunch from our December 2015 debt issuance matures. We have the ability to return more cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and we\u2019ll update you as and when we do it. Third associated with this reorganization the newly formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc shares, which are previously held by Visa Europe and recorded as treasury stock. The reorganization provided us an opportunity to achieve this goal in a tax efficient manner. The charitable donation, which totaled $192 million, was recorded in general and administrative expenses. There was an associated $17 million reduction in income tax provisions reflecting the tax benefit of the contribution. Both these items are nonrecurring and as such were treated as special items. Fourth, as a result of this reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recorded when we acquired Visa Europe in June 2016. As required by U.S. GAAP, we recorded these balances as part of purchase accounting for the acquisition to accrue for potential tax liabilities or assets if we ever sold Visa Europe. The applicable taxes are dependent on the geographic jurisdictions applicable to Visa Europe. In the reorganization, we changed our corporate structure. It is therefore necessary to adjust associated deferred tax balances accordingly. This one-time adjustment has no cash consequences as no tax was actually triggered by the reorganization. As such this approximately $1.5 billion deferred tax adjustment was also treated as a special item. Our press release provides you with a schedule that adjusts GAAP net income and EPS for these special items. Moving now to a review of our key business drivers in the first quarter. U.S. payments volumes grew 12% with credit growing 21% and debit 3%. Adjusting for the extra day in February 2016 would add over 1 percentage point through these growth rates. Even after you adjust for Costco and USAA, credit growth has remained strong especially spending on travel. Excluding Interlink, debit grew 7% in line with the prior quarter when normalized for the leap day. Reported Interlink growth rates continue to be impacted by the lapping of a significant win in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as well as PIN debit routing choices by acquirers and merchants. Gas prices added approximately half a point to payment volume growth in the U.S. As reported international payment volumes grew 68% in constant dollars. In addition to the leap day effect from 2016, international payment volumes are also impacted by the shift in Easter from fiscal Q2 last year to Q3 this year. On a comparable and normalized basis, robust payment volume growth continued across the globe. Growth picked up in Latin America and remains strong in the CEMEA region. Asia sustained double-digit payment volume growth rates excluding China. Payment volume growth in China slowed as a result of a decline in dual branded card volumes as well as loan restrictions lowering real estate transaction volumes. In Europe, excluding co-badge volume in all period growth was steady at 9% despite the leap year and Easter shift impacts. On a reported basis, cross-border volumes grew 132% on a constant-dollar basis, driven by the inclusion of Europe. Adding Europe to prior year results, constant dollar cross-border growth globally was up 11%. In the last week of March, we experienced settlement delays in Europe due to a technical issue. This caused some volume, mostly international volume, which would normally have settled in March to be settled in the first week of April. This reduced second quarter European and normalized global cross-border growth rate by 1 percentage point respectively, impacts on cross-border revenues was de minimums. Strong cross-border growth trends adjusted for the leap year have sustained through the second quarter, held by the relative stability of the dollar and the euro. Once again, the strong dollar drove robust outbound commerce from the U.S. into Canada, Mexico and the U.K. Our U.S acquired business improved, helped by an acceleration of commerce in from Canada and Brazil. As a result, U.S. cross-border volume growth remained in the double-digits and was a percentage point higher than the first quarter rate. Across other geographies, the UK continues to benefit from the weak pound, which is driving significance on inbound commerce. Outbound commerce from Russia accelerated especially into Europe. Outbound commerce from the Middle East continues to weaken, while commerce from sub-Saharan Africa is picking up steam. Cross-border commerce across Latin America was strong. Adjusted for the settlement delay, cross-border growth was steady across Europe. As reported, processed transactions grew 42% due to the inclusion of Europe. On a comparable basis, which includes Europe in prior year\u2019s results, global processed transactions grew 12%. Adjusting for the leap year impact, processed transactions growth rates were stable. U.S. growth rates were modestly lower, primarily due to Interlink, international growth rate stepped up due to India and some new business in Europe. Even as cash available in India has returned to normal, transaction growth rates in excess of 100% have sustained through the second quarter. Through April 14, U.S. payment volumes are up almost 15%. Normalized for Visa Europe, constant dollar cross-border volumes grew 13% and process transaction growth was almost 17%. A word of caution: 2 weeks do not make a trend in the first half \u2013 then first half of April is impacted by the shift in Easter. A quick review of our fiscal second quarter financial results. Service revenue grew 17% in line with first quarter growth rates. Service revenue growth was helped by previously announced price increases offset by a negative currency translation impact. Data processing revenues grew 25%, international revenues grew 41% impacted by lower revenues from currency volatility. Currency volatility declined through the quarter and is currently below the long-term mean. Once again client incentives came in well below our expectations. As I mentioned earlier, lower than expected incentives added $0.03 to our second quarter EPS. Many significant renewals were completed in the quarter as Al described which will drive incentives higher going forward. Several important renewals have shifted to the second half. In Europe, we continue to work with clients to reset our terms post-renewal of rebates. We are comfortable with the progress, but given the large volume of contracts that have to be modified. This will extend into the second half. In the U.S., a couple of renewals, we\u2019ve previously estimated might be done by now will likely be second half events, mostly driven by client timetables. Expenses grew 24% after adjusting for the Visa Foundation contribution, which is recorded in G&A. As expected, expense growth ramped up from the first quarter level and will continue to ramp as we step up marketing and technology spend as well as Europe integration costs. Personnel expenses are impacted by above-normal employee incentive accruals tied to better than expected year-to-date performance and several employees benefit costs that are seasonally higher in the second quarter. Our tax rate adjusted for special items was 28.6% as a result of the completion of the Visa Europe reorganization, driving EPS of $0.86, up 27% on an adjusted basis. Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal year 2017, as you have seen, the key drivers of our results payment volumes, process transactions and cross-border volumes continued to grow at healthy rates all through the first half. The main headwinds this year have been the strong dollar and the weak euro. Fortunately, the dollar and the euro were relatively stable last quarter, and this headwind has not become stiffer. A couple of trends are worse than we had expected last quarter and bear watching. Currency volatility is tracking below the long-term mean and well below last year\u2019s levels. Volumes on Chinese dual-branded cards are declining as cards expire and are not reissued. On the second half, we are assuming payment volume and cross-border growth momentum will be sustained. Client incentives spend is expected to ramp up with the renewals we just completed and deals that are shifting into the second half. Expenses will also step up above second quarter levels as we spend more on marketing and technology initiatives and as well as Europe integration. Based on first half results and current trends, we\u2019re updating several components of our full year fiscal 2017 outlook. We now expect nominal net revenue growth to come in at the high end of our outlook range of 16% to 18%, with client incentives as a percent of gross revenue at the low-end of the 20.5%, 21.5% range. There is no change in margin expectations in the mid 60s. As a result of our Visa Europe reorganization, our tax rate after adjusting for special items is expected to be 50 bps or basis points better at approximately 30%. Nominal adjusted EPS growth also adjusted for special items is now projected to be at the high-end of the mid-teens range. With that I will turn this back to Jack.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Vasant. Christine, it\u2019s time. We are ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Line is now open.\nBob Napoli: Now, thank you and good afternoon. So this is the second quarter in a row where the company has materially exceeded expectations. What this \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s a lot going on. What are the main surprises to Visa on the outperformance? Is it Visa Europe is a lot more accretive than what you thought? Is it a somewhat better economy, more market share? What is driving the upside surprises?\nAl Kelly: Bob, it\u2019s Al. I would say number one, it\u2019s fairly healthy economies around the world where [indiscernible] in every quarter get fortunate where \u2013 when you look across the globe, you see fairly robust growth and that\u2019s what we had seen. I think I had said in the first quarter that we saw that with the exception of Brazil. Brazil was not terrific, but that are in the second quarter. I think the second thing is the fact that we saw more of the client incentives that we expected to happen in the second quarter are going to move to later in the year. So those will be the two things I\u2019d point out. And then of course, cross-border growth has continued to stay very robust. As you saw, we\u2019ve had now three quarters in a row where cross-border has been in the double-digit range especially strong has been U.S. cross-border, both issued and the acquired holding up pretty well. And that, as you know, is a good business for us. So again it\u2019s strength of global economies.\nBob Napoli: Great, thank you. I appreciate it.\nJack Carsky: Thanks, Bob. Next question, Christine.\nOperator: Next question is from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Line is now open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Thanks for my question. The lower 2017 incentives guidance, as you mentioned, is pushing forward some renewals that you thought were going to happen earlier in the year. Is there an implication that you\u2019re pushing out into 2018 things that would have occurred in 2017, because you\u2019re taking down the total 2017 number. And then I guess do you have any greater clarity on the potential effects of FASB rule changes on revenue recognition coming into effect next year, how that might impact this revenue \u2013 this incentive line?\nJack Carsky: Well, on the first point, we do our best to try to estimate these client incentives. We\u2019re in essence having to estimate 3 different things. One is the timing of when deals are going to happen; number two, what are going to be the terms of those deals once they\u2019re finally negotiated; and then number three, what are \u2013 once those deals are taking place, what \u2013 the actual volume performance is going to be. So it\u2019s relatively tricky stuff. That said, I think not only did we see some of the renewals we expected to happen in Q2 dip into Q \u2013 into the second half of the year. The other point is the one that Vasant made in his prepared remarks about the rebates being replaced by incentives in Europe. It\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of accounts, and it\u2019s simply taking us longer to get through all of the various work getting through the clients getting negotiated, getting through lawyers on both sides just playing it simple, taking longer than we thought. I\u2019ll let Vasant deal with this FASB question.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah, on the FASB side, yes, there are new revenue recognition standards. I think you\u2019ve heard us say that there\u2019s no real economic impact from it. We are working to clarify how those standards are applying to us. We are working through what that impact on us might be. There are two possible places in which there could be changes in the reporting. One is what is classified under client incentives versus what is classified under expenses, and then how certain kinds of payments are amortized on client incentive contracts. Once again, as we go through that and we get clarity from the SEC and the FASB on a couple of open items, they will be able to do all the work and give you some sense of it. But at this stage, that\u2019s where things stand.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. All right, thanks a lot.\nJack Carsky: Next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question is from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Line is now open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon guys. Can you comment a bit on your view on the impact of PSD2 regulations in Europe and more broadly the regulatory environment in Europe?\nJack Carsky: Well, Lisa, I think you know it\u2019s a little early to tell how exactly the PSD2 is going to play out. We\u2019re obviously engaged in talking to the regulators, talking to our clients and obviously having our own internal discussions about how things could play out. We\u2019ve been working with the regulators to make sure that the authentication process is done in a \u2013 with some pragmatic elements on it in terms of where you need \u2013 where you can use normal kind of risk authorization tools and techniques versus having two different forms of authentication, but where exactly it plays out is too early \u2013 I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell. As relates to balance the regulation in Europe, we\u2019re continuing to make sure that we\u2019re complying properly with the breakup of scheme and processor. It\u2019s being perfectly blunt about it. It\u2019s a bit of a cultural challenge and that we\u2019re being forced to separate people and organizations that were accustomed for years to working together. But we\u2019re obviously doing everything that we need to do to make sure we comply. And then broader regulation around the world, we\u2019re tracking very carefully. Probably the most relevant recent news came out of Argentina, where they have regulated interchange effective now at a 200 bps for credit, 100 bps for debit, but it will slide down over the next five years and land at 130 credit and 60 on debit.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific, thanks. And if you don\u2019t mind me asking just the same question, but for India, can you give a little more color on exactly what\u2019s going on the ground? In India decisions being made with the government with the central bank et cetera around how the payment system is going to evolve there?\nJack Carsky: Well, we would have expected sometime over the last couple of weeks to have gotten clarity. There was supposed to be clarity no later than the end of March on kind of the next chapter of regulation or guidance in terms of how things would have to go forward. And there hasn\u2019t been, and we\u2019ve been told that it will be delayed likely into early May. So we\u2019re right now continuing to make sure that we put as much emphasis as we can on growing the number of acceptance points throughout India, both kind of a traditional POS as well as using mVisa side and QR codes. And we made tremendous progress with merchant acceptance point up 50% in the country from November 8th until the end of the quarter. And it\u2019s still obviously very small compared to what it could be and will be relative to the population of India, but it certainly is a very healthy start from where we were in November. So we\u2019ll know more in May, but we\u2019re operating now under the pricing that\u2019s exists out there, which is 75 basis points, 40 basis points and 30 basis points depending upon the size of the transaction.\nOperator: Thank you.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from David Togut from Evercore. Line is now open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good afternoon. How do your revenue growth expectations for Visa Europe compared now versus the time you acquired the business at the end of June? And in particular are there any countries you are more or less optimistic about from a growth standpoint?\nAl Kelly: Well I mean as we told you before we are very happy with how Visa Europe has come along post the closing of the acquisition in June. In general it is tracking at or above our expectations whether it\u2019s revenue or accretion. Cross-border business certainly has been strong in Europe, payment volumes have been somewhat higher than where they were around the time when we closed on the acquisition. Our yields have been heading in the right direction most of the expense actions relating to consultation process are completed they are now working on the technology integration. So on all fronts Visa Europe is performing pretty much at or above our expectations.\nVasant Prabhu: On the second party of your question, where there is pockets of good potential? Our largest markets are the UK and France, and I think we look at Germany, Italy, the Nordic countries and Spain where we have a pretty good business already as well. A deadly place where I would highlight is where we think there\u2019s specific potential. But I think we feel very good about the potential in many markets across the continent.\nOperator: Thanks you.\nAl Kelly: Next question.\nOperator: And next question is from Andrew Jeffrey form SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, thank you for taking the question. Actually a follow-up on David\u2019s question, with regard to Europe Al could you elaborate a little bit on the timing of some of the yield and expense initiatives in Europe. .It sounds like we\u2019re going to start to see maybe even a little more of an impact in the second half of 2017 and extensively into 2018. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can get order of magnitude maybe?\nAl Kelly: Well I think on the expense side we\u2019re about two thirds of the way through what we want to do. On the revenue side we\u2019re probably a little bit behind where we had hoped to be a taking a bit longer than we had hoped to kind of work our way through the deals that have to be reconstituted. We got some very good momentum going now, so I\u2019m certainly hoping that the pace is going to pick up here in the third quarter and into the into the fourth quarter. But obviously if we bring on a good amount of those deals in Q3 and Q4 it\u2019s going to create a good run rate for us going into fiscal 2018.\nVasant Prabhu: On the expense side, I mean the next set of actions is all around the technology integration. So the first thing that has to happen is technology platforms have to be harmonized. And then we can act on what we do with the technology infrastructure. And that would be, as we told you couple of years out. And on the on the client incentive side, as we get these new deals done, certainly that is one of the reasons why the expected higher rate of client incentives in the second half as this pipeline of rebates and client incentives adjustments make their way through and get done.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open. \nDarrin Peller: Thanks guys. Research Division with personal growth still a little higher than we thought, you still had strong margins, I think turning it about 68% for the first half. So just first what would drive the margin to the low end of 60% range I guess average out in the mid 60s for the year? And then Al can you just tell us how you conceptually think about the company\u2019s margin plans I guess I don\u2019t guide in just for mid-60s, but just again as a CEO now, should we assume your strategy is to let operating leverage pass through up above 70% over the years to come or is there a different approach?\nAl Kelly: Well I think that \u2013 I\u2019ll answer the second half of your question first and I\u2019ll let Vasant talk about the first part of your question. Well we\u2019re going to \u2013 my view is that to the degree that we have good opportunities to invest in future growth whether that\u2019s organic or acquisitions, we\u2019re going to do that. And that\u2019s going to be the first use of capital always for us. And from my vantage point if that means that for a period we\u2019re investing a little bit of our margin to promote growth because we think we\u2019ve got an abundance of good ideas. We\u2019re going to go ahead and do that.  That said it is a high leverage business in the next 1,000, 10,000 transactions we don\u2019t really add much cost until we reach a point we got to hang another server up in our data center and we got a cost associated with that. We have very strong operating leverage in the business. And so to the degree that revenue continue to grow, the reality is that and the revenue has grown higher than our expenses because of our leverage the margin would naturally run up. But that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re just going to sit by idly and have that happen. What ends up happening is going to be a result of decisions we make relative to the investment opportunities that are presented in front of us around the world.\nVasant Prabhu: In terms of a question on near term margins, your first question, just a few things I just want to point out that I had in the prepared remarks. One is that you saw that our expense is ramping. And that ramp is partially in personnel expenses, but also as we get to the second half there is going to be a further ramp in our marketing and our technology based on some programs that\u2019s second half based. In addition to that the Visa Europe integration costs are also ramping. So there\u2019s a set of costs that are ramping in the second half. And then the second item is client incentives have been lower than the expected. We still believe that they will be in the range we gave you earlier although it\u2019s more likely at the lower end of the range which is higher than where they have been in the first half. So when you put that all together, it gives you a sense of where margins are likely to be in the second half.\nDarrin Peller: Thank you.\nJack Carsky: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks I just had a follow-up on some of the emerging market discussions. Al, you mentioned your China visits and how the road might be a little bit more complicated to get the licensing. Could you just talk a little bit more about the timeline you\u2019re expecting and whether or not there\u2019s other opportunities in that market to work with some of the players that are proliferating? And maybe just on India just to what monetization opportunity is? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Well, on China I\u2019m not going to talk about what we think might be the best path forward. It just became very clear to me as I talk to government officials, that even if at this moment, we had our ducks completely in a row and knew exactly how we wanted to proceed in terms of filing for domestic license it just is a very complicated review process. And in fact not all of the necessary steps are actually memorialized. One of the things that I found out is that hopefully the Chinese government by the end of the second quarter is going to publish a set of more clarifying rules about international entities and what would be required to submit for a license. So this is Sanjay, I think it has been communicated in the past. This is a long term play. But I think we have to be patient because this is in a country of 13 million or 130 million people, it\u2019s almost 1.4 billion people and it\u2019s just simply going to take time. I think in the short to medium term, the reality is that the insistence, what\u2019s an increasingly insistence on the part of the government for issuers to move away from the dual co-badge cards is in fact going to impact us in a negative way. It will impact us more meaningfully purchase volume, but we\u2019re going to see some impact on revenue. That said, we still expect that many of our partners are continuing to \u2013 as we know as come up instead of obviously renewing with dual-badge cards, they\u2019re renewing card a CUP card and a Visa card to facilitate international travel. So we still believe that cross-border traffic from Chinese citizens traveling outside of China will continue to be quite good. Turning to India, again, I think this is a longer-term play, but it\u2019s a longer-term play that\u2019s right now got real wind at its back. And we\u2019re investing and we\u2019ve made it clear to our folks on the ground in India that we\u2019re behind them and we\u2019ll invest what\u2019s necessary to take advantage of the wind at our backs right now. In terms of how big this is, I think there\u2019s a number of things that we have to watch. we\u2019ll have to see where the actual pricing actually nets out when we get the final words from the regulators, so that it\u2019s \u2013 make sure it\u2019s attractive enough. We\u2019ll have to see how the government in India continues or doesn\u2019t continue to have this sustained push behind the efforts here. But right now and until circumstances dictate that we should do otherwise we\u2019re full steam ahead in trying to drive coverage, build awareness relative to mVisa and our app and trying to drive as many through marketing, drive as many Indian citizens into this world of using their mobile phone to transact for the purchases at least for their everyday goods and items.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Mihalos: Great thanks for taking my question guys. Just wanted to build off of the last question as it pertains to China, and Al and Vasant, your comments around monitoring some of the China co-badge cards. Can you size for us what the potential impact could be maybe in terms of volume, for example, something that could be at risk? And then second question, Vasant, I just want to make sure on the tax rate, I\u2019m thinking about it correctly. For 2017, you\u2019re talking about a 30% tax rate going to is it 29% in 2018? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: I\u2019ll take the tax rate. I\u2019m sure Al will add something on the cross-border side in China. On the tax rate I did say that we get a part year benefit from the reorganization we did in Europe, which is about 50 basis points this year. And we will get an additional 100 basis points on top of that next year with a full-year benefit of what we did. As it relates to the dual-branded cards in China, we have incorporated that in our sort of thinking as we look ahead into the second half of the year. It is just something to be monitored. It is not that easy to predict. But we are seeing that the payment volume on these cards is declining as they come up for renewal and they\u2019re being renewed with, as Al said, the single currency card, which do then pick up some of the cross-border volume. I don\u2019t know Al, if you want to add.\nAl Kelly: The only thing I wanted to add is it is difficult to tell. I mean the banks have been somewhat resistant to make this change, which has been a good thing for us. It\u2019s just that there is a bit of a push on them more recently. And I heard that from a number of Chinese bank executives when I was over there. But how quickly it moves is hard to tell. It\u2019s also just hard to tell what we\u2019ll happen with single Visa card issuance in essence a companion card to China Union Pay Card. And what does any impact that has on the cross-border volume which is, in many ways for us right now, the more important volume.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi thanks. Just a clarification a question, just the client incentives. Is the guidance revision all timing-related? Are terms perhaps better than expected? And then my other question was just on the reported U.S. debit volume. I think it shows 3%. Some of that you said steady 7%, adjusting for Interlink. Just curious what\u2019s the outlook here? I know it\u2019s really complicated. Just trying to better understand what we could expect or see on the volume front and perhaps on revenue too with U.S. debit? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: I\u2019ll take U.S. debit real quick. The adjustment as you know, the leap year has an impact on it. And so that\u2019s one factor. Interlink, we have that lapping effect from something we \u2013 a significant win we had in the fourth quarter of 2015, that continues for I guess another couple of quarters. In addition to that, we had a few a certain amount of volume going away from us. So that was an additional factor. And then there was a small impact from some effects in February around delayed tax refunds going to people. So debit was in general a little softer this quarter than credit was. There\u2019s an ongoing shift in from credit to debit in the U.S. market. That\u2019s been going on for a while. So that\u2019s a range of factors, other than that, things have been pretty stable in the debit market.\nAl Kelly: And as it relates to incentives, I would say that it\u2019s primarily timing, because most of the impact is on deals that are not done yet. So the terms are still not fully set, and obviously the volumes haven\u2019t started to take hold. it truly is kind of the $0.03 impact of timing that Vasant referenced in his remarks. \nOperator: Thank you. Next is from Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nCraig Maurer: Yes hi thanks. I\u2019m sorry to go back to it, but I just want a clarification on the China co-badged card piece. As I understand, the co-badged card when it was used domestically, was picked up by CUP and when used in cross-border or was picked up by Visa. So in terms of the volume loss, are you saying that UnionPay is capturing some share from you in cross-border volume. Once the cards are reissued separately and that\u2019s why you are seeing slowdown in purchase volume. And the second question is now that we\u2019re about 6 months in, have you seen material success in your initiatives with PayPal to move ACA to over to Visa cards. Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: So dual-branded card can be used within China, and it can be used outside China. It\u2019s CUP that processes the transaction in China. It\u2019s Visa that processes transactions outside China. When you we use the dual-branded card, if the cross-border \u2013 if the new CUP card that\u2019s issued is used outside China, then we would lose the transaction. But we\u2019ve working very hard with our issuers to have them issue the so-called single currency card, which as Al described as companion card, which we would like Chinese travelers to use when they leave China. And when they do that, we pick up that cross-border transaction too, but it\u2019s hard to know how much of that will stay with us. As it relates to the domestic volumes, there\u2019s a small amount of revenue we make on domestic volume. When we lose that domestic volume when the cards no longer are dual branded and usable in China, we lose a small amount of revenue.\nCraig Maurer: And on PayPal.\nAl Kelly: I\u2019m sorry what was the question on PayPal?\nCraig Maurer: If you\u2019ve seen material success in the six months since signing the deal and moving volume from ACH onto Visa cards.\nAl Kelly: Definitely, they lived up to the spirit of what we want, and it\u2019s a process that we\u2019re going through. But we feel good about the early days, and it\u2019s a ramp over time, and we\u2019ll see. But we feel good that we\u2019re ramping in the right direction.\nCraig Maurer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan Keane: Yes hi guys. Just a couple of clarifications. Just on the personnel costs, they are up a lot. I think it was 33%. That was up after \u2013 up more than the 14% in the first quarter. But I just want to make sure I understand exactly what that was. It sounds like maybe it was employee bonus accruals due to good performance. That\u2019s still a significantly higher number. So I\u2019m trying to figure out that number, what it was? And does that continue at that rate going forward? And just on the clarification on the second point on client incentives, does the pushout impact fiscal 2018? Or is it the pushout that impacts second half 2017? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: So I\u2019ll take the personnel costs and the other one too. On the personal costs, yes, client \u2013 I mean, incentive accruals were higher based on performance. And that there\u2019s a certain amount of catchup you have to do when you make adjustments for the entire first half. So that\u2019s a big component of it. There\u2019s always some pluses and minuses there. Certain FICA related costs start hitting you in the first calendar quarter of every year. Of course, our first \u2013 our second fiscal quarter is the first calendar quarter. So there\u2019s an element of seasonality as well as increase in some of those costs. So it\u2019s one big item which is incentive accruals and a variety of other smaller items. But in general, we told you that our costs will ramp through the year as certain costs pick up through the year. And some of that is built into what you saw in the second quarter, and some of that will continue. And incentive accruals will stay higher through the back half of the year too, based on what our performance has been, assuming it stays at levels we\u2019ve had. The other question was\u2026. \nBryan Keane: That was regarding the client.\nVasant Prabhu: [Indiscernible] look, it\u2019s early to tell. You make assumptions on what\u2019s going to happen. And clearly, some things are already looking like they\u2019ll be in 2018, which we have factored into our thinking. But if you could more move into 2018? It\u2019s too early to tell.\nBryan Keane: Okay, thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Greene: Thanks, good afternoon. Just two questions quickly. Maybe for Vasant, I know you\u2019ve talked about the recontracting of the Europe deals, and that was part of the reason for the timing of the incentives. But more broadly, can you tell us sort of what proportion of the European volumes have been contracted or remain to be recontracted? And then another question that\u2019s not the same, but on pricing, how much of a pricing benefit did you recognize or see directionally in the quarter of that 25% of gross revenue? And did you see a full quarter impact on that pricing?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes I don\u2019t know if your second question is also about Europe. But as you\u2019ve said, as we\u2019ve said, I mean we indicated a while ago that we don\u2019t really talk about pricing actions we\u2019ve taken in any particular market. We sometimes talk about U.S. pricing actions because they are fairly visible to everyone. So we really \u2013 but those of you talk to people in Europe will get a sense of what is going on in that market. So from a price standpoint, there have been some actions taken and our yields our, we think, headed in a direction that you expect it to have them go. So that was as it relates to pricing. In terms of the process of replacing rebates with incentives, as we\u2019ve said several times, there are contracts in place, and these volumes are under contract. What we\u2019re trying to do is to make sure that these contracts are commercially competitive in a world where the issuers with whom these contracts have been done prior to the sale of Visa Europe when they were owners of Visa Europe, are still competitive. Because when they were owners of Visa Europe, are still competitive. Because when they were owners, they got a payment called rebates, which was more of an ownership payment. As those payments go away, we want to make sure that Visa commercial arrangements from a commercial standing remain competitive, so that when they come up for renewal, we have competitive pricing. So the contracts are in place. It\u2019s really the commercial terms that are being modified.\nGlenn Greene: Yes, that\u2019s really what I was asking. I was just trying, where are you in that, moving all these arrangements to commercial arrangements?\nAl Kelly: I think that we\u2019re in process. I think I said earlier, we\u2019re a little bit further behind than we thought we might be. But put it simply when you go get to each of these clients, have the discussions that are usually multiple discussions, and then getting it lawyered up, et cetera is taking a little bit longer than we thought. And so we still have a good amount of work ahead of us in the second half of the year. And that\u2019s why there\u2019s the impact that we talked about on clients incentives move timing being kind of what our estimate is of the $0.03.\nVasant Prabhu: Christine at this time we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Okay, and our last question is from Chris Donat from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is now open.\nChris Donat: Thanks for taking my question. Vasant, at the risk of annoying you with one more question on incentives, and think about 2018, is the safest place to start about our assumptions of what 2018 incentive ratio will be, the midpoint of the 2017 guidance? Because it was more like 19% for the first half of the fiscal year. It looks like it would be like 23% for the back half. And I know it\u2019s impossible to predict it accurately. We don\u2019t know all the terms. But anyway, I\u2019m just thinking is the midpoint of a full year for this year a reasonable place to start for next year.\nVasant Prabhu: Well it\u2019s too early for us to give you anything precise about next year. As you know, these things are best talked about in ranges. But we\u2019ve given you our best sense of what the range is likely to be this year and I believe that gives sense of what the range is likely to be this year and I believe Jack has told me that the ranges we\u2019ve given in the past, while one quarter or another, we may be below the range, perhaps one of these quarters will be above the range. We generally end up being in the range for the year. And that\u2019s our best sense of where the current range is for client incentives as a percent of gross revenues. Beyond that, it\u2019s too early to talk about 2018. We can tell you more about it as we get closer to the end of the year. \nChris Donat: Understood.\nJack Carsky: Thanks Chris. Thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has additional follow-up questions feel free to give myself or Joon or Victoria a call. Thanks again for joining.\nOperator: And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Let me start by saying how excited I am to be with all of you. I just completed my first quarter at Visa, and past my two-month mark as the Chief Executive Officer. I think, as many of you know, I've been a board member since early 2014, so I've been involved in the business and was a party in approving the company's strategy and priorities. I also understand the majority of the opportunities and challenges around the world. My objective from day one has been to make this CEO transition at Visa seamless for our clients, our partners, our employees, and our shareholders. I have no big plans to change our strategy in the short-term, but as a key player in a dynamic payments ecosystem, we certainly have to be prepared as necessary to adapt to our thinking as facts and circumstances change. Over the last couple of months, I've spent the majority of my time traveling to meet our valued clients, regulatory personnel and talented employees. During this time, I met with or talked to over 50 clients. I've also visited with regulators or government officials in nine countries and visited 12 of our global offices. I have to say it's been exhilarating and enjoyable. It has also reinforced my belief in our great global brand and the first-class group of clients that we have globally. Let me begin by sharing a few early observations since I joined the Visa team. Then I'll highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter and close with some thoughts around our strategic pillars as we move forward. First, I would say, we have a fantastic leadership team. I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with them and working with them on a day in and day out basis. I will also tell you that we have a talented group of employees after visiting with a number of them in our offices around the globe. We need to continue to foster a healthy culture that tracks, retains and develops the best talent to maintain this high level of company performance. Second, we certainly have strong relationships with our issuer clients, our acquirer clients and the merchant community of clients, and we're constantly looking for ways to build upon those. It's been very valuable for me to hear their perspectives on Visa and how we can be a better partner in addressing their business needs going forward. We need to identify areas where we can remove friction from the process, and enabling digital payments as we pursue partnerships. At the same time, we recognize that this industry is very competitive, and the regulatory environment continues to evolve in many markets around the world. Third, we're in a growth industry, and there's a huge opportunity in front of us. The global opportunity to digitize cash and check is enormous. We have a vibrant core business in developed regions with even more growth opportunities in the international and emerging markets with low penetration rates. Governments and emerging middle classes are leading the way to digitize more payments in developing countries, while e-commerce is displacing cash and check in developed countries. Through our focus on technological innovation and partnership development, Visa is well positioned for sustained growth going forward. As a market leader in payments technology, we're enabling new forms of digital commerce and supporting the new businesses in mobile payments, the Internet of Things, data security, and the sharing economy. Our global network connects over 16,000 financial institutions to over 44 million merchants, with strong commercial partnerships built over many years, and a brand that's recognized by consumers for acceptance, security and convenience. I'm gratified to see that the business strength and fundamentals that I knew as a board member continue to be realized in our financial results. With that, let me highlight some of these now. So in the fiscal quarter just ended, we saw a healthy overall growth in terms of payment volume, cross-border commerce, transactions, revenue and earnings leverage as the business performed better than our internal expectations. We grew net revenue by 25% and adjusted EPS by 23% versus prior year's adjusted results. Transaction growth, strong cross-border activity, higher currency volatility, and client incentive delays all contributed to our revenue outperformance. This is the second full quarter with Visa Europe in the results, which makes it a little more complicated, but Vasant will take time later to cover the financial results in greater detail. Our operational metrics are improving, and we're on track to meet our financial goals. In terms of co-brand partnerships, issuer renewals and other competitive deals, they are a normal course of business, and as usual, we've had very good success in the last quarter. We have a lot of momentum in the business and have exciting days ahead of us. We're executing on our 2017 operating plan, and are pleased with the progress to date. When I look out longer term, we remain committed to our strategy in the six guiding pillars, three of which I look at as foundational, and three of which are keys to growth. The foundational elements of our strategy are first and foremost to retain and attract the best people. In my mind, and based on my experience, success starts there. Winning teams and organizations have the best people, so we need to build upon the solid foundation and high performing culture we have here at Visa. We continue to strive to be an employer of choice where we can constantly attract the best talent, develop our people, and recognize their achievements as we are clearly doing excellent and wonderful things here. Second is transforming technology. We want to constantly be on the leading edge and push the pace of innovation. As part of extending our network and enabling easier access, we're pushing toward open access software for our clients and partners. We're providing an open platform for developers to access our APIs to quickly launch new products and experiences. We're adding technical resources in many locations around the world, and also building a European innovation center in the UK that will open at the end of this month. The third foundational element is championing security. It is an imperative that there is a high level of trust in the payments ecosystem, and we are committed to be an industry leader when it comes to security. One way we're doing that is through tokenization. We continue to make excellent progress with Visa Token Service, which is now live in 27 countries, and more than 1,300 financial institution partners are participating globally. We've enabled launches of many financial institutions' wallets, as well as the various pays in several additional countries in this past quarter. Now, let me turn to the three growth elements of the strategy, the first being expanding access to our network and services globally. Expanding and providing access to our network drives value for our clients and partners, consumers, merchants and governments. Around the world, we're developing supporting new products and methods of acceptance, while recognizing local market conditions. Through these efforts, we have provided payment accounts to countless numbers of people who previously didn't have access to the formal financial system. Second, growth element of our strategy is deepening partnerships. Partnerships are critical in the payments world, and we strive to be the best possible partner we can be to enable growth opportunities for all parties in the ecosystem. We need to continue to build close relationships with our issuing partners. Likewise, it is very important that we work hard and demonstrate a commitment to our acquirers and the merchant community in each market, and find ways to deliver additional value there. Being a trusted partner is a key to our business success. So we always want to look to strengthen these relationships, and we will continue to do just that. And the third element is digital expansion. E-commerce enabled by mobile and other form factors is a significant opportunity, and we are definitely investing behind it. As payments move from the physical to digital world, we're leading the way in developing solutions for our clients, our partners and consumers. One great example of this is Visa Checkout. We now have over 18 million consumer accounts in 23 countries, and over 1,500 financial institutional partners participating around the world. More than 300,000 online merchants have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $173 billion in addressable volume. Another key area for Visa is the acceleration of international markets. The integration of Visa Europe is tracking well. It's still in the early innings, but we're encouraged by the progress and see meaningful growth opportunities. During the quarter, we continued our focus on local market priorities alongside client engagement. The vast majority of our payments volume in Europe remains under contract. The European market continues to represent a large opportunity to displace cash, and we are accelerating digital innovation in Europe by continuing to rollout our token service in several markets as well as supporting many digital wallets. A number of people have asked about the China market opportunity. Visa remains committed to China for the long-term, and we want to deepen our partnerships with our clients and partners to advance economic growth. We look forward to the opportunity to formally submit our license application, however we're still awaiting additional clarifications from the government before we can apply. It's our intent to move very quickly to set up our processing infrastructure once we have greater clarity from the PBOC around the timelines for their decision in granting licenses. The move to a more cashless economy in India also represents a large opportunity. Concurrent with other measures, the new government has implemented measures to incent merchants and consumers to move to digital payments. These new measures include capped POS terminal charges, no POS import tax and duties, and in the last quarter we've seen nearly 75% increase in payments volume in India, and more than twice the number of processed transactions. We're working with a number of key stakeholders to sustain the momentum to drive digital payments in the Indian economy. Examples include working with issuers to raise awareness and drive debit activation. We're also working with acquirers and merchants on digital acceptance solutions like mVisa to rapidly expand acceptance, and with key government bodies to facilitate longer term ecosystem growth. It is early days, but we're excited about the opportunity to expand electronic payments to consumers. Let me now share some thoughts on managing our capital and delivering shareholder value. Our number one priority with capital is to identify and find ways to grow our business. This can come organically or through acquisitions. One example of the latter is the acquisition of CardinalCommerce which closed yesterday. This acquisition helps our clients and merchant partners to accelerate digital payments in commerce by improving online payment security. It builds on our strength in the sector, and augments issuer services and our CyberSource capabilities. In this dynamic payments ecosystem, we need to invest to drive future growth and maintain our market-leading position. Second, we will continue to deliver value by returning excess cash to our shareholders. In this last fiscal quarter, we returned nearly $2.2 billion, consisting of $1.8 billion through share repurchases and nearly $400 million through dividends. As we've stated before, we have accelerated our share repurchases to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe acquisition. We will continue to be prudent as we think about ways of managing and allocating our capital. Lastly, we plan to maintain a healthy dialogue and good relationships with our investor community. I hope to meet and spend time with many of you as we move through the year. And to that end, we are in the planning stages to hold an Investor Day in June, so we will come back to you shortly once the dates and locations are confirmed. So as we begin this New Year, I'm excited about the many opportunities ahead. We're off to a really good start in our fiscal first quarter. I feel great about the future of Visa. And with that, let me turn it over to Vasant to cover some of the financial details.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Thank you, Al. Fiscal 2017 is off to a strong start. First quarter revenue and EPS exceeded our expectations driven by accelerating fundamentals, which more than offset the drag from exchange rate shifts. On a GAAP basis, fiscal first quarter net revenues were up 25%, and EPS up 7%. Net income for the first quarter was $2.1 billion, and EPS $0.86 per diluted share. Adjusting for the $255 million non-cash gain in last year's first quarter from the write-off of the Visa Europe put liability, EPS was up 23%. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 3 percentage points. There were four key drivers of our Q1 outperformance; first, constant dollar payment volume growth stepped up between 1 to 2 percentage points in most geographies; second, normalized for the impact of Visa Europe, the cross-border recovery accelerated by 2 percentage points globally from 10% to 12%, once again the acceleration was broad-based; third, normalized for the impact of Visa Europe, process transaction growth picked up by 1 point from 12% to 13%, driven significantly by India as well as the U.S.; fourth, timing of client incentives and delays in expenses added almost $0.03 to our Q1 results. Strong business fundamentals more than offset the negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a weakening euro. The balance between strong business fundamentals and unfavorable exchange rate shifts will drive our results as we look ahead to the rest of fiscal year 2017. A couple of other points to note before I get into the details of our Q1 results and our outlook for the year. We did not issue $2 billion in debt as we had planned. We did issue $567 million in commercial paper to fund our stock buyback and operating cash needs. We have over $8 billion of offshore cash, which could be repatriated if it can be done tax efficiently. We will wait to see what the new administration's plans for permitting cash repatriation are before we issue a longer-term debt. In parallel, we continue to work on other strategies to bring cash back to the U.S. Until there's clarity on this front, we plan to issue commercial paper or short-term debt to fund our buyback and other onshore cash needs. We bought back 22.3 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $79.77 for $1.8 billion in the first quarter. We have $3.9 billion remaining in our stock buyback authorization. Moving now to a review of our key business drivers in the first quarter; U.S. payments volumes grew 12.4% in Q1 as credit grew 20.2% helped by Costco and USAA. U.S. debit grew 4.6% helped by USAA debit conversion, but hurt by Interlink volumes. Interlink volumes were down due to lapping a significant win in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, as well as PIN debit routing choices by acquirers and merchants. Excluding Interlink volumes, the U.S. debit growth rate stepped up by 3 points due to USAA and rising gas prices. Gas prices added approximately 1 point to both credit and debit payment volume growth in the U.S. As reported, Q1 international payment volumes grew 70.5% in constant dollars. The step-down in the growth rate from the last quarter is a result of the exclusion of co-badge volumes in Europe. As you know, effective June 9, 2016, Article 8 of the EU Interchange Fee Regulation states that payment networks cannot impose reporting requirement or the obligation to pay fees on payment transactions where their payment brand is present, but their network is not used. Prior to this regulation, Visa collected a small service fee in a few countries, particularly France, on domestic payment transactions where Visa cards are co-badged with a domestic network. Clients in Europe continue to report co-badge volume through the quarter ended September 2016. However, effective the December 2016 quarter, Visa co-badge volumes in Europe are no longer included in our reported payment volumes. Item 2 in our Operational Performance Data package will help you adjust for this change. As you can see, excluding co-badge volume, European payment volume growth stepped up from 7% last quarter to 9%. There was strength across Europe and especially in the UK. Payment volume growth rate in Asia was up 1.6 percentage points driven by India, Japan and Australia. Our CEMEA region growth rate was higher by over 3 points helped by the Middle East and some improvement in Africa. The only region with a slowdown in growth was Latin America, pulled down by continuing weakness in Brazil. Adding in Europe to last year's payment volumes and adjusting for co-badge volumes, in other words on a comparable and normalized basis, constant dollar global payment volume growth accelerated by 1.5 percentage points in Q1 versus the last quarter. On a reported basis, cross-border volumes grew 140% driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis, constant dollar cross-border growth globally was 12%, up 2 points from the last quarter. This information is provided in Item 3 of our Operational Performance Data package. U.S. cross-border growth in constant dollars hit double-digits for the first time since the first quarter of 2014. The strong dollar drove robust outbound commerce from the U.S., especially into Mexico, Canada and the UK. Our large U.S. acquired business was stable, benefiting from commerce in from Canada and parts of Latin America. The weak pound is driving significant inbound commerce into the UK from all parts of the globe. Euro zone cross-border growth rates remained healthy helped by a weakening euro. Cross-border commerce was strong across most of Asia, especially outbound from Australia and Southeast Asia. Other high growth corridors were outbound commerce from Russia and Eastern Europe. Overall, the cross-border business was an important contributor to our Q1 outperformance. On a reported basis, global process transactions grew 44%, driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis, global process transactions grew 13%, up 1 point from the last quarter. U.S. process transactions grew 11% due to Costco and USAA. Demonetization in India drove the increase in international process transaction growth. European process transactions were stable. Through January 28, U.S. payment volumes are up almost 13% in constant dollars. Normalized for Visa Europe, constant dollar cross-border volumes grew 13% and process transaction growth was 14%. As you can see, first quarter growth trends remain intact so far in Q2. A quick review of Q1 financial results. Service revenues grew 17%. Service revenue growth was helped by the announced price increase on U.S. acquired debit card service fees, offset by negative currency translation impact. Service revenue growth is lower than payment volume growth we reported in the September quarter, reflecting the fact that service revenue yields are substantially lower in Europe than in the legacy Visa business. Data processing revenues grew 28%. Once again, transaction revenue growth is lower than process transaction growth reflecting the lower yield on European process transaction relative to the legacy Visa business. India demonetization doubled transaction volumes, but did not contribute much to revenues in Q1. As you may be aware, in response to a request from the Indian Government, Visa voluntarily charged no fees for processing through December 31, 2016. International revenues grew 44%. This is up from the September quarter growth rate driven by cross-border volume acceleration, higher than average currency volatility, offset by an unfavorable exchange rate impact. Other revenues grew 2%. Other revenues no longer include Visa Europe license fees. Client incentives came in well below our guidance range of 20.5% to 21.5%. This is all due to timing of deals being done in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Many of these renewals will be executed in the second quarter, shifting these client incentive payments from the first quarter into the second quarter. Lower client incentives due to delayed deals added approximately $0.02 to our EPS in Q1. Expenses grew 16% due to the inclusion of Visa Europe. There were some shifts in marketing and technology spending to upcoming quarters. In addition, as Europe completed the consultation process, new hiring, growth projects and integration activities were modestly delayed. Delayed expenses added $0.01 to the first quarter EPS. These expenses will be incurred through the balance of the year. Our tax rate was 30.5%, driving EPS of $0.86, up 23% on an adjusted basis. As we look ahead, two significant countervailing trends will drive our results; strong business momentum, especially cross-border growth is a tailwind; the strengthening of the dollar and the weakening of the Euro are headwinds. The cross-border recovery is broad-based and accelerated in the first quarter. We hope this will be sustained. This is a higher yielding revenue stream which improves our revenue mix. Continued strength of the dollar is a risk to monitor. Treasury volatility staying above long-term averages as it did in the first quarter will also help. The broad acceleration in payment volumes globally is another reason for optimism. The counter trend is exchange rates. Based on spot rates and the forward curve, the dollar has strengthened around 4% versus our major currencies since September. The stronger dollar is a stiffer headwind than we expected. Our hedging program will offset some of the negative impact. The euro has weakened almost 5% versus the dollar since September. Since we did not own Visa Europe until late June, we are not hedged on our euro exposure. In addition, the euro is now a functional currency for us, and we can only do economic hedges which could add volatility rather than dampen it. As such, we may choose to stay unhedged on our euro exposure. The weakening of the euro will hurt Europe results as reported in dollars more than we expected last September. This countertrend of favorable business fundamentals and unfavorable exchange rate shifts drive our fiscal year 2017 outlook. For the second quarter, we are assuming payment volume momentum will be sustained. The strong dollar could cause some moderation in cross-border growth. Client incentive spend will step up with the deals that are shifting into the second quarter from the first quarter. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be well within our guidance range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Expense growth rates are expected to be higher than the first quarter as we ramp up spending in Europe, and delayed initiatives in technology and marketing move into the second quarter. For the full year of fiscal year 2017, we are reaffirming the ranges we previously provided for nominal revenue and EPS growth. We expect that stronger business fundamentals will offset stiffer currency headwinds. We have increased the likely currency translation drag on our reported revenue and EPS growth rates by 1 point versus prior estimates. While client incentives were lower than expected in the first quarter, we expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be very much in the 20.5% to 21.5% range for the year. Other elements of our outlook for the year, operating margins and tax rates, remain unchanged. We continue to work on tax and repatriation strategies related to the Visa Europe acquisition as we've told you before. If and when we are able to execute a tax re-organization, we will let you know what its impact will be on future tax rates and cash debt management plans. Visa Europe revenue and operating income are tracking well despite the negative impact of the weaker euro. Integration plans are modestly behind schedule due to a longer consultation process. With the employee consultation process now complete, the re-organization is being executed. Technology integration planning is on track. Discussions continue with clients to ensure that our pricing stays competitive post the elimination of rebates, as well as to extend existing contracts. Even as this process is underway, it is important to note that the vast majority of our volume in Europe remains under contract. In summary, fiscal year 2017 is off to a good start. Strong business fundamentals are helping overcome unfavorable exchange rates. We hope this trend will continue through the year. With that, I'll turn this back to Jack.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, Vasant. At this time, May, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. First question is from Bob Napoli. Your line is now open.\nRobert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Al, congratulations on a very nice quarter. You really have accelerated momentum since you've become CEO. So congratulations on that.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Team effort, but thank you, Bob.\nRobert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: The question is on client incentives. Just the change in client incentives from last year to this year, what percentage of that is from the integration \u2013 from the Visa Europe acquisition versus other items like Costco or just general business conditions? And do you expect, as we look to fiscal 2018-2019, to see that percentage continue to increase?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Yeah, as we said on our call last quarter, we said that it was roughly half due to Europe, and some of it is how the accounting works when you remove rebates and replace them with client incentives. And the rest was driven by Costco, USAA, and also renewals that we expect this year. So nothing has changed much on those fronts.\nRobert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: As far as the longer-term outlook?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Sorry?\nRobert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Just the trend into 2018. Sorry.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Well, I think it's too early to talk about that. We'll certainly get into all that as we get to later in the year and talk about next year. But as you know, we're tracking below our range in the first quarter, so you should assume that it'll catch up in future quarters this year.\nRobert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, Bob.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: We have from KBW, Sanjay Sakhrani. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. I was wondering if we could get more color on where you guys are with the pricing initiatives in Europe for the year.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: We're moving ahead with plans we had. And some of it, as we've told you before, we don't plan to announce them per se in calls like these. Certainly, in the market in Europe, people are aware of what we have done. As we said in our comments, we are engaged with all our issuers and acquirers in Europe on all these issues. There are ongoing discussions. We're happy with how things are going. And as far as that's concerned, we're very much on track in terms of everything we wanted to do.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: We have from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, guys. So just in light of the longer consultation period in Europe and a little bit of the delay in the integration, is 2% to 3% EPS accretion from Visa Europe still the right number?\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Yes, I think that's certainly what we're continuing to target, Jason.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: I'm sorry, we have George Mihalos. Your line is open, from Cowen.\nGeorge Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Nice to see the encouraging trends pretty much across the globe. Just curious within the U.S. market, I know there's a number of deals that are still ramping up. But sort of on an apples-to-apples basis, are you seeing an acceleration on the part of your issuers in trying to push more credit products and maybe the volume you're seeing again on sort of a same store sales basis ex-Costco and USAA?\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: I would say that, given the continued amount of attention reward products are getting, we're certainly seeing that our issuers are very focused on the credit card segment for sure.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Yeah, in general, credit growth rates when you normalize for all things that are, as you said, adds to our business, the underlying growth trend is higher in credit than debit, and is roughly stable quarter-over-quarter.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please, May.\nOperator: Next question is from Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Yes. Hi. Thanks. I was hoping with all the noise in the numbers, you could help us see through to some level of organic growth for the European franchise. Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: We've tried to do our best to give you the business drivers. So if you go to our Operational Performance package, what you'll see is that European payment volumes grew 2 points faster than they did last quarter. So it was 7% growth last quarter, 9% this quarter, and that is Item 2 in the Operational Performance Data. So you can see that. And then in the commentary, we talked about cross-border being quite strong in Europe. We're seeing a huge amount of inbound commerce into the UK, certainly helped by the pound. Generally speaking, cross-border across Europe is quite strong, helped by the weakening euro. Europe is definitely a beneficiary of a lot of inbound commerce. And then in terms of transactions, I think you heard us say in our comments that transaction growth rates in Europe was stable. We're moving very well in terms of all the other actions we want to take in Europe as it relates to costs and so on. So all-in-all, as Al said earlier, we feel very good about both Europe's financial performance and also the accretion that we anticipated this year. We are on track to do as well as or better than we had assumed we would his year.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Thank you.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, Craig. Next question.\nOperator: Next is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Just a little bit of a follow up on that and then on the incentive side again. First, can you help us understand, I mean, is there a way that you can just kind of tell us what the pro forma revenue growth rate would have been had you owned Visa Europe this time last year? And then part of your guidance obviously seems predicated on, as you said Vasant, incentives being notably higher than the run rate in both fourth quarter and now the first quarter was the same as a percentage of growth. I guess just, I mean, you had USAA and Costco both in there. I know a lot of the European banks were done already. I guess, just why would it increase at that level? Thanks again, guys.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Darrin, I'll start with it, there were a couple of deals that we thought would close in the first quarter that have just drifted into the second quarter, and a couple of them are big deals outside of the United States. And so we have a pretty good insight to what the second quarter is going to look like based on the fact that these deals are either have closed or were at the very last level of red lining the deal. So we have pretty good insight. So I think the guidance that you heard from Vasant is good guidance. In terms of the first part of your question, we're not in a position to start getting into a lot of the detail on Visa Europe individually. I think we're very excited to have moved to kind of a one Visa concept that as quickly as we possibly can. We're going to be happy to be able to talk about it on a total global company basis.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Yeah. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to sort of divide up the report, the financial reports into, this is Visa Europe's performance separately. We try to help you as much as we could in the business drivers to give you a feel for how Europe is performing and how the business is actually performing on an organic basis if you adjust for Europe. And then I think the other question you asked was, why would we expect incentives to be higher this year than the fourth quarter of last year. It's a variety of reasons, some of which we walked through on the call last time. Someway it has to do with how the accounting for the rebates worked post the acquisition of Visa Europe. It's Visa Europe coming into our numbers. It's Costco and USAA being in there for the full year. And it's some of these renewals that we were anticipating this year that Al mentioned. So what we told you is what we still expect, and that's why we indicated that what you saw in the first quarter was a result of some delays, but the overall full-year expectation for client incentives does not change.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, May.\nOperator: Next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. I'll ask on the debit routing modification that caught a lot of news when it was announced in December. With you I guess taking up guidance here doesn't seem to be a big issue from a P&L standpoint. Just curious if you can maybe comment on how impactful that modification or clarification has been or could be to your P&L. Thanks.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Per the request of the FTC, we made the clarification. But I think that for the most part we were acting in the appropriate fashion. But we see very little impact of any meaningful level on the business whatsoever.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, May.\nOperator: Next is from Dan Perlin, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDaniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. So a quick question on India. You talked about significantly increasing transactions but not driving much revenue, and part of that was the function of the Indian Government asking you guys to kind of keep prices subdued for a little period of time. I'm wondering, as you think about the guidance that you just gave us, are you assuming more normalized pricing in that horizon, and if not, when would you expect that to somewhat normalize in your opinion? Thanks.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: I think we're assuming some pricing in that model. I don't think we're \u2013 I would say, we're being fairly conservative in what we expect to be able to gain in terms of revenue. This is, I think for us very importantly, and strategically this is a build opportunity that the government really has put out there in front of us. And so in my mind, at this point I'm much more focused on capitalizing on this opportunity and investing heavily behind driving both awareness for consumers and incentive for merchants to get signed up. There's only a very fractional amount of the merchant community in India that is enabled today to be able to accept electronic or digitized payments, and we want to try to get that number up as much as we possibly can. So I think when you consider the economics of the investments we'll make in India, plus a fairly conservative pricing, it's certainly not going to be a market in this fiscal year that's going to drive a lot of profit for us. But I think, it's a great year for us to make sure that we do everything we can in one of the two largest population countries in the world to get as good a position as we can to help us over the next decade.\nDaniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Next question, please.\nOperator: We have one from Ken Bruce from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Good afternoon. My question also relates to Europe. I'm hoping you might be able or willing to compare and contrast the go-to-market strategy with the issuers, and what you're doing or what you plan to do in Europe differs from the U.S. You kind of pointed out that you've got a very incentive driven market here in the U.S. and you're able \u2013 and you've been very successful in terms of using the interchange framework here to drive a lot of issuer wins. Can you maybe just help us understand how you're attacking Europe differently?\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: So I think, Ken, Europe is almost a number of different segments in and of itself. I mean, the Europe for us right now is hugely dominated by the UK where we have most of the debit market taken up. Then there's four or five other markets across the EU where we have a reasonable amount of business. And then there's a number of big economies, certainly Germany being one example, where it's still a heavy cash society, where I think we've got a lot of opportunity in the medium to longer term to see more of commerce digitized or in some form of electronic form. Europe is also different than the United States in terms of processing, where there are in certain markets domestic processing schemes. And we've got a strategy to try to win more processing volume in Europe as well. So we're engaging, I would say, hopefully, what I believe to be a thoughtful segmented approach with different issuers and different acquirers on a country-by-country basis because each of these countries is different, and having spent most of my life as an issuer on the issuing side of the business, I know full well that the issuing business is really a local consumer business, and you've got to figure out the right strategy on a market-by-market basis. So we're not going to have kind of a pan-European strategy. It's really going to be a market-by-market strategy within Europe.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nLisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Al, I just wanted to ask you if you wouldn't mind commenting on two areas that you did not explicitly mentioned in the strategy that you laid out; one is Visa's expansion into adjacent markets like remittance or potentially into B2B, and what your plans are there; and then, secondly, when you mentioned partnerships, you did not call out the big tech firms like Apple, PayPal, Alipay, et cetera. And so I'm just curious if you have a comment there. Thanks.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: On the latter, Lisa, I think I maybe shorthanded it, but I did say that we're working with all the pays, and so it's all of those pays. And we're in different stages of relationship with all of them. But obviously they're increasingly important people in the payments ecosystem as mobile devices become an important form factor in the digital world. So absolutely we're working with them. Look, I think there's a lot of vectors for growth for Visa, and the whole commercial space and disbursement of different kinds and business-to-business kinds of payments are very much on our radar screen. We have a group of people headed by a very senior person who's dedicated to this space now. We're not as strong a player as we'd like to be, but we are stacked up and spending a lot of time on this issue. And it's something that we do want to get a stronger position in the whole commercial and B2B space.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next is from Moshe Katri, Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.\nMoshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. One, can we get an update on the PayPal agreement in terms of where we are? And then in that context, going back to Visa Europe, have we seen any change in issuer attrition while you're renewing your book there? Thanks a lot.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Well, in terms of the latter question first, I think either in mine or Vasant's remarks, we talked about the fact that a lot of our issuer volume in Visa Europe is under contract. So we actually bought Visa Europe at a time where we've got a pretty good book of business that's going to be with us for a while. I mean, that said, as I said in my remarks, I'm very, very much a client-focused person, and we're going to work hard with every single one of our clients in Europe as well as around the world. But we do have a lot of good long-term relationships locked up. In terms of PayPal, I'd say that everything is progressing as planned. Our issuer clients who are very important to us, obviously, are engaged with PayPal, and they're working to migrate customers off of ACH back onto their cards. PayPal has been executing marketing campaigns and changes in their user experience to make it much easier for Visa card holders to pay with their Visa card, and to make it their default payment option.\nMoshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question from Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities.\nEric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thanks very much. My question, Vasant, is just on the use of CP and short-term debt rather than the debt issuance that you had planned. What motivated that decision, particularly given that the rate environment presumably would be pretty good still for term debt?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Well, the fact is that we have offshore cash. And let's say we issue $2 billion of long-term debt, and we're able to repatriate somewhere in the region of $8 billion of offshore cash either because there's a change in the rules that allows it to happen tax efficiently, or because we are able to, as part of our \u2013 some thoughts and ideas we have on the re-organization in Europe, we're able to repatriate cash. We will have more cash than we need to keep for settlement guarantees and all that. And that excess cash is available. So that's the reason to wait a bit and see whether we want to use our own cash rather than lock in more long-term debt. I mean, this is something we monitor on a regular basis, and if there's any changes on that front, we'll certainly let you now.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, Eric. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. I just want to ask in the U.S. debit market, you guys talked about some headwinds due to the PIN debit routing choices. Is that a shift from Interlink to other EFT networks, or are you guys seeing or think you're going to see a switch in the market towards more PIN versus Signature? And then just quickly, secondly on cross-border volume, what are you guys expecting exactly in the guidance, continue at these elevated levels or to fall back down?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: So on the first question, what we talked about was really that our Signature Debit business actually stepped up in growth rate by 3 points this quarter, and that's driven a lot by USAA. So really all we were referring to was switch away from our PIN debit volume, which would be Interlink volume. Some of it is because the Interlink volume declined this quarter as it did last quarter, some of which we told you was because we were lapping a significant win from the fourth quarter of 2015, and then some of it was because volume moved to other PIN debit networks. So it was all around volumes away from our PIN debit network, or hard comparisons for our PIN debit volumes versus prior years. So that was the answer on that one. What was the other question?\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Cross-border volumes.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Oh yes, cross-border volume, I think as I said in my comments, for the first 28 days of January, cross-border volume growth was certainly holding up. But the dollar has strengthened, so our go- forward assumptions assume that the cross-border growth rate is healthy but perhaps a little bit of a moderation in the rate of growth than what we saw in the first quarter. So we'll wait and see.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: From Jason Deleeuw, Piper Jaffray.\nJason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. I was hoping to get an update on Visa Checkout, what some of the current investments are right now on the consumer merchant side. And then what's the longer-term vision for Visa Checkout and how does that fit in with the partnerships with the other pays? Thank you.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Well, we think of Visa Checkout as a platform, and it's all part of us trying to make sure that we're a leader in terms of bringing potential solutions to the marketplace. We feel very good about the fact that we now are up to 18 million users signed up for Visa Checkout. It happens to also be a very active base of customers in terms of usage of Visa Checkout. We are facilitating more of our issuer clients to put their products side-by-side, embedded within Visa Checkout. And at this stage, the pays are out there obviously doing their thing as well, and we're going to continue to work with them. I think it's too early to tell how all of this is going to shake out. My personal view is that there are too many wallets out there. Consumers are not going to ultimately want to have 50 wallets, and we're not necessarily anxious to be in the wallet business per se, but we're anxious to take advantage of us being a trusted acceptance mark in the payments eco-space, and want to be able to make sure that we're taking a leading position in establishing Visa as a trusted mark, and as an important partner to our issuers in terms of them trying to establish as much volume as they can get in the digital space.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Next question, May.\nOperator: Next from Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the impact broadly that you expect from the Trump administration and other Congressional policies, both in terms of tax policy, regulatory impacts, or other impacts, and maybe talk about some of the largest positive or largest potentially negative things you can see in the future.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Jim, I think, it's too early to tell. I mean, we're barely two weeks into this presidency. And while the President has been active with executive orders, I think that as things start to settle down and we get into more specific policies and his cabinet is confirmed and in place and the legislature gets going, I think it remains to be seen what happens. I will tell you this, that we have a world-class group of government relations people who are already fully engaged as much as we can in the relevant conversations in Washington. But I think there's things that relate to trade, relate to taxes, all of which could play into our business. But I honestly just think it's too early to start to speculate. And we're certainly not building anything into our plans positively or negatively for that matter related to any policies that might come out. But I can assure you that we're watching it very closely.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, Jim. May, next question.\nOperator: From James Faucette, Morgan Stanley.\nJames E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Wanted to kind of follow up on that. You talked about having visited with a lot of customers as well as government officials, et cetera, around the world since you've taken on the CEO role. Can you talk and summarize a little bit what the particular regulators were asking from Visa, and kind of what their objectives are, and how Visa can help fulfill those? And I guess, kind of what's happened in India as it creates an interesting lens through which to view that. So maybe elaborate a little bit on some of those relations, et cetera. Thanks.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: So I've talked to regulators in both very developed markets as well as regulators in developing and emerging markets, and I think the content and tenor of the conversations is a bit different depending upon who you talk to. I mean, there are governments around the world who very much are seeking a close partnership with us. Their desire is learning how they can be helped in moving to a much more of a cashless society, how they can get many more of the people in their countries actually engaged in the financial system, how there could be greater financial literacy. And so in those particular cases, I would say that we're trying to take a very active role, and in some cases a very proactive role, in helping shape how the government thinks about what steps they ought to take. Including, by the way, in some cases working with governments to have them be a role model by making sure that they are moving away from paper in favor of a digitized world. So for example, in Egypt, instead of vouchers being handed out, giving people prepaid cards so that they could in fact begin to start to have an experience with plastic. And what that does is it automatically starts setting up and incenting a whole merchant network to get built out as these people have to have a place to go, be able to spend their money that's on these prepaid cards, and merchants in this particular example who are involved in food and beverage, for instance, want to be able to get their fair share of that volume so they're very quickly incented to get to a point where they can accept plastic and be signed up as a merchant. In more developed countries, there are countries where the ship has sailed, and they've made decision on interchange as an example. Probably Australia and Europe being two real examples there where, I think, now it's just a matter of what does that mean and how does that play out for issuers and consumers in those markets. I think, there are countries that I've talked to where there's pressure on both sides of, say, the finance ministers in countries where some of the merchant coalitions want to see lower interchange, but in markets, for example, where reward propositions are big on plastic, or on whatever form of payment vehicle it is, the consumer is going to get hurt in terms of those programs if interchange is lowered, because it's a two-sided market. The economics have to \u2013 there's only so much economics, and people will do what they'll have to do to make sure that they stay economically viable. So I think there's a number of markets where truthfully the government is trying to stay out of it and kind of let the free market system take over. And I think, in general, there's markets where the regulators are taking a very, very active role and in other cases I think a much more passive role. Again, often quite different depending on the specific country we're talking about.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, James. May, at this time we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We have Tom McCrohan from CLSA.\nThomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. You've covered so much ground on the call, I'll just ask a simple question. The total integration cost of $450 million to $500 million over the next three years, any change to that. Thank you.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Yeah, we said it was $80 million this year. We'll wait and see how things go and give you any updates as we get towards the end of the year on future outlook. But at this point, really we wouldn't say anything different about the future. We expect that we will spend the $80 million we thought we would spend this year. Thank you.\nJack Carsky - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to call Investor Relations. And when we have a set date for our June Investor Day, we will put that out in the public domain.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.: Mike, thank you and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Our performance remained strong in fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue growth was 12%, as all our key business drivers remained robust despite the stronger dollar. Payments volume growth on a constant dollar basis of 11% was right in line with last quarter, with strength in the U.S. offsetting a slowdown in dual-branded card volume in China. Excluding China, our payment volume growth would have modestly accelerated versus the last quarter. Cross-border on a constant dollar basis was 10%, same as the prior quarter. Processed transaction growth was consistent with last quarter at 12%. Expense growth, adjusted for a donation of available-for-sale investment securities to the Visa Foundation, was 12%, primarily driven by personnel-related investments. Adjusted EPS growth was 34%. We also returned approximately $2.1 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter, consisting of $1.6 billion of share repurchases and $500 million through dividends. Looking back on this entire fiscal year of 2018, our global leading network connecting issuers and merchants got stronger on a number of dimensions. The number of cards, including virtual cards, increased by about 80 million to 3.3 billion. Total Visa volume surpassed a record $11 trillion, driven by 182 billion transactions, or an average of 500 million transactions every single day during fiscal 2018. Payments volume totaled over $8.2 trillion, increasing by almost $900 billion year over year. Our payments volume growth was strong across the globe, with double-digit growth in constant dollars in all regions except Europe, which grew at 9.2%. And with our payments volume growing twice as fast as global PCE, Visa's penetration of global purchased PCE increased by 0.5 point to over 16% this year. Transactions processed totaled $124 billion, up 12%, lifting our processing penetration by 1 point globally. A very important part of measuring the health of our network is found in the activity and results relative to merchants and issuers. In 2018, merchant locations increased by 7 million or 15%, reaching a total of 54 million locations globally. And relative to issuers, deal activity picked up in Q4, particularly in Europe, where we completed the shift to commercial client contracts. Beyond Europe, during the full year we completed new agreements with clients, driving roughly 15% of our total payments volume. By the way, in fiscal 2019, we're expecting more deal activity with new agreements for clients who drive roughly 20% of our global payments volume, including Europe. The fact that 20% of our volume is up for renewal is not surprising given that our typical contract length is five years. Now let me talk about how we've expanded our breadth and reach in 2018, which has set us up well for the future. I will share a few highlights from across the globe and then provide insights into how we are driving growth into our digital solutions, accelerating adoption of our acceptance technology, and expanding into new key segments. So let me start with some regional highlights, starting in Europe. The technical migration to our global VisaNet platform was completed in late September, with the authorizations components finished following the clearing and settlement migration, which completed in the first quarter. Our European clients have now access to all our global capabilities. In fact, more than 60 clients are already utilizing at least one of our advanced risk services, having just completed the migration. This was a very large effort that required sustained vigilance on our part to ensure there was no disruption to our clients. So we really couldn't be happier about the execution, and we're now moving forward with one global platform. Our European clients also now enjoy the highest level of security and protection from our global cybersecurity systems and processes. In fact, earlier today we inaugurated our Cyber Fusion center in London, making it our second fusion center globally. The conversion of the European client contracts to commercial incentives is now officially complete, as we signed the last remaining deals during the quarter after agreeing to terms earlier in the year. We are very pleased with the outcome of this effort, as there was a lot of risk in opening well over 100 client contracts in such a short period of time. As we have said previously, the amount of business we retained was better than we expected at the time of the acquisition. As we get past the integration, one of our priorities in Europe is gaining momentum with FinTechs by moving faster, being more flexible, and establishing an investment fund to provide financial support. This quarter, we are beginning to have more success with FinTechs both in terms of signings but also agreements still to be contracted. We signed agreements this quarter with Revolut, YAYA in the UK, Solaris in Germany, and G2A in Central Eastern Europe. Let me now move to Asia-Pacific, where Q4 was an active quarter for deal renewals and wins across the region. A few examples include NTUC FairPrice co-brand, which is Singapore's largest supermarket chain, The Mall Group co-brand, one of Thailand's largest retailers, and the AirAsia co-brand in Malaysia. In New Zealand, Kiwi Bank selected Visa as its long-term exclusive partner for all its payments products, which brings us to four of the top five issuers now exclusive long-term Visa partners in that market. In China, we renewed the dual-brand card relationships with China Construction Bank and CITIC Bank, as well as we won the new prepaid deal with Ctrip. Building a new debit business in Japan continues to be one of our top priorities for the region given the size of the opportunity. We now have over 8 million debit cards in the Japanese market, up over 40% since last year, across 23 different issuers. In India, we renewed deals with many of the leading banks in the market, including the State Bank of India, HDFC, ICICI, Axis Bank, and Kotak Mahindra. And we are confident that these deals will contribute to further strengthening of our market leadership position across debit and credit products. Regarding the India data localization mandate, over the last six months Visa has been working towards implementing a solution to comply with the RBI's requirements. As of October 15, we are storing data locally, where we can also facilitate the RBI's requirement of access to Indian cardholder payment transaction data. We have submitted a detailed status update and action plan to the RBI, including how we will re-architect our existing global processing systems to fully comply with the data only-in-India requirement. Our technology teams are working virtually around the clock to complete our solution with minimal impact to our clients and our cardholders. In Latin America, we also had several co-brand wins, including Decolar in Brazil, which is the largest online travel agency in Latin America, with an affluent customer base. Also in Brazil, we signed 10-year agreements with Bradesco, one of our largest issuers in the market, and CREDZ, a processor and local private label brand that will convert about 1 million cards to Visa contactless. In Argentina, one of our largest markets in Latin America, we will begin processing 100% of our domestic transactions in January of 2019. This enables us to provide all of the value-added services, cyber capabilities, and network reliability to our clients in addition to future innovations that we will add to our global platform. Adding all of Argentina to VisaNet will increase our processing penetration of domestic transactions in Latin America by more than 10 percentage points. And finally, one quick but important point on CEMEA, airline co-brands are an important portfolios in the Middle East to capture the travel of the most affluent consumers. This quarter we had a number of wins, including Emirates in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, as well as the HBL Qatar Airways portfolio in Pakistan. Now let me turn away from the regional updates and give some insights into how we're driving growth in our network using our digital solutions. Let me start with Visa Direct, which is one of the key ways we're capturing new incremental payment flows. Global growth continues to be over 100% this quarter, fueled by increased activities by end users as well as continued expansion of our reach and our scale. Our 2 billion-plus Visa debit credentials globally enabled us to execute Visa Direct transactions in more than 150 countries this fiscal year. But it's also important to note that the speed of funds within our total reach is very important, with payment originators automatically leveraged when issuers move their credentials to Fast Funds. We are quickly increasing the number of issuers moving to real-time, adding Spain and Ireland this quarter, for a total of over 70 countries where Fast Funds are enabled. In the UK, Barclays moved to Fast Funds, allowing participating Barclays cardholders in Visa Direct programs access to money real time. In our goal to expand our reach, we will continue to look for opportunities to access accounts not directly linked to a Visa credential. To that end, our most recent expansion is with our Plus interbank ATM network, which is leveraged by many non-Visa bank issued ATM cards. TD Bank Canada was the first bank to enable its Plus debit credentials to receive Visa Direct deposits on non-Visa credentials. This is a great first step. As other Canadian issuers enable this expanded reach, we can serve most of the Canadian bank population of consumers and small businesses. We are then building upon Visa Direct's unique reach by rapidly scaling solutions through use case expansion and large platform enablement. We continue to deepen our penetration of existing verticals, including property and casualty insurance, where our clients enhance their customers' experiences. This category represents $330 billion in claims payments, approximately 45% of which are paid by check today in the United States. This past quarter we signed new partnerships with a couple of insurance companies to enable more real-time disbursements to their customers. There are also many use cases that support the gig economy. For example, we partnered with PayActiv, one of the largest gig economy earned wage access providers, to incorporate Visa Direct as a real-time payroll option. Given the growth in the number of workers participating in the gig economy, we believe this is a big opportunity, since many employees in the gig economy want access to their wages as they are earned. Visa Direct's distribution model also scales quickly in partnership with platform providers around the world. As you probably know, Visa Direct is powering many of the P2P solutions globally. And another new example is Samsung's recent launch of P2P payments in partnership with VTB Bank in Russia, providing a seamless customer experience for making payments as well as sending and receiving money. Another example of platform partners is in India, with Paytm and PhonePe, both leading mobile payment apps, who have activated credit card bill payments on the Visa Direct platform, enabling over 100 million mobile app customers. We recently announced the commercial expansion of the Visa Token Service for 20 credential-on-file token requesters, which we believe is a significant step in further securing customer payments in the digital channel. These leading acquirer gateway and technology partners include Adyen, Braintree, PayPal, CyberSource, Elavon, Square, Stripe, and Worldpay, just to name a few. And they will tokenize credential-on-file digital payments on behalf of their merchant and payment clients. In addition to reducing fraud risk by not exposing cardholders' more sensitive account information, we're focused on improving card-not-present authorization rates that, frankly, continue to be too low. Visa tokens also allow issuers around the world to push dynamic updates on lost, stolen, or expired credentials to enable a frictionless merchant and customer experience. So Visa now has over 60 global token requesters across 40 markets on our token platform. Last week, a significant milestone was reached for secure remote commerce after EMVco published a draft of the technical specifications. This now enables the ecosystem to begin building to the standard while also allowing merchants and issuers a feedback period before the final specifications are published in about two months' time. The specifications for branding and the user experience are still expected to be published in early 2019. We again are working closely with partners such as Adyen, Braintree, CyberSource, Stripe, and Worldpay to activate the ecosystem for the initial launch of secure remote commerce in mid to late 2019. Now a few quick updates on the adoption of our acceptance technologies, including contactless and scan-to-pay. Let me start with contactless or tap-and-pay adoption, which continues to grow rapidly, as it is a better consumer and merchant experience than paying with a dip, swipe, or scan. One in four domestic face-to-face transactions that run over our network globally are now contactless. If you exclude the United States, domestic contactless penetration is over 40%, which is up over 12 percentage points in the last year and up almost 4 points versus the last quarter. More than 20 countries have increased their domestic contactless penetration by more than 20 points since last year, led by Russia, which is up 38 points to over 50%. During the FIFA World Cup, contactless payments accounted for 45% of all Visa purchases across the 11 host cities in Russia. The U.S. market is poised for significant contactless growth over the coming year. There are a few facts to note. Number one, on the acceptance side, in the past three months several of the largest merchants have enabled contactless in their stores, including 7-Eleven, CVS Pharmacy stores, and Costco. Over 70 of the top 100 merchants by transactions now accept contactless, an increase of more than 20 in the past year. Additionally, over half of all face-to-face transactions now occur at a contactless-enabled merchant, up from over a little bit around one-third of all merchants a year ago. On the issuing side, several of our largest clients will begin issuing contactless cards over the next few quarters. We expect that there will be over 100 million Visa contactless cards issued in the United States by the end of 2019. Costco is a good example of the potential impact when both the issuing and acceptance come together, since the Citi-Costco co-brand card is contactless-enabled. Over half of in-store payments at Costco on their co-brand card are now paid with a tap after Costco enabled contactless payments just in mid-August of this year. Establishing scan-to-pay acceptance and cardholder usage is progressing very well. As we discussed in prior quarters, India is our largest market, where we now have over 700,000 scan-to-pay acceptance points. But we're also seeing momentum in a number of markets in the CEMEA region. In Tanzania, this quarter we signed a deal with Halotel, a leading mobile network operator, to put Visa credentials into their mobile phone wallets. We also launched scan-to-pay in Pakistan with HBL, the country's largest issuer and acquirer, with 50,000 consumers being enabled in the first few days. And they have plans to make the solution available to almost 1 million customers and thousands of merchants in the coming months. In Kazakhstan, we partnered with a leading mobile network operator to introduce cashless ticketing in 3,000 public transport buses across four cities. Lastly, we continue to expand into new segments, and B2B is our top priority. Specifically, we continue to innovate and grow our B2B payment offerings across both core card solutions and expanding to new payment flows. In terms of core card solutions, we remain the global leader, but there still is tremendous opportunity for growth. Our B2B payments volume was $950 billion, or over 11% of our total payments volume this fiscal year, and the growth has been accelerating into the mid-teens in the past two quarters. Let me also share three examples of new payment flow opportunities we're capitalizing on in the B2B space. One, we continue to expand our virtual card business, including a partnership with Nexus to enable their clients, who are typically real estate property managers, to pay suppliers more quickly, safely, and conveniently by using Visa virtual cards. In Russia, we signed a new partnership agreement with Sberbank to support their growth in the small business and enterprise segments and maintain their leadership position in B2B in Russia. This is an example of partners seeing the value in differentiating to small businesses rather than just offering them a consumer card option. We continue to enhance and scale our B2B Connect solution. In addition to Visa virtual card being a payment option that are offered to Bottom Line's clients, we've extended our partnership with Bottom Line to enable B2B Connect as a payment option for large-ticket cross-border payables. We're also launching a digital identity solution that tokenizes an organization's sensitive business information, such as bank account numbers, giving them a unique identifier that could be utilized for their B2B Connect transactions. There were two other notable events in the quarter. The first, we reached a settlement with the damages class on the U.S. MDL lawsuit in September and have submitted it to the court for preliminary approval, which we expect to take a few months. There will be a period for merchants to opt out or object. But assuming the court assesses the settlement to be fair and reasonable, we expect formal approval to take at least a year to be in place. This settlement does not resolve the injunctive relief class claims seeking modifications to network rules. We are certainly pleased to be making progress, but it's hard to say when the MDL litigation will actually conclude. For more than 30 years, Visa has been a proud sponsor of the Olympic Games, and this quarter we renewed our partnership through the 2032 games, which includes the upcoming venues of Tokyo, Beijing, Paris, and Los Angeles. The Olympic Games provides an unparalleled opportunity to promote the Visa brand at a regional and global level while also facilitating partnerships and joint business initiatives with clients that come to life through cobranding and/or client usage of Olympic IP. The world's largest sporting event also provides a unique platform for showcasing product innovation and launching new business initiatives. So fiscal 2018 was a great year where we delivered strong business driver and financial performance while also advancing key initiatives that will drive future growth such as Visa Direct, B2B, contactless, and digital solutions. We also successfully concluded the major aspects of the Visa Europe integration with the completion of the platform migration and the shift to commercial client contracts. However, fiscal 2018 is behind us now, and we are totally focused on 2019. Our financial outlook for fiscal 2019 includes annual net revenue growth of low double digits on a nominal basis, with approximately 1 percentage point of negative foreign currency impact, and a de minimis impact from the new revenue accounting standard. And we look for mid-teens earnings per share growth on a non-GAAP nominal dollar basis, also including approximately 1 percentage point of negative foreign currency impact. To share more of our details on our results and more on our 2019 outlook, I'll now turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. Good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong finish to fiscal year 2018. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter net revenues were up 12%, and EPS was up 37%. Adjusted to exclude a special item, EPS grew 34%, which includes a 10 percentage point benefit from the impact of U.S. tax reform. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year were a drag on net revenue growth of almost 50 basis points and EPS growth of approximately 1 percentage point. Full-year net revenues of $20.6 billion were up 12%. Net income on a GAAP basis was $10.3 billion, and EPS was $4.42. On an adjusted basis, net income for the full year was $10.7 billion, up 29%, and EPS was $4.61, up 32%. The adjustments for each quarter are described in our earnings release. On a full-year basis, U.S. tax reform contributed 10 percentage points to net income and EPS growth. For the full year, exchange rate shifts added 1 percentage point to net revenue growth and 1.5 percentage points to EPS growth. A few other points to note, in the fourth quarter, we donated available-for-sale investment securities to the Visa Foundation. Our adjusted results exclude this special item, which is $195 million of non-cash G&A expense as well as the realized gain in non-operating income/expense and the tax benefit associated with the charitable contribution. Growth remained steady across business drivers, with little change relative to the third quarter. On a constant dollar basis, payments volume grew 11% and processed transactions grew 12%. Cross-border volume grew 10%. As a reminder, Q3 cross-border volume growth of 10% was reduced by 1 percentage point due to lapping a settlement delay in Europe last year. As the dollar strengthened, cross-border growth decelerated through the fourth quarter in some corridors, particularly commerce inbound to the U.S. As the dollar rose, the currency translation impact on net revenue growth swung from the 150 basis point tailwind we enjoyed in the third quarter to an almost 50 basis point headwind in the fourth quarter, contributing a 200 basis point slowdown in reported net revenue growth trend. In addition to a strong dollar, this significant shift was driven by a sharp weakening in many emerging market currencies, in particular the Argentinian peso, the Turkish lira, and the Brazilian real. For the full year, exchange rates increased net revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points. However, based on current exchange rates and the forward curve, the currency translation impact is expected to be a 100 basis point headwind in fiscal year 2019. At the end of the second full year of our ownership of Visa Europe, results are tracking well ahead of our acquisition model. Cumulative EPS accretion is over 10% two years ahead of expectations. We have also completed the two most significant and complex aspects of the integration, the technology platform migration and the restructuring of major client contracts to competitive commercial terms. In Q4, we repurchased 11.5 million shares of Visa stock for $1.6 billion, at an average price of $142.84. For the full year we repurchased a total of 57.5 million shares for $7.2 billion, at an average price of $124.25. In addition, in June 2018 we funded the litigation escrow account with an additional $600 million. As a reminder, funding of the escrow triggers a conversion rate adjustment of Class B common stock to shares of Class A common stock, which has the same effect on EPS as repurchasing $600 million of Class A common stock. In fiscal year 2018, we paid $1.9 billion in dividends. Our board has authorized an increase of 19% in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share per quarter. Moving on to the quarter's business drivers and our financial results, I'll keep my comments on fiscal year 2018 brief and spend most of my time on our outlook for fiscal year 2019. Payments volume momentum continued, with 11% growth in the third quarter for the third quarter in a row. U.S. payment volumes grew 12%, fueled by 12% debit growth. Debit growth was driven by Visa Direct as well as robust consumer spending across most retail categories. International payment volumes in constant dollars grew 11%, with 1 point of deceleration primarily due to the runoff of dual-brand portfolios in China. In addition, acceleration in India and southern Europe was offset by slower growth in the UK and Australia. Global cross-border volumes grew 10% on a constant dollar basis. Inbound commerce to the U.S. slowed with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, falling to mid-single digits after two quarters of double-digit growth. Cross-border commerce growth in Europe remained strong and stable. Outbound commerce from the U.S. accelerated, while growth in outbound commerce from Canada, Latin America, and China slowed. Transactions processed through VisaNet grew 12%, in line with the prior three quarters. Through October 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 11%, with U.S. credit growing 11% and debit 12%. Cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis was up 11%, and processed transactions grew 12%. Net revenues in the fourth quarter grew 12%. Data processing revenue benefited from the pricing which went into effect in the third quarter, growing 16%. International revenue grew 10%, with benefits from Q3 pricing actions offset by the impact of shifting exchange rates and lower currency volatility. Service revenues grew 10%. As a reminder, service revenues are recognized with a one quarter lag and reflect third quarter exchange rates. Other revenues grew 13%. Client incentives stepped up from 20.8% of gross revenue in the third quarter to 21.7%, as we signed several large deals. However, client incentives were lower than we had anticipated due to some contract signing delays. This delay was due to complex deals where the terms were agreed but multiple contracts needed to be finalized and signed in order to recognize the incentives. As a reminder, Q4 last year was a very active quarter of contract renewals in Europe, China, and Russia. As a result, year-over-year growth in client incentives is lower this quarter than in prior quarters of fiscal year 2018. Moving to expenses, GAAP operating expenses were up 23%. Adjusted to exclude the special item previously noted, operating expenses in the fourth quarter grew 12%, largely driven by personnel costs. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, personnel increases were driven by higher head count dedicated to our investment initiatives as well as higher incentive compensation resulting from our operating performance in fiscal year 2018. Also, as you know, we increased our contribution to employee 401(k) plans in the U.S. and acquired Fraedom earlier this year. In addition, we recorded a severance charge in the fourth quarter for adjustments we are making in various parts of our global organization structure. Expense growth in other categories was higher than our prior outlook, as we made additional marketing investments, primarily around the very successful FIFA World Cup finals in Russia and also had several non-recurring items in the quarter, including a litigation settlement. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 19.6% on a GAAP basis and 21% adjusted to exclude the tax benefit associated with our contribution to the Visa Foundation. Adjusted EPS was $1.21, up 34%. Exchange rate shifts reduced reported Q4 EPS growth by almost 1 percentage point. For the full year of fiscal 2018, net revenues were $20.6 billion, up 12%, including approximately 1 percentage point positive currency impact. Full-year adjusted EPS was $4.61, up 32%, with a currency tailwind of approximately 1.5 percentage points. As mentioned, U.S. tax reform contributed 10 percentage points to EPS growth. With that, I'll move to our outlook for fiscal 2019. Overall, our net revenue outlook for fiscal year 2019 assumes current trends and key business drivers remain largely intact through the year, with the currency translation impact shifting from a tailwind to a headwind. Double-digits payment volume growth is assumed to continue in most parts of the world. In North America, growth rates are expected to slow down in the second half as we lap strong debit growth in fiscal year 2018 as well as the higher gas prices. International payments volume growth is forecast to stay strong and stable. Share gains in several markets are offset by slowing dual-brand issuance in China. As always, cross-border growth is harder to forecast as we look four quarters out. Exchange rates, geopolitical factors, and macroeconomic shifts will drive variability. Assuming current exchange rate expectations and no significant changes on other fronts, our outlook forecasts a continuation of double-digit growth rates. There is an expectation that the dollar will weaken in the second half, driving an improvement in cross-border commerce inbound to the U.S. Pricing actions which become effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 will also help drive second half international revenue growth rates higher than the first half. Processed transaction growth remained stable and healthy throughout fiscal 2018. Our outlook assumes that steady growth will continue through fiscal year 2019. Data processing revenue growth rates are expected to be higher during the first half due to the pricing actions in fiscal year 2018, with a dip in Q3 as we lap these actions. On the client incentive front, we ended the year with incentives in the fourth quarter as a percent of gross revenues at 21.7%. Our outlook for fiscal 2019 is a range of 22% to 23%. The step up in incentives as a percent of gross revenue is driven by the full-year impact of renewals and new deals signed in fiscal 2018 as well as renewals and new deals that we anticipate signing in fiscal year 2019. Globally, we have a large number of renewals. As Al indicated, around 20% of our global payments volume is slated for this coming fiscal year. Based on our current expectation for the timing of client renewals, incentive growth rates are expected to be higher in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2019 and lower than the full-year growth trend in the first and fourth quarters. We will, of course, provide updates as the year progresses. As you know, we make our best estimates for the terms and timing of renewals for the upcoming year, but client-specific considerations will determine actual outcomes. In terms of the currency translation impact, based on current rates and forward expectations, we project a 100 basis point net revenue headwind for fiscal 2019. This drag will be greater in the second and third quarters as we lap the tailwinds we enjoyed in fiscal year 2018. And if forward curves are to be believed, the drag will be the lowest in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. When you put all this together, our outlook is for low double-digit nominal net revenue growth in fiscal year 2019. We currently anticipate the impact of the new accounting standard on net revenue to be de minimis. If you incorporate what I just walked through, it becomes evident that the cadence of net revenue growth is not steady through the year. The highest growth for the year is likely in the fourth quarter and the lowest growth rate in the second quarter. In the second quarter, net revenue growth could be in the high single digits, impacted by higher incentive growth, a larger exchange rate drag, as well as lapping higher currency volatility in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The fourth quarter benefits from fiscal year 2019 pricing actions as well as a lower drag from both incentives and exchange rates. On the expense front, we continue to invest in our business, partially funding these investments by shifting resources from lower priority areas and from savings we derive from better purchasing as well as other efficiency programs. In aggregate, fiscal year 2019 operating expense growth adjusted for special items in fiscal year 2018 is projected to be in the mid to high single-digit range. This includes approximately 1.5 to 2 percentage points of additional reported expenses from adopting the new accounting standard. Expense growth cadence through the year will also fluctuate. Adjusted expense growth will be in the double digits in the first quarter, in line with recent trends, and then step down to mid-single digits for the remainder of the year. In fiscal year 2018, expenses were lower in the first quarter for several reasons. Personnel expenses ramped up through the year, as we added resources to drive our investment initiatives. Incentive compensation accruals also stepped up through the year, in line with our operating performance. Also, the additional 401(k) contribution and Fraedom expenses started in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We had higher marketing expenses in the second to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the Winter Olympics and the FIFA World Cup finals. In fiscal year 2019, marketing expenses are expected to be higher in the first quarter. Network and processing growth rates were elevated during the second half of fiscal year 2018, as we ran parallel Europe technology systems. This will continue into the first half of fiscal 2019 and will be lower in the second half as we complete the shutdown of the legacy Visa Europe platform. Based on all of these factors, the adjusted expense growth rate is expected to be highest in the first quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Some color on how the adoption of the new accounting standard, ASC 606, will impact our reported fiscal year 2019 P&L. Based on our assessment of existing contracts through September 30, 2018, we will re-amortize some upfront payments that we expensed in prior years. This increases client incentives and reduces reported net revenues. Offsetting this reduction is an increase to gross revenues related to certain programs like market development funds, almost all on the other revenues line. Operating expenses related to market development funds will increase by the same amount, almost all on the marketing expense line, with no net impact on operating earnings. Other effects that we have estimated are the amortization of upfront payments we might make for fiscal year 2019 renewals and new deals, which would have been expensed immediately under the old rules, which reduces client incentives. Finally, there are some client marketing expenses that will be recorded in the incentives line and no longer in marketing expenses. Our best estimate of the net of all this is a de minimis impact on net revenues, higher other revenues offset by higher client incentives, and a 1.5 to 2 point increase in operating expenses, almost all on the marketing expense line. As we have said many times before, this has no impact on the cash flow or economic value of our business. As required, we will report each quarter what the impact of ASC 606 was on our income statement. Our adjusted tax rate for 2018 was 20%. This includes three quarters of impact of a lower statutory tax rate as a result of U.S. tax reform. Our FY 2018 tax rate also benefited from an audit settlement and the successful resolution of several state tax initiatives we have been working on for many years. Resolution of these items resulted in recording some benefits related to prior years, which will not recur. These non-recurring benefits lowered our tax rate in fiscal 2018 by 1.5 to 2 points. In fiscal year 2019, we will have a full year of lower U.S. corporate tax rate. We're awaiting final guidance from the Department of Treasury for the new provisions that go into effect in 2019, also known as the GILTI and FDII rules. In fiscal year 2019, our tax rate will be lower by 1.5 to 2 points from a full year of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate and our best estimate for the impact of the new provisions. This will offset the loss of non-recurring benefits that were included in our fiscal year 2018 results. Hence, our outlook projects a fiscal year 2019 tax rate in the 20% to 20.5% range. Putting all these components together, our outlook is for nominal EPS growth in the mid-teens on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis. This includes approximately 1 point of negative foreign currency translation impact. With net revenue and operating expense growth rates fluctuating from quarter to quarter, EPS growth rates will too. EPS growth rate based on a combination of these assumptions will be in the low teens range in the second and third quarters and well above the mid-teens levels in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, our outlook is for nominal net revenue growth in the low double digits, double-digit operating expense growth in line with recent trends, and mid-teens adjusted EPS growth. As always, there are risks to monitor: exchange rate shifts of course; the possibility of a hard Brexit; economic dislocations like we had in Argentina and Turkey; geopolitical changes like trade wars, et cetera. As we normally do, we will update our outlook when we talk to you each quarter. Moving on to capital, cash flow, dividends, and buybacks, capital spending in fiscal 2019 is likely to be around $800 million. This includes capital associated with hardware, support growth, resiliency and cybersecurity, an upgrade of our data center in the UK, investments in other facilities, as well as capitalization of software from our technology development projects. Based on our earnings outlook and capital spending plans, free cash flow from operations is anticipated to be in excess of $13 billion. Most of this free cash flow will be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. In fiscal 2019, we anticipate returning at least $11 billion to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks. The Visa board has authorized a 19% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, in line with our dividend policy. This puts our payout ratio in the 20% to 25% range. In fiscal 2018, we completed additional buybacks to neutralize the impacts from stock issued to Visa Europe owners as part of the acquisition. In fiscal year 2019, we anticipate buying back at least $8.5 billion of Visa stock. As a reminder, we will hit the three-year anniversary of the Visa Europe acquisition in June 2019. In June we will be making a cash payment of a little over \u20ac1.1 billion to the former owners of Visa Europe, as per the terms of our acquisition agreement. We should also point out that as interest rates have risen, we are earning more investment income from our cash balances, which offsets some of our interest expense. Both interest income and expense are recorded in non-operating income/expense. In summary, as Al described with facts and figures, the Visa system continues to expand and thrive in a fast-changing payments landscape. As evidenced by our growth in fiscal year 2018, the opportunity to digitize cash in new and different ways has never been better. With a tailwind of strong global economies and robust consumer spending enhanced by the growth strategies that Al outlined, we look forward once again to delivering on the revenue and earnings growth you have come to expect from us. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Okay. We're willing to run 10 minutes long, so we have more time for questions. So with that, we're ready to get started with questions.\nOperator: Thank you Our first question today comes from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Hi, thanks for taking the time today, two questions. First, what gives you confidence that the U.S. dollar will start to retreat in the back half of the year next year to put that in the guidance? And secondly, can you talk about yields on Visa Direct and push payments, as we hear a lot of Fast growth in that area going on globally from all networks? Thank you.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.: Craig, it's Al. I'll take the second question and I'll let Vasant take the first. We initially guided to Visa Direct heavily in the P2P space, where frankly, there's not a lot of economics. Our yields there tend to be less than we would get on normal Visa transactions. But as we move into some of these new use cases, we aren't expected to get yields that are similar to what we get in the typical pull transactions that we do today. Let me ask Vasant to talk about what our view is on the retreating U.S. dollar in back end of the year.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: I don't think our crystal ball is any better than anybody else's, and so we don't really try to predict those things. We just look at forward curves and make some assumptions based on that. But the thing that happens, if in fact the dollar begins to weaken, let's say, in the second half, it will help us in certain corridors and it will hurt us in other corridors, and there's a net effect of that. So even if it doesn't happen as might be projected by forward curves, there are normal balancing effects in the business. So it's not a one-way bet in a sense. So if the dollar weakens, clearly we benefit from a translation standpoint. We have given you our best guess of about 100 basis points of impact in net revenue. On the cross-border side, we would benefit with the inbound corridor to the U.S. But on the other hand, we will benefit in other parts of the world from the dollar weakening. So there's a lot of offsetting factors.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks a lot. You covered a lot of ground in the prepared remarks, it's useful. I wanted to ask on the revenue outlook. You're calling for low double-digit for fiscal 2019. At this time last year, you guided to high single-digit growth, I believe, and you landed at 12%. So I'm curious why you're more optimistic this year versus last year. Is your visibility perhaps a little bit better? Is there a different level of conservatism maybe that you're baking in? Just curious to compare where you stand this year on your outlook versus this time last year. Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Sure, Tien-Tsin. As we normally do, we give you our best sense of the upcoming year based on the facts we have available at this point in time. And if you looked at where we were at the end of last year, clearly the strength of the U.S. consumer in particular ended up being stronger than we expected. As you saw, our debit growth was mid-single digits for quite a few quarters leading up to the year. And then starting in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, we jumped into the double digits and have stayed there. So there were various elements of the business that clearly changed their growth trajectory after we gave you the outlook for the year. So you could say that things happened that were stronger than we expected. The global economy was stronger than we expected. In the second quarter and the third quarter in particular, the exchange rate tailwinds were stronger than we might have expected when we went into the year. So these things happen, and we update you as we learn them. As we look ahead, again, we're doing the same thing. We're giving you the best sense we have of the business as we enter the year. And therefore, we give you as much color as we did as to what our assumptions are. Obviously, we'll update you as the year progresses. I know some people try to read into what we say, things like oh, they're being conservative. They want to leave room to raise it in the future and all that. And as we've told you all along, we give you our best sense at any point in time. We are not trying to be overly conservative or otherwise, and this is our best sense as we stand today.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nDonald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Al, so it's pretty interesting to see double-digit revenue growth coming again this year for a company with a $300 billion market cap. As you look out over the intermediate term and you think about revenue growth, the model, do you still see the same secular contribution coming through as payments move away from cash? Because sometimes it's hard for us to see when we might at a tipping point given a lot of new technologies and payment initiatives coming in.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.: Don, as you might guess, I'm not going to give a long-term forecast on revenue. We just explained how we got to the number for just this year and the assumptions in that. That said, I'm quite confident in the business over a long period of time, and we've got lots of different vectors on which I think we can continue to grow this business, whether it's by penetrating new payment flows, penetrating new segments, penetrating new geographies, bringing more of the unbanked around the world into the mainstream financial system. I think some of these capabilities that we are developing in terms of things like Visa Direct, some of the technologies that I think are enabling a better user experience at the actual moment when a user uses a card, whether that's contactless or QR, and hopefully, in 2019, the big change in e-commerce as we move to secure remote commerce. So I think that there are just a good number of growth vectors for this business that give me a good deal of confidence in our ability to continue to grow our volumes. And as we grow our volumes, obviously revenues should come along. And so I remain confident about the future of Visa in terms of the volumes we can deliver.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: And just adding to that, we've historically talked a lot about you might call our traditional payment flows, which is the B2C \u2013 B2B business \u2013 I'm sorry, the consumer-to-merchant business, C2B. And as you know, we believe there's a lot of opportunity there to continue to digitize cash and increase PC penetration. But increasingly, as Al said, it's these new payment flows as we call them that are enabled by things like Visa Direct, which would be P2P, and disbursements, which is a B2C, that we're getting increasingly excited about. And then of course, Visa Direct also enables many elements of B2B and G2C, government-to-consumer. And then B2B remains a huge opportunity. We are already close to $1 trillion in payment volume there, and we would like to see it grow much faster than let's call it our core consumer to \u2013 C2B business.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat. Your line is now open.\nHarshita Rawat - AllianceBernstein L.P.: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask about emerging markets. There appears to be a lot happening underground in some of these markets that government involvement needs domestic schemes in certain instances, almost a new Fast ACH and API infrastructure. So my question for you is how should we think about your ability to quickly adapt in these very rapidly evolving markets? And is there anything you need to do on the pricing partnerships on the technology front?\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.: Harshita, many of these emerging markets which are \u2013 where there's clearly lots of dynamics, as you talked about, Visa has been on the ground in these markets for in many cases multiple decades, and we've got experienced teams in those markets. And I think if I put China aside, where we actually still don't have a domestic license, but we look at some of the countries in Asia, some of the countries in South America, some of the countries in Africa, we I think have had a market leadership position, and we I think will continue to look to forge both good partnerships with people where it makes sense. The reality is the payments ecosystem is hugely about partnerships already. And I think as I look forward, there will be even more partnerships as some of the FinTechs really take hold and provide various value-added services. We are committed to VisaNet. We think it is the best network in the world in addition to being the biggest in the world. We continue to invest in it in big ways and will continue to invest in it. That said, we are very pragmatic people. And to the degree that there are other rails that Visa transactions might \u2013 or Visa credentials might be used on where we can do something in partnership, where perhaps there are various value-added services we might be able to still provide, even if a transaction isn't running on our rails, we'll be committed to do that. So I think that we are going down multiple paths where we're both trying to continue to strengthen the assets we have today, starting with our network, but also the investment in lots of capabilities we're doing. But we're also going to be smart about partnering where partnering makes sense. We're committed to try to be in the middle of as many payment flows as possible. And if we can control \u2013 if we can have the full control of that payment flow, great. If in some cases we're participating in it as a partial player, that's also fine as well. So I think that we are well-positioned. If you look at India as one case study, that's a market we've been in for 35 years. We've got a big team on the ground there. And we continue to be the market leader even though there's lots of activity going on there in terms of both government intervention, as you talk about, as well as new players that are emerging.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, thanks, guys. Look, I know there are some pricing initiatives at the company, and you touched on the anniversary of some in 2019. But maybe you could just help us understand from a cadence standpoint what kind of benefit we could have through the year. And then, Al, just higher level, between Europe and other areas, do you see similar pricing opportunities in 2019 and 2020 that you saw in 2018? Especially on the back of Europe front-end integration being done now, do you have some room there? Thanks.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.: So, Darrin, I'd say two things. One is both Vasant and I have been clear about what we see in terms of pricing in Europe. The second thing I'd say is that we have had a longstanding policy of not getting involved, for many reasons, including competitive reasons, in forecasting specific pricing actions that we would take and where we would take them geographically and in terms of on the network. And I think we're going to revert back to not commenting on specific pricing plans on a going-forward basis. But obviously, that said, we recognize that it's an important lever.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: And our plans for 2019 include pricing. There's carryover pricing from 2018 that flows into the first half of 2019. And as I said in the comments earlier, we have some pricing coming in, in 2019. And so order of magnitude, across the whole business, there's about similar kinds of pricing between the two years.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Lisa?\nLisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC: Sorry, good afternoon, guys. My question is about Visa Direct. I like to see the strong metrics there year on year. Can you give an idea of \u2013 so you highlighted use cases associated with P2P disbursements, some B2B use cases. Can you give a sense for is there a pathway and what does it look like to using Visa Direct for things like bill pay or even more traditional merchant transactions, particularly in geographies where there is incumbent Fast ACH networks, where that type of push payment is already heavily in use for those types of transactions? Is that a focus area, and can you give a sense for what that timeline or that pathway looks like?\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.: So we already do, Lisa, have some bill pay use cases that are happening in different geographies around the world. And again, our view is that by reversing the typical way that our network works that we have lots of opportunity in lots of different use cases. And we've got a dedicated team that's spending a lot of time thinking about bill pay, P2P, disbursements, and faster payments to merchants. I think those are the four primary businesses that at the moment that we can see ourselves playing in in terms of Visa Direct. And specifically on bill pay, I know both in Singapore and in India we have use cases going on right now.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJames E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a point of clarification first on \u2013 I think, Vasant, you mentioned that there's 20% of your total volume that's up for renewal in 2018. You touched on its impact on incentives, but as a dull roar (1:02:12), how does that compare to previous years? Or at least what has been in the last few years by comparison, just to contextualize it a little bit? And then, Al, I wanted to follow up on the questions related to \u2013 on new technologies and partnerships. When you look at some of the things that you've rolled out like the recent announcement of B2B Connect, et cetera, how close are you working with your partners to visualize and then push the boundaries on new initiatives? And I'm wondering how much is like being pulled from your partners as they look for opportunities. I'm just trying to get a sense as to how receptive the market may be to some of these new initiatives. Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: I'll take the first one, and Al I think is going to answer the second one. In terms of the renewal tempo, FY 2017, fiscal year 2017 and 2018 was heavy in Europe. As Al was even saying, we opened up 100 contracts, more than 100 contracts and redid them, and you saw that in some of the client incentive movements. 2016, 2017, and 2018 in the rest of the world were somewhat lower than the 20% pace. So 20% inclusive of Europe is probably more of \u2013 a little higher than the last couple of years on a global basis, but 2015 was a bigger year from a renewal standpoint. So that gives you some flavor for it. Our average contracts run from three to seven years typically, so about five years is a decent estimate. The 20% is getting more to par for the course.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.: James, on the second question related to new technologies, first of all, I'd say that we try to be very client and consumer/business owner-centric in all we do. We don't just try to come up with capabilities and technologies for the sake of having them. We want and are only interested in creating capabilities and products that we think solve a particular problem or fill a particular need in the payment ecosystem. That said, there are cases where we are sometimes being pushed by our clients to move faster, and there are cases where we're pushing or pulling our clients along, asking them to come along more quickly. And by the way, for the same capability or the same product, we can have each of those cases at different clients. So we could have some clients who we have to pull along and some who are pushing for us to move faster. So constant communication and an open stream of dialogue is critical in these cases. And we try to sit with clients, particularly our biggest clients, and give them a sense of what's in our product pipeline, what are we thinking about over the next year or two, so that they have some transparency into what we're thinking. Because often we need them to come along, because often one of the things that is on the critical path of progress is them opening up their tech queues and making sure that they're doing whatever changes they need to make to accommodate some capability or product that we're putting into the marketplace.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks, a quick question on the China dual-card spending volumes. I was under the impression that the conversion to two cards had stopped. Is that not the case anymore because you guys mentioned that weakness? And then secondly, on these tokenization partnerships, I guess when we think about what the longer-term or even intermediate-term benefits are, are there specific pilots that you will launch around those partnerships or any economic benefits?\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.: On the first question, Sanjay, there are definitely a good number of our Chinese bank partners. I don't know how many. We have 55, I think 56 China bank issuer partners, and a good number of them are still issuing dual-badged cards. So yes, that's still happening. On the tokenization partnerships, look, this is something we're very committed to. We have always taken a lead in trying to make sure the payment ecosystem is as secure as it possibly can be. And getting to a point where payment credentials are codified in a different way using tokens versus the actual card number we believe is critical for the infrastructure. My personal belief, by getting these large token requesters on board now and getting to the point where we have 60 very strong token requesters in 40 markets around the world is going to start triggering some key merchants to start moving to tokenizing their card-on-file pans from today. And I think like everything in life that this is one of those things that if we can build some momentum, which I think we can, that it will really start to take off. But clearly, like everything, again, you need some tipping point where the momentum really starts to take off and you move from pushing an initiative uphill to watching it roll downhill. And I think in the case of tokenization, we're probably still trying to push it uphill a little bit, but I feel like we're close to the top of the hill, and we'll start seeing it roll down the hill as key merchants get enabled by these token requesters that we've recently signed.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Okay, last question, Katie.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMoshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great, thanks. Most of my questions actually have been asked and answered. But, Al, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit on the last point. What are the types of transactions that you wouldn't see running over the network today because of not having the tokenization partnership, and how would you see that developing over the next year or two?\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.: I think they're two unrelated things. Look, as big and as broad and as large as our network is, we are not connected to every single bank account around the world. And so I think that there could be cases, certainly as it relates to the movement in certain markets towards real-time payments, where we're doing something in partnership with another set of rails. I think as we do that, one of the things we will bring to the party, among many capabilities that we uniquely have on our network, will be tokens. But there will be other capabilities that we bring along as well, including the fact that we're global, including the fact that we have rules that handle things like disputes and chargebacks, including the fact that we've got a great array of risk and fraud tools that we can bring to the party. So that's how I think about it, Moshe.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: We'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again and have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Mike, thank you and good afternoon to everybody and thanks for joining us today. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. Revenue growth was 15% as all of our key economic drivers remained strong. The healthy global economic fundamentals we've seen in the past few quarters have largely continued. Payments volume growth on a constant dollar basis of 11% accelerated modestly versus the prior quarter fueled by faster growth in almost every region and higher credit growth. Cross-border growth on a constant dollar basis of 10% decelerated by 1 percentage point versus the prior quarter largely due to the stronger dollar. Processed transaction growth was consistent with the last quarter at 12%. Expense growth adjusted for the U.S. litigation provision increase was 14% as we continue to invest in talent and deploying new capabilities in markets around the world. Adjusted EPS growth was 39%. We also returned approximately $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter consisting of almost $1.8 billion of share repurchases and nearly $500 million through dividends. Vasant will take you through our results and our full-year outlook in more detail when I complete my remarks. Regarding the U.S. interchange multidistrict litigation or the MDL provision increase of $600 million this quarter, we continue to make progress in resolving this litigation and have reached an agreement in principle with the class seeking monetary damages. That agreement is subject to negotiation of a full written agreement and those negotiations are ongoing. Discussions with the class seeking injunctive relief are also ongoing. We will make an announcement related to any agreement if and when any settlement agreement is finalized. Now let me share updates from around the world starting with Europe. We continue to be very pleased with our performance in Europe and feel there is substantial runway for growth moving forward as the integration nears completion. We see significant opportunity over time across three broad tracks: the acceleration of payments volume growth, country-specific opportunities and increasing yield. First, we can accelerate our volume growth by displacing cash in key markets and increasing our share of domestic transactions. Cash still accounts for a sizable share of consumer spend in several of Europe's largest economies, such as approximately 60% in Spain, Italy, and Poland. Nine markets in Europe have an active or a large domestic card scheme, where we feel we have competitive advantages based on our innovative investments and digital capabilities. We're also enabling Fast Funds for Visa Direct driving contactless payments and working more closely with FinTechs on new and innovative offerings. This quarter we announced the FinTech fast-track access program to accelerate speed-to-market by onboarding FinTechs with Visa in four weeks. We also launched $100 million European investment program to support the FinTech ecosystem, building upon investments we've already made in companies like Klarna and solarisBank. Second, there are opportunities to gain share on specific markets within Europe as our current business is relatively concentrated. We plan to target faster growing markets and markets where we have lower share with investments in talent to support clients' innovative product solutions and enhanced marketing. Finally, there's opportunity to increase yields in Europe. First, we are focusing more on higher yielding consumer and commercial credit volumes. Prior to our acquisition, Visa Europe as an association was very debit-centric and did not focus much on credit; second, driving client adoption of value-added solutions, leveraging our global VisaNet platform capabilities, particularly our risk products, processing and services relevant in a PSD2 environment. Thirdly, we continue to see pricing opportunities in Europe. As we get closer to the end of the Europe technical integration work and the transition of our existing clients to incentive contracts, we are shifting our focus to these growth opportunities. I will talk more about the technical migration in a moment, but I'd be remiss not to mention the partial disruption of our European processing experience on June 1. We, at Visa, hold ourselves to very high standards, so any impact on our processing for any period of time is unacceptable and we take it very seriously. That said, let me clarify a few points. It was not an outage, and in fact, approximately 95% of unique transactions attempted over the 10-hour period were completed successfully. The partial service disruption was on Visa Europe's legacy processing platform and it was completely unrelated to the migration. Our global VisaNet platform was not affected. If you'd like more details, I direct you to our letter to the UK Parliament's Treasury Select Committee, which is posted on their website. Now let me say a few words about the technology migration. We are very happy with the progress made to date. As you know we completed the clearing and settlement migration in March and the authorizations migration began in April. We now have over 50% of our processing volume migrated for authorizations, which includes a number of our largest European clients. We remain on track to complete the technical migration by the end of the calendar year. To wrap up on Europe, the financial performance of the deal continues to exceed expectations. Vasant will get into more detail, but double-digit accretion we now expect in fiscal year 2018 is two years ahead of our original acquisition expectations. Moving on from Europe, let me shift to other markets around the world, starting in Asia. In India, we continue to be the market leader with payments volume growth well over 20% this quarter. We recently announced revised debit pricing to address regulator-driven changes in debit economics as the market evolves, particularly on transactions under INR 2,000, an equivalent of roughly $30. We expect incremental volume to largely offset this price reduction over time. We are also engaged with the Indian regulator to find possible solutions to best address their data localization concerns. So far this is a very productive dialogue, and we will keep you updated as our requirements are finalized. In Thailand, our local debit network is now live. We are now one of three debit networks operating in the country, the other two being regional operators. Visa is the only network to offer a unified single brand acceptance both in Thailand and globally bringing a consistent end user experience to the consumers there. The launch of our domestic network enables Visa to fully participate in the domestic payment market and continually drive digital payment innovations for consumers and businesses, while also fostering a financially inclusive ecosystem in Thailand. In Australia, we've seen impressive payment volume growth of about 20% in the last few quarters relative to the market average growth of 7%. This is a direct result of successful portfolio migrations tied to significant long-term exclusive contracts struck with existing clients as well as our continued growth momentum in both debit and contactless. Over 93% of all face-to-face transactions are now contactless in Australia. In Taiwan, more than 2 million Visa co-branded credit cards with Costco Taiwan and Cathay United Bank have been issued to date, which makes it the largest co-brand in the market. Let me also share a few quick highlights in other regions. CEMEA is at the center of our Visa on mobile, formerly known as mVisa efforts (00:10:00). We are live and gaining traction in a number of markets, including launches in Ukraine and Kazakhstan and in Kenya, Pesapal, a leading payments facilitator in East Africa providing merchants online and face-to-face payment processing, integrated Visa on mobile into its payments processing platform. And it will be making it available more than 21,000 businesses for online and in-store payments. To help support these small merchants grow their businesses, Visa is also rolling out a digital microlending partnership with Branch to provide preferential loan terms to qualified Visa merchants who accept Visa on mobile QR codes. Branch is a machine learning powered provider of mobile financial services to emerging markets and has the second most downloaded app in Kenya. In Latin America, we made a strategic investment in YellowPepper, a mobile payments pioneer in the region, to help accelerate innovation in digital payment technology. The initial focus will be growing tokenized payment opportunities, increasing access to our APIs, expanding the usage of push payments via Visa Direct. Together, we're already working with more than 70 clients in the region. In terms of advancements with Visa Direct, Visa Direct continues to grow rapidly fueled by geographic expansion, the enablement of new use cases and repeat customer usage. Volume has more than doubled in the past year and is beginning to have an impact on our overall debit volume growth, particularly in the United States. The Visa Direct platform can deliver transactions to our 2 billion Visa debit cards globally, has cross-border capabilities and has already sent transactions to more than 150 countries this fiscal year. More than 1 billion of those debit cards across almost 70 countries are enabled for Fast Funds. We are continuing to work with issuers around the world to upgrade the transaction speed to Fast Funds. Unlike many other real-time payment options, merchants and acquirers that already use our platform can now utilize global Fast Funds without any additional step once they are enabled as an issuer. There are three partnerships related to Visa Direct that I want to highlight. One, we're partnering with MoneyGram, the second largest money transfer provider in the world, to deliver domestic and cross-border remittances utilizing debit credentials to receive funds. Cross-border remittances is a large attractive market that currently has a lot of friction for people receiving funds. Second, we're partnering with Postmates, a logistics company that operates a network of couriers who deliver goods locally, to enable instant payouts to the delivery couriers in their fleet. Third, OnDeck launched a new Instant Funding feature for lines of credit for small businesses. Once a business registers their Visa Debit card, they can make a drawdown and receive their money transfer in seconds any time, day or night. Given that cash flow management is a critical issue for small businesses, the flexibility to receive funds when the bank is closed is very valuable. Not only is Visa Direct effective at capturing new payment flows, but it also stimulates our core business by increased spend per card. Based on a recent study of debit card users in the U.S., after receiving their first Visa Direct payment, they exhibit a continued level of incremental spend. And that transaction list was consistent for debit users with all levels of engagement, ranging from previously infrequent debit users to very active debit users. Let me shift to B2B. We're investing in existing solutions while also expanding into new payment flows. B2B payments through existing solutions represents over 11% of Visa's payment volume and are growing at a faster rate than Visa overall. With the approximately $20 trillion market sizing for existing solutions, we see significant growth opportunity for virtual cards and Visa Direct in particular. The virtual cards are increasingly important way which businesses transact with each other. We are now partnering with WEX, a leading commercial card issuer, serving the travel, insurance and media industries among others. This arrangement allows WEX and their corporate payment customers to use a Visa virtual card to enable global B2B payment. Additionally, the Fraedom integration is going well and response from our issuers has been very positive. We're in advanced discussions to utilize Fraedom more broadly with issuers in North America, Europe, and Asia. Lastly, we continue to expand our B2B offerings to new payment flows. While this is a very large market opportunity well beyond the size of what is currently addressable with existing solutions, it is complex and heterogeneous, and therefore will take time to fully capture the benefits. We are starting by focusing on high-value cross-border transactions, which we view to be one of the largest single pain points in B2B payments today. We're addressing this with our B2B Connect solution. We are now in pilot and are on track to expand the availability of B2B Connect in the first half of calendar year 2019. We continue to make great progress in contactless, a quick update. Global contactless penetration of domestic face-to-face transactions that run over our network was up approximately 2 percentage points since last quarter with 18 countries increasing at least 5 percentage points in the last three months. There are now 10 countries where over two-thirds of their domestic face-to-face transactions are contactless and over 30 countries that are at least one-third contactless. And those 30-plus countries, which excludes the United States, represent 70% of the non-U.S. Visa domestic face-to-face transactions in Q3. Transit continues to be a strong driver of contactless adoption around the globe. Announcements in the past quarter include both TransLink in Vancouver and Azienda Trasporti in Milan having enabled contactless payments at the transit gate. Metr\u00f4Rio, Rio's largest transit operator with 240 million annual riders, announced that they will begin accepting contactless payments at the transit gate with the initial launch scheduled for later this summer. Mumbai announced that its Integrated Ticketing System, which is used by 14 different transit agencies in and around the city that collectively carry 11 million people every day, will begin accepting contactless payments soon. And finally in the U.S., the New Jersey Transit agency announced that they would be joining New York's MTA and Boston's MBTA in enabling contactless payments at the gate. A quick update on Visa Digital Commerce Program often now referred to as the common button. Feedback continues to be very positive as we talked with more ecosystem participants, including merchants, acquirers, gateways, issuers, and digital platforms. EMVCo continues to make progress on three major work streams. First is the definition of the Secure Remote Commerce Mark, which will be used in merchant shopping and customer-facing applications to indicate to consumers which merchants and cards are enabled for Secure Remote Commerce; second, user experience standards that define the checkout flow; and thirdly, technical specifications for ecosystem participants so that everyone can begin coding. We expect the detailed technical specifications to be published by the fall of this year, followed by the user experience and branding specs later this year, maybe into early next year. We continue to work as quickly as possible with EMVCo to get the standards right. We don't expect the migrations of Visa Checkout will happen before the middle of next calendar year. The FIFA World Cup in Russia was an overwhelming success for Visa over the past two months. The client and consumer experiences provide a unique opportunity to showcase Visa's innovative \u2013 innovation and connect both clients and consumers to the evolving portfolio of Visa's offerings. Over 500 bank and merchant partners across 103 markets in 24 languages utilized the Visa sponsorship to support their local strategies. The Visa brand was very visible, canvassing the field board for over seven hours on broadcast during the 64 matches of the World Cup, which is estimated to have exceeded three billion unique viewers. Excluding those field boards, Visa had well over 5 billion digital impressions over the course of the tournament in 48 countries. The World Cup is on track to be the most viewed sporting event ever on digital platforms, setting streaming records in major markets including China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Finally, a few closing comments. We're now almost one-third of the way through our fiscal fourth quarter, and it's shaping up to be another strong year for Visa. We're currently in the midst of many strategic discussions that will inform where we invest over the next couple years, which obviously will flow into our fiscal 2019 budgeting and investment programs. We're focused on sustaining our strong business momentum as we close out fiscal year 2019 (sic) [2018] and on October 1 launch into 2019. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Thank you, Al. We're very pleased to report another strong quarter, with net revenue growth increasing to 15%, driven by continued momentum across all three of our business drivers. As reported on a GAAP basis, EPS grew 16%. This includes a special item, which I will describe in more detail in a moment. Adjusted to exclude this special item, EPS grew 39%, which includes a 10 percentage point benefit from the impact of U.S. tax reform. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year positively impacted net revenue growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points and EPS growth by approximately 3 percentage points. A few points to note. As we recently disclosed, based on progress in settlement discussions in the U.S. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation, we recorded a $600 million litigation provision and related tax benefit of $137 million in the third quarter. This special item is included in our reported GAAP results, with operating expense growth of 53% and EPS growth of 16%. Excluding this special item, adjusted operating expense growth is 14%, and adjusted EPS growth is 39%. Related to this, on June 28, we deposited an additional $600 million into the litigation escrow under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. Funding of the escrow triggers a conversion rate adjustment of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock, which has the same effect on EPS as repurchasing $600 million of class A common stock. Growth across business drivers continued at double-digits. Payments volume and processed transactions growth remained strong and steady at 11% and 12% respectively, with cross-border volume growth decelerating to 10%, primarily due to a stronger dollar. Client incentives are lower than expected due to some contract signing delays, as well as lower than forecast incentive levels. Contract signing delays added $0.01 to $0.02 to Q3 results. We expect higher client incentives in the fourth quarter due to these signing delays. Our tax rate benefited this quarter from the successful resolution of a tax audit. This is a non-recurring benefit of 2.9 percentage points in our GAAP tax rate, and 2.4 percentage points in our adjusted tax rate this quarter. We bought back 13.6 million shares of class A common stock, at an average price of $128.80 for $1.8 billion this quarter. Year-to-date buybacks totaled 46 million shares, at an average price of $119.60 or $5.5 billion. This leaves $5.8 billion available for share repurchases as of June 30. Including the impact of the conversion rate adjustment of class B shares to shares of class A common stock related to the $600 million deposit into the litigation escrow account, our effective year-to-date buyback totaled $6.1 billion. Moving now to a review of key business drivers in the third quarter. Payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 11% again this quarter. U.S. payments volume growth accelerated from 10% to 11% due to strong debit spending and commercial volume growth. U.S. consumer debit growth accelerated, fueled by positive macroeconomic conditions, Visa Direct, and rising gas prices. Commercial volume has been accelerating steadily in the past three quarters, with gains across small business credit, large and middle market programs. International payments volume also grew 11% on a constant dollar basis. Growth stepped up across Asia, driven by China, India, and Korea, and in Latin America, driven by Brazil. Growth across the Middle East and North Africa accelerated. Growth in Europe remains healthy. A strong dollar reduced this currency translation tailwind, especially in Latin America and Europe. As reported, constant dollar cross-border volume growth decelerated one percentage point from 11% in Q2 to 10% in Q3. As a reminder, both Q2 and Q3 of fiscal year 2018 are impacted by lapping a settlement delay in Europe last year. This contributed 1 percentage point to cross-border growth in the second quarter and reduced growth by the same amount in the third quarter. In addition, we have fully lapped the drag from an e-commerce payments platform shifting acquiring of UK cardholder volumes to the UK from another EU location. This reduced cross-border growth by over 2 percentage points in the second quarter and did not have an impact on the third quarter's growth. The impact of each of these items on net revenue was de minimis. Both U.S. and Europe outbound commerce growth are down from their peaks, but continue at double-digits. Inbound commerce into the U.S. remained at double-digit growth rates, but decelerated with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Europe inbound commerce growth also slowed but remained at double-digit levels adjusted for the settlement impact. Inbound commerce into Russia accelerated with the FIFA World Cup. Mexico and the Caribbean benefited from the continued recovery in tourism. Cross-border growth was also strong across the Middle East and North Africa. The sharp weakening of currencies relative to the dollar significantly slowed outbound commerce into Latin America. Processed transactions grew a healthy 12% for the third quarter in a row. Through July 21, U.S. payments volumes are up 11%, constant dollar cross-border volumes also grew 11%, and processed transactions grew 13%. Turning to financial results, net revenue growth accelerated to 15%, service revenue grew 13%, data processing revenues were up 19%. International revenue increased 16%. Data processing and international revenues benefited from pricing, which went into effect this quarter. The currency translation benefit was lower this quarter versus the second quarter due to a stronger dollar. While client incentive as a percent of gross revenue increased from 20.3% in Q2 to 20.8% in Q3, they were lower than we expected again this quarter. This was driven by lower than forecast incentive, as well as some contract signing delays. These delayed contract signings are expected to shift into the fourth quarter. As compared with the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, client incentives were up 20%, as many of the contract conversions in Europe were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. As reported on a GAAP basis, operating expenses grew 53%. Adjusted to exclude the special item related to the MDL provision, operating expenses grew 14%, primarily driven by personnel costs and marketing. Headcount was still ramping up in the third quarter of the last fiscal year, following our global restructuring. This year-over-year increase reflects continued investment in personnel focused on our key growth initiatives. Similar to the second quarter, this quarter also reflects the increase in our 401(k) matching contribution for U.S. employees, and higher employee incentive accruals tied to better than expected year-to-date performance. Marketing investment was higher than last year due to spending around the FIFA World Cup in Russia. Finally, exchange rate shifts added 1 percentage point to expense growth. Non-operating expense was 34% lower than the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, driven by higher interest income on our cash balances, as well as a gain on the sale of an investment. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%. Excluding the $137 million tax benefit related to the MDL litigation provision, our adjusted effective tax rate was 18.2%. This includes a 6 percentage point reduction related to U.S. tax reform, and a 2.4 percentage point benefit from a non-recurring audit settlement. Europe continues to exceed our financial expectations once again this year and relative to the original acquisition model. We now expect accretion from the Visa Europe acquisition to be at double-digit levels in fiscal year 2018. This exceeds our original acquisition expectations, and it's two years ahead of schedule. The integration phase is nearing completion, also well ahead of schedule. As Al indicated, the complex process of converting clients to commercial agreements is complete, and the technology integration is on track for completion by the end of this calendar year. With the integration phase complete, we're entering growth phase. We have many attractive opportunities for growth across Europe as Al described. With that, our outlook for fiscal year 2018. There is no change to our outlook for net revenue growth, operating expense growth, and operating margin. As a reminder, we expect net revenue growth to be in the low double-digits on a nominal dollar basis, including approximately 1 percentage point of positive foreign currency impact. Given that the weakening of the dollar accelerated starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the exchange rate tailwind moderates in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. At current exchange rates, the currency translation impact on the fourth quarter net revenues is neutral. We expect to be at the low end of the 21.5% to 22% range for incentives as a percent of gross revenue. In the fourth quarter, client incentives are expected to be above the range due to the delayed contract signings. As we discussed last quarter, full-year operating expense growth is forecast to be in the low double-digits adjusted for special items in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018. Since investments ramped during the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect expense growth to moderate to the mid-single-digit range in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted tax rate including the impact of U.S. tax reform is expected to be between 20.5% and 21.5%. This lower range reflects the tax rate realized year-to-date and includes non-recurring benefits from our tax initiative of 1 to 1.5 percentage points this year. We also had a 6 point reduction from U.S. tax reform. In fiscal year 2019, we will lose the non-recurring tax benefits, but gain 1 to 2 points from a full year of the new U.S. federal tax rate. On a GAAP nominal dollar basis, we expect EPS growth in the high 50s. On an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis, we are increasing our EPS growth outlook from the high 20s to the low 30s. This includes 1.5 percentage points of positive foreign currency impact and 9 to 10 percentage point benefit from the impact of U.S. tax reform. As a reminder, we will adopt the new revenue recognition standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2019. If applied to fiscal year 2018 reported results, we expect the impact of the new standard would be a reduction in reported net revenue growth of approximately 50 to 60 basis points. This impact is partially dependent on the terms of new incentive deals executed in the fourth quarter and going forward and therefore will vary. At this point, we estimate that the application of the new revenue standard may be a modest headwind in fiscal year 2019 and approximately 50 to 60 basis points reduction in reported net revenue growth. We will continue to assess the impact on fiscal year 2019, and we'll provide an update when we discuss our outlook in October. As a reminder, the new accounting standard has no impact on cash flows or the economic value of our business. In summary, business trends remained strong globally. Revenue growth has continued to accelerate. Bolstered by successful tax initiatives and U.S. tax reform, our fiscal year 2018 outlook anticipates adjusted EPS growth in the low 30% range. This will result in adjusted EPS being up over 60% since the end of fiscal year 2016. The Europe acquisition continues to track ahead of expectations, driving double-digit accretion by the end of the second year well ahead of schedule. As Al described, we're making good progress on a broad range of initiatives that are laying the groundwork to sustain high levels of secular growth into the future. With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Thank you. And with that, Katie, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question today comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Al, you talked about increasing the yield \u2013 the increasing yield part of the upside in Europe from those three sources. Could you maybe dimensionalize the runway versus where we are today? And then just a clarification, Vasant, on the data processing revenue pricing change, did that happen at the early part of this quarter? And was it a specific region, or was it across the board? Thanks.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Sanjay, we, as I think you know, typically don't get into the specifics on pricing. But I would just remind you that Visa Europe, until recently had operated as an association and therefore had different motivation. So, we have said before that we think that there is real pricing opportunity as we look at Europe over the next number of years. And we've started to take some of that pricing and we'll continue to over time.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: On the data processing side, yeah, we did indicate to you, when we provided our outlook for this fiscal year, that the pricing this fiscal year would be in the second half of the year. So, most of the price increases around the world were effective April 1, and that's why you're seeing some of the impact starting this quarter. And we generally don't get into which region we took pricing in or how much and so on as you know.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question, Katie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nHarshita Rawat - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Al and Vasant, I want to ask a question about India, which, in many ways, has become the next place to watch in payments. And as you know, there's a lot happening on the ground with local players, Internet giants and government-backed schemes. So my question for you is, what's your strategy to gain traction in this extremely competitive market, especially versus some very nimble local players and also local schemes, which have certain advantages?\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Well, thank you for giving us the opportunity to talk about India. I mean, we're very pleased with what's happening in India. The cash disbursement opportunity is great. I'd remind everybody that we are the market leader in India. We're well-positioned. We have greater than 50% share in India. We're continuing to grow at very healthy clips in 2018, and that's growing over very, very high growth in the prior year of 2017. Our total focus is on growth, and the enablers of that are driving acceptance and driving innovation in the market. We're scaling QR code acceptance. We're partnering with issuers on driving awareness and usage, and we're working with issuers on things like tokenization, contactless, and scan and pay (sic) [scan to pay]. There's no question that India is a market where there is a number of competitors who have come into the space, but it is also a market that is in very, very early stages of its maturation in payments. And we believe that having been in India now for over 30 years and our various capabilities that we are well-positioned to get more than our fair share of growth as India matures over the next years, and frankly, decade plus. So we feel very good about it.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Yeah, a few other things to add in terms of the competitors. Clearly, with some of the players now becoming payment banks, it changes the nature of the relationship we can have with them. Payment banks can do issuance of debit cards and prepaid cards. But they're not allowed to issue credit cards, but they can use debit and prepaid. And a lot of people don't like to load wallets if they can just use a debit or prepaid card, far more convenient. So it's not \u2013 you shouldn't be surprised to see partnerships emerge with people that you might have thought of as competitors, because there's mutual benefit in that. There's also the opportunity to have acquiring licenses granted to some of the payment banks, which opens up a large amount of acceptance that has been built over time in a proprietary kind of way. Similarly, with some of the other entrants, what everybody is doing is essentially creating the pay electronically habit, which is good for all of us. The rising tide lifts all boats, so there's generally benefit as you can see that our business is also growing at a very healthy clip. So all in all, I mean, as Al said, it's very early days, and there would be a variety of new partnerships formed. We are talking to a whole range of players. And we would say you should stay tuned as things develop.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Saw the results. Just want to ask about the incentives. I guess, one of the comments about incentives coming in lower than expected was a lower forecast. So just trying to figure if that was lower volumes coming from clients, or was there something in the forecast that's changed when we think about it going forward? And in the fourth quarter, does that become the kind of the high watermark in kind of looking at seasonally for incentives typically, so we should see as a percentage of revenue \u2013 of gross revenue that the incentives in the fourth quarter becomes kind of the highest percentage and then it kind of drops from there? Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: So two different questions. So on the first one, yes, the incentives coming in lower, a piece of it was clearly real reductions in incentives, i.e., incentives being lower than we expected. And that was because the incentive spend was not at levels \u2013 we make a bunch of assumptions when we do these things as to what we might need to do from an incentive standpoint. And in this case, that was a real reduction from what we expected, and therefore we are saying, for the full year for example, we now expect incentives as a percent of gross revenues to actually be at the low end of the range that we gave you last quarter, we narrowed the range this quarter, we're saying it will be at the low end of the range, because incentives are actually coming in lower than we had forecast when we gave you our outlook last year. So that's a real reduction, it's not a delay. In terms of the fourth quarter being high watermark, last year, the fourth quarter number was the high watermark, because we were doing this big conversion from rebates to incentives in Europe. And just based on historical trends in Europe, a lot of the deals bought down towards the end of our fiscal year. And so they were high in the fourth quarter. This year again, we will probably have incentives being higher as a percent of gross revenue in the fourth quarter. I don't think you should view that as some kind of seasonality, it's just a reflection of what happened in the past couple of years, and just there timing was for renewal of certain deals and exactly what was going on in Europe and so on. So, I don't think you should carry that forward as sort of something that would happen every year.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDaniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. So I just had a question on this pivot to growth for you guys in Europe, and in particular, around some of the market share commentary, Al, you mentioned. Can you give us a flavor, at least some idea about what you're thinking in terms of target markets? And do those markets look more debit-centric, credit-centric? Should we be concerned about what that could do to yields as you start to make that pivot? And are there any real large sizable buckets that we could start thinking through in terms of investment as you make that pivot? Thank you.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Well, Dan, I'd say a couple things. I don't want to necessarily give away many, many details of our specific strategies. But, look, our business in \u2013 the business that we bought in Europe is obviously very concentrated in the UK and a few other markets and has 37 markets as we look at it in Europe. It's also largely what we inherited was actually a debit business. And so I think as we look at pivoting now off of the integration work that has been really dominating a lot of time and management attention over the last two years to really look at growth, I think that looking at other markets beyond the UK and France and Spain, and markets like the Nordics, markets like Germany, markets like Italy, and looking at moving beyond debit to credit are very high on our list. I think additionally, we think there's the possibility to pick up some processing capabilities, where \u2013 pick up some processing where our capabilities might be better and richer than some of the offerings in the markets around Europe today. I think as we think about some of our capabilities that we'll be able to deliver once we're fully migrated over to VisaNet and our ability to introduce the capabilities that exist on VisaNet ranging from risk capabilities to fraud capabilities to tokenization, et cetera, I think there's a great opportunity in the continent of Europe in various pockets to pick up volumes. So that's where I would say that we're looking at putting our investments, Dan.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan: Thanks. I'm glad to see the revenue acceleration here. I wanted to ask on Europe, just kind of a follow-on to Dan's question. Just now that you're ahead of schedule, two years ahead of schedule, has your total synergy expectation changed at all for Visa Europe? And is there anything to consider with Brexit and some other factors? I know there are some market review of a card acquiring business, I know that's not directly impactful to you, but anything we should consider today on Europe? Thanks.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Well, I'll let Vasant comment on the accretion. You know Tien-Tsin, we've looked at Brexit from any number of ways, and it's still unsure exactly where and how it's going to play out, as we all know, the politics in the UK right now is maybe not quite as interesting as the politics in the U.S., but it's awfully close. And how that's going to play out, who knows, but our view is that we don't see a lot of impact on our business from Brexit. We'll continue to look at it. We looked at it a number of times in depth, but we don't really see anything that concerns us there. Vasant, do you want to comment on the...\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Yeah.  ...accretion?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: On the accretion side, as I indicated in the comments, we are at double-digits right now, so that's higher than what we thought we would achieve over a period of time. I think we said high single-digits over a four-year timeframe. So it's higher than what we expected, and it is faster. Some of it is driven by things \u2013 we were fairly conservative when we did the acquisition modeling. Certainly, we've had better outcomes on pricing, overall volume growths have been stronger than we expected. In addition to that, we were able to do the tax restructuring, and that created some real value. We've generally achieved all the other benefits we thought from a cost standpoint. So on all those fronts, things have performed better than we expected, and these are all very sustainable and will continue for sure. And as Al said, we see additional opportunity for yield improvement, and we will have some additional cost savings as we finish the technology integration. But as with everything else, once you get into a business you realize what other opportunities you have. So clearly, we'll be investing in some of the growth opportunities that Al talked about. We're clearly going to be beefing up, as Al has said before, resources that are more in market rather than based at our hub in London, and we'll be increasing our investment in driving some of the growth initiatives that Al mentioned. So things do change, but we did want to sort of give you a clean look at what our accretion was at the end of year, too, when it's still possible to cleanly look at what the business could have been without Visa Europe and is with Visa Europe. As you go further down the road, it gets muddier because things change. A lot of things change. But right now, at least, it's clean enough to give you a point of view.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nLisa Dejong Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. I have a question about Visa Direct and the applicability of Visa Direct for consumer bill pay, given how large a component of e-commerce consumer bill pay is, and also it's been a primary use case for competitive networks like fast ACH, et cetera. You didn't mention in your comments about Visa Direct any specific partnerships related to bill pay, so I'm \u2013 would love just some color on what the hurdles are to using Visa Direct for like online bill pay. And do you see that use case emerging and potentially diminishing the competitive threat from fast ACH?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: It's very much and a very important use case of Visa Direct. I think the only reason Al didn't mention it is because he was talking about some of the newer use cases. There are four core use cases that are driving Visa Direct volumes today. Certainly P2P, you're all familiar with that, that's a big one. Disbursements, we've talked a lot about that Disbursements of all kinds \u2013 healthcare, the gig economy, and so on. Bill pay is the third and really important use case, that's well underway. We're enabling a variety of bill pay merchants right now through Visa Direct. And then the fourth is faster payments to merchants. These are things like services that acquirers are offering merchants where they can get money faster than waiting for the normal settlement schedule. So those are four use cases that are driving Visa Direct as we speak. What we were talking about was some of the newer use cases that are being enabled in the future.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is now open.\nDavid J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. So I guess just on the international revenue, a really nice driver has been, just how the growth has been mid to high-teens despite constant currency cross-border volume only growing like 10%, 11%, or so. I'm wondering, is that gap sustainable with pricing and mix? Or with FX coming in a little bit, should those two kind of converge a little and grow more in line with each other?\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: I'd say a couple of things and Vasant can add. As I look at our business, Dave, over the next number of years, a lot of our \u2013 the bulk of our growth is going to come overseas, and it's something we're putting a lot of time and attention to. And I personally spent a lot of my personal time overseas. And so, I think we're going to continue to see us invest in these markets, the cash opportunity \u2013 cash displacement opportunity is great. Some of the things we \u2013 just talking about Visa Direct and some of the use cases, the geographic expansion of Visa Direct into a number of these markets is going to be extremely helpful in driving volume, as well as some of the capabilities that we will continue to introduce in these markets that might be a little bit further along in some cases in the U.S. So it's going to continue to be \u2013 our aim is for it to continue to be a real source of growth.  You also had a question on the delta between the revenue growth and the constant dollar volume growth, yeah, it's a little harder for you from the outside to understand the drivers of that difference, and the three broad areas that can cause a difference: one as you pointed out is FX and that's clearly helped in the last few quarters and it helped more last quarter than it did this quarter. As you know, the dollar strengthened, so the FX benefit was greater last quarter on the international revenues than it is this quarter, but it was still a benefit. The second is mix. So I wouldn't underestimate the importance of mix, which corridors are growing does matter, some corridors are higher yielding than others. For example, our cross-border volume growth includes what we call intra-EU cross-border volume. Intra-EU cross-border volume, as you know, does not have economics very different than domestic volume within the EU; and therefore when that grows faster than let's say the rest of the cross-border business that can be a drag and vice versa. So mix is a factor, which is harder for you to see from the outside. And the third is of course pricing; and this quarter we had some benefit from pricing. So there's three different factors and they have a \u2013 they interplay with each other. You're right, as we get in the fourth quarter as the FX benefit moderates a bit, that won't help as much just as it helped less in the third quarter, but then there are the other factors to consider, too, like pricing and mix.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks, guys. So I mean, you're trending better than the first quarters \u2013 few quarters, so other than higher incentives just to be clear, is there anything else limiting your ability on the top-line to raise? I think it's just incentives to be clear. And then, Al, I mean, cross-border seems to be trending better than last year, obviously, in the double-digits again. I just want to hone in for a moment on the sustainability on that kind of trend in your mind just given e-comm is a higher percentage mix now. And if that should hold up in your view, and then if incentives as a percentage of that could be \u2013 basically incentives as a percentage of revenue should be lower with cross-border being stronger? Thanks, guys.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Well, I'll take the second part of your question. I think that \u2013 I don't want to be in the predicting business, but I will tell you this that we want to be making sure that cross-border is growing at as healthy of levels it possibly can and e-commerce is in fact an enabler to that. I think as long as \u2013 and in addition to that, as long as the economies of the world stayed strong and we're seeing people feel comfortable about traveling, that's certainly also going to greatly contribute to cross-border continuing to grow. It's an area of real emphasis for us and real emphasis for the work we do with our issuer. So it's an area of great focus, and we expect it to hold up.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: So on your other question about the revenue growth trajectory, I'll just repeat two things that I mentioned in my earlier remarks. One was in the fourth quarter \u2013 in the third quarter we had FX exchange rate tailwind of 1.5 percentage points, so it added 1.5 points to our net revenue growth. If you just take today's exchange rates and given that the dollar really started to weaken in the fourth quarter of last year, the FX impact on net revenue growth is close to neutral. So you do have that one change. And then the other one you pointed out was incentives represent of gross revenue were 20.8% in Q3, and we said would be higher in the fourth quarter. So there are two factors that are different in the fourth quarter as we sit here today in terms of impacting the net revenue growth rate \u2013 the reported net revenue growth rate.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Al, relative to some of the comments you made before about the various applications of Visa Direct all the way from remittance, P2P, bill pay and direct deposit for merchants, et cetera, as you project forward over the next few years, can you give us any kind of sense about, say, four or five years out, how big a piece of revenue or percentage of total company revenue those various opportunities could be collectively for you at that point?\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: Jim, we're not going to make forecast three to five years out on anything. I would say this though, that obviously we've been talking about Visa Direct for a little over a year or year-and-a-half now. We're actually starting to meaningfully see it in our numbers. You're continuing to hear us talk about it in bullish terms. I think it's important to emphasize that this is an operational capability that exists today. It's global. It's a capability that's attracting partners to us to try to talk about different use cases. Visa Direct is running on our VisaNet platform, and therefore has all the associated speed, security and scale that's associated with it. And VisaNet has the capability to provide a bunch of services that's a lot of other real-time payment networks don't, including things like dispute resolution, chargeback, risk and fraud tools. So when I look at the opportunity, what excites me about Visa Direct is: A, it's grounded in our core VisaNet platform, but it has multiple tentacles for growth, both geographic growth as well as growth in use cases and its \u2013 and segments. It's a capability that supports P2P, it supports B2C, it supports government to consumers, it supports small business to small business. So I think when you look at it as a capability that cuts across ability to grow via segments, grow via geography, grow via use case, it certainly is something, Jim, that we're excited about and continue to \u2013 and we'll continue to invest against.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: We have time for one more question, Katie.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJames E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to quickly go back to a question that Tien-Tsin asked a few minutes ago and specifically on the UK review of some of the acquiring businesses. In that review it looked like they also said they may be looking at scheme fees, et cetera. Just wondering if you can help give a little light as to what you think they may be looking at, and kind of your discussions with that regulatory body as far as you've had them? Thanks.\nAlfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.: James, this is very early. It's not unusual at all for the regulators in the UK to be looking at any and all aspects of payments. This particular piece is focused on acquirers; it's not focused on Visa. And I think it's safe to say that we will be watching it closely, certainly providing whatever support we need to provide to acquirers as they address any queries from the PSR in the UK. But at the moment, again, this is just very early days and there's really nothing to report. There's no real clarity about what, if anything, they're specifically looking at. Sometimes these things open as just simple queries as to wanting to get information. And other times they result in action and sometimes they result in inaction, and we'll just got to watch this and see how it plays out, James.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail. Thanks again and have a great evening.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: Mike, thank you very much, and good afternoon to everybody and thanks for joining us today. Before I begin my comments, I would like to officially welcome Mike Milotich to the role as our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. While Mike is new to this position, he's a veteran at Visa and he joined us in 2011. Most recently, Mike led our corporate finance team. And before that, Mike held finance positions at both PayPal and American Express. I know you're going to find that Mike is extraordinarily knowledgeable about the payments industry, Visa's business and our financials. He's an experienced leader who's been a great partner to Vasant and myself in his prior role, and I'm delighted that Mike has taken on this role. And I know you'll enjoy working with him in the months and years ahead. So, I welcome and congratulate Mike, and now let me turn to our financial results. Visa had a terrific second quarter that greatly exceeded our expectations. Revenue growth was 13%, and many of our key business drivers accelerated compared to the first quarter. The broad-based improvement in global economic growth that began last year has well actually continued. Payments volume growth on a constant dollar basis accelerated by more than 0.5 point versus the prior quarter, fueled by debit spending globally. Debit growth of 11% was up 2 percentage points versus last quarter with both U.S. debit and international debit growth accelerating by similar amounts. Credit growth was flat to the last quarter at 10%. Year-over-year payments growth was between 9% and 17% across our six reported regions and countries, which is an indication of the broad-based global strength we are seeing. Cross-border growth on a constant dollar basis accelerated more than 2 percentage points versus the prior quarter, driven by faster growth in virtually every region. Growth both in and out of Europe and the U.S. was strong. Growth inbound to the U.S. reached double digits for the first time in more than four years. Globally, both card-not-present and face-to-face growth accelerated by approximately 2.5 percentage points versus the prior quarter, with card-not-present growth continuing to outpace face-to-face spend growth. Investments in talent and markets around the world as well as marketing focused on the Winter Olympics and the upcoming World Cup led to double-digit expense growth on an adjusted basis. Our tax rate was 19% due to the execution of a specific state tax initiative and U.S. tax reform. EPS growth on a GAAP basis was 523%, but adjusted for two special items last year, growth was 30%. These strong results have led us to raise our full year outlook for both revenue and profit. We had a number of deal wins in this quarter. Visa and Capital One executed a new agreement that continues our partnership in the affluent consumer and small business space. Capital One is one of our largest issuers, and we're excited to continue our partnership. Also in the U.S., IKEA has selected Visa as the network for their new co-brand program. We signed a multiyear debit issuing agreement with CIBC in Canada. In Asia, we renewed our consumer credit and commercial partnership with Shinhan Korea, the largest issuer in Korea. We're partnering with Citi and P-Crom (05:00) to launch the new exclusive co-brand card in Taiwan, and we also renewed a number of our largest partnerships with clients in Japan, China and Thailand. We renewed Banco Davivienda our second largest client in Colombia. And we renewed our debit agreement with Mashreq Bank (05:21) in the UAE. We also returned approximately $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the second quarter consisting of $2 billion of share repurchases and nearly $0.5 billion through dividends. Vasant will take you through our results and our revised full year outlook in more detail when I complete my remarks. Let me turn to Europe. Our technical migration in Europe is well underway and off to a great start. The clearing and settlement migration was completed successfully over the months of February and March with no major issues. Over 500 clients were migrated. Authorization migrations begin later this month. Unlike the settlement migrations, which occurred in two major tranches, the authorization migrations will occur client-by-client over a longer period of time. We remain on track to complete the technical migration by the end of the calendar year. The conversion of European client contracts to commercial incentives is largely done. For the few deals that are outstanding, the terms are finalized, but the contacts are taking longer than expected to be signed. We expect to be finished in Q3. Overall, we are quite pleased with the business we have secured. We reviewed and transitioned over 100 contracts to new commercial terms, many highly contested by our competitors. Of course, we would have liked to win them all, but retaining almost all of these clients does exceed our assumptions made at the time of the Visa Europe acquisition. Now that we're done transitioning our existing clients to incentive contracts, we can shift more focus to growing our business in new ways in Europe. In terms of digital advancement, last week, we introduced the Visa Digital Commerce program, which will provide consumers with a simple experience with more security and less friction to utilize their cards for digital payments. Our vision is to create a consistent and secure digital shopping experience across browsers and devices that largely eliminate the need to enter card, account numbers and passwords. Online shopping should be as simple as it is in the physical world, making the checkout process easy with a single pay button. We aim to de-clutter the checkout page to streamline the checkout process. The program will incorporate our token technology and is based on the EMVCo Secure Remote Commerce framework. We're going to provide more updates on an ongoing basis as we move forward. The Visa Digital Commerce program is consistent with our other initiatives and investments to reduce friction from digital payments while maintaining high security standards. A few examples of other actions we've taken to reduce friction from digital payments include: our partnership with PayPal, which began in the U.S. and has extended to Asia and Europe, which eliminates ACH steering while also enabling PayPal users to cash out to their Visa card utilizing Visa Direct. In fact, overall, our partnership with PayPal has gone well, and we continue to discuss ways to work together, including collaborating on a number of tokenization initiatives. Our acquisition of CardinalCommerce about a year ago enhanced our authentication capability while also reducing transaction latency and improving the customer experience for merchants. Netflix, one of Visa's top digital merchants globally, recently expanded their card-on-file token program to include countries in both Europe and the Latin America regions. And with card on file tokens now being provisioned in countries across all Visa regions. Visa Direct continues to gain traction in markets globally. We are beginning to see the network effect taking hold as scaled originators, such as acquirers and technology platforms, continue to use Visa's capabilities to push funds in real-time over our network. This network effect, combined with broader consumer and merchant awareness, is fueling geographic expansion and rapid growth across all use cases. P2P, for example, is growing rapidly in a number of markets around the world. Our issuer clients as well as third-party providers, such as Square Cash, PayPal, Venmo and Facebook have enabled their customers to send money to one another using cards. Disbursements continue to grow in a number of different industries such as ridesharing, insurance and alternative lending. Companies such as Wirecard, Worldpay, Adyen and Stripe are enabling their clients to use these capabilities. Instant merchant deposit for small merchants continues to expand. PayPal Braintree recently joined existing partners such as Worldpay, who launched in 2017; and Square, who was the first to launch in 2015, to enable their merchants to receive their funds within minutes by initiating a push to their card. And finally, bill payment, where consumers can pay credit card, utility and telecom bills by initiating a push of funds from their debit card. The application of this capability can vary from market to market, so let me share two examples with you. In Singapore, four of our top seven issuers have embedded our capability in their digital banking channels, including mobile apps, to allow customers to pay their credit card bills issued by another financial institution with a push of funds from their debit card. In India, consumers can pay for utilities and telecom services by scanning the QR code on their bill with their banking app, and funds will flow from the consumer's bank account to the merchant via Visa Direct. Turning to B2B, we continue to make progress on our strategy of enhancing the value that Visa brings to business payments, both through Visa capabilities and through partnerships. In March, we acquired Fraedom, a Software-as-a-Service company, providing payments management solutions for financial institutions. Fraedom was a partner of ours for almost 10 years and underlies Visa's IntelliLink Spend Management, a core platform for Visa's commercial and small business clients. Fraedom will strengthen and expand Visa's business solutions. We're already seeing increased interest from several large issuers about our B2B capability following the announcement of the acquisition. In February, we expanded our partnership with Amazon Business, launching in Germany with Degussa Bank. The partnership brings together information from Amazon Business purchases and Visa's processing, helping business clients spend less time on purchase reconciliation. In January, we announced a partnership with NovoPayment, a Miami-based fintech that enables digital financial and transaction services through a cloud-based platform that supports mass disbursement and collections. The partnership will help drive digital payment services for B2B transactions in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our initial pilot with NovoPayment has helped two leading urban delivery services automate real-time disbursements to delivery personnel. Relative to contactless, we continue to make great progress in contactless. Twelve months ago, approximately one in eight domestic face-to-face transactions that run over our network globally were contactless. Today, contactless accounts for almost one in five transactions globally. Just in the past three months alone, contactless penetration has increased by 9 percentage points to 37% in Russia. It's increased 7 percentage points to 56% in the UK. And it's increased 4 percentage points to 52% in Canada. Just yesterday, Transport for London announced that on average, around 2.5 million contactless journeys are made across London's bus, tube and rail services every day. Since early 2016, the proportion of pay-as-you-go journeys made using contactless has risen from 25% to more than 50% today. And more than four of every five contactless journeys on Transport for London is made using Visa. In February, we announced 14 new technology partners from across 10 countries that will participate in the Visa Ready for Transit program to promote commuting with contactless. Visa Ready helps accelerate the adoption of new technologies by ensuring solutions meet Visa's security standards and specifications. New York, Sydney, Miami and Boston have all announced that they plan to introduce contactless payment in the coming years. Spurred by the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, Japan's largest retailer, AEON, will introduce checkout terminals supporting Visa contactless payment at approximately 100,000 registers at AEON Group stores between March of 2019 and March of 2020, including supermarkets and drugstores nationwide. The U.S. is in the early stages of adopting contactless, but we are laying groundwork to enable the market. In our experience, this groundwork stage takes 12 to 24 months. And once sufficient momentum is built, contactless adoption tends to take off rapidly. For example, it took 24 months to go from 1% to 7% contactless penetration in Australia and then another 24 months to go from 7% to 50%. That experience is not unique to Australia as we've seen similar trajectories around the globe. In the past 12 months, contactless penetration has increased from 32% to 64% in Denmark, from 31% to 53% in Spain, and 5% to 37% in Russia. In the U.S. in the past year, we've enabled an additional 10 of the top 100 merchants with contactless, bringing contactless to a total of 56 of the top 100 merchants. We are also increasing consumer awareness. This quarter we launched a national marketing campaign through our Olympics sponsorship that prominently featured contactless, which was seen by nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults. And speaking of the Olympics, the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang were a success for Visa this quarter. As the official and exclusive payment technology partner of the Olympic Winter Games, we deliver unique value to our clients when they leverage our partnership. Over 350 bank and merchant partners across 32 markets and in five languages utilized the Visa sponsorship to support their local strategies. We work together with our clients to come up with all kinds of unique campaign, so let me share a couple of examples with you. In collaboration with Lotte Card, the financial arm of South Korean-based retailer Lotte Department Store, Visa unveiled three limited edition wearable payment devices, stickers, badges and gloves that could be used for contactless payments. And approximately 100,000 wearables were sold between November and March. Another major Korean partner issued over 500,000 official PyeongChang 2018 themed cards in the months preceding the games. And similar to the Olympics, our FIFA sponsorship can also be leveraged by our clients. And for the upcoming World Cup in Russia, we expect more than 550 bank and merchant partners in over 100 markets to utilize our FIFA sponsorship. So, a few closing points. Visa recently celebrated our 10-year anniversary as a public company on March 19. The business has flourished in that time. Cards in force doubled from 1.6 billion to 3.3 billion. Payments volume almost tripled from $2.7 trillion to $7.8 trillion, and our net revenue did triple from $6 billion to $19 billion. Our total shareholder return for the period was 837%, which is 5x the S&P 500 during the same period. Core to our success is Visa's ability to anticipate future trends and evolve. Even with our success to date, there is still tremendous room for growth with tens of trillions of dollars in opportunity across consumer cash, checks and B2B. We continue to execute on our growth strategy and look forward to the next 10 years. The progress we've made in the first half of fiscal year 2018 furthers our confidence in the long-term investments we're making to drive profitable growth in the rapidly changing payments environment. With that, let me turn it over to my partner and our CFO, Vasant.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Thank you, Al. The strong growth trends we started the year with accelerated in the second quarter and our results exceeded our expectations. Net revenues were up 13%. On a GAAP basis, which includes special items last year related to the reorganization of Visa Europe and other Visa subsidiaries, EPS was up 523%. Adjusting last year's results for these special items, EPS was up 30%, including a 10 percentage point benefit from the impact of U. S. tax reform. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year positively impacted net revenue growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points and EPS growth by approximately 2 percentage points. Our earnings release provides you with a schedule that adjusts GAAP net income and EPS for these special items. A few points to note, a robust global economy continues to drive double-digit constant dollar payment volume growth. Cross-border growth accelerated, helped by a weaker dollar. Inbound commerce into the U.S. grew at double-digits for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Outbound commerce from Europe was also up double-digits, as the euro and pound have strengthened. Acceleration of cross-border growth in these two important corridors was faster than we expected. We have completed our post acquisition initiative to restructure all important client contracts in Europe to competitive commercial terms. While all terms have been agreed, the signing of some contracts will happen in the third quarter. As a result, client incentives were lower than we expected in the second quarter, adding 1 point to net revenue growth and $0.02 to EPS. These delayed client incentives will largely be recognized in the third quarter. Our tax rate in the second quarter benefited from the successful resolution of a state tax initiative we have been working on for several years. In addition to a recurring benefit in our effective state tax rate, we recognized a non-recurring 2.5 point reduction in our tax rate this quarter for prior years. Based on our outperformance in the second quarter, we are raising our outlook for the year. We now expect low double-digit net revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth in the high-20 range. As we indicated previously, U.S. tax reform add 9 to 10 points to our EPS growth rate. We bought back 16.9 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $120.39 or $2 billion this quarter. Year-to-date, buybacks totaled 32.4 million shares at an average price of $115.73 or $3.8 billion. This leaves $7.5 billion available for share repurchases as of March 31. Moving now to a review of key business drivers in the second quarter, payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 11%. U.S. payments volume growth of over 10% was 0.5 percentage point higher than last quarter. U.S. consumer debit accelerated 2 percentage points with strength across retail and every day spend segments. U.S. consumer credit growth remained robust at 11%, with continued strong growth in travel categories. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 11%, up 1 percentage point versus last quarter. Growth was strong across Asia, driven by China and Japan. Growth stepped up in Latin America, helped by Brazil. Growth in Europe remained stable and strong. Cross-border volume growth accelerated 2.5 percentage points on a constant dollar basis to over 11%. The drag from an e-commerce payments platform shifting acquiring of UK cardholder volumes to the UK from another EU location which we mentioned in the past three quarters, reduced cross-border growth by over 2 percentage points. We will fully lap this change in the third quarter. Partially offsetting this drag we are lapping a settlement delay in Europe last year. As a reminder, some volume that would normally have settled in March shifted into the first week of April last year. This contributed 1 percentage point to cross-border growth this quarter and will reduce growth by the same amount in the third quarter. The impact of each of these items on net revenue was de minimis. Growth of inbound commerce into the U.S. reached double digits for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2014, helped by a weakening dollar as well as initiatives to grow cross-border volume that are bearing fruit. Outbound spend from Europe, excluding intra-Europe transactions, also accelerated into the double-digit driven by the stronger euro and pound. Outbound spend from the U.S. and inbound volumes into Europe continued to hold up despite these currency shifts. Other markets with notable inbound commerce growth include Russia, the Middle East and several countries in Southeast Asia. Outbound commerce accelerated from Mexico, Japan and the Middle East. Processed transactions growth was flat to last quarter at a healthy 12% with acceleration in the U.S. offset by lapping India demonetization and some new business in Europe in the prior year's quarter. Through April 21, U.S. payments volumes are up 9%. Constant dollar cross-border volumes grew 6% as reported. Adjusting for the impact of the settlement delay in Europe, cross-border volumes grew 10%. Processed transactions grew 9%. The shift in timing of the Easter holiday impacted growth across all three metrics during the first three weeks of April. We expect the impact of the Easter shift to be de minimis for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the settlement delay will reduce reported cross-border growth by 1 point. Turning now to financial results, net revenue growth of 13% was significantly stronger than expected. As a reminder we have reached apples-to-apples revenue growth comparisons for Europe, Costco and USAA. Service revenue grew 13% with strong performance in the U.S., slower China dual branded card runoff and some recent renewals performing better than expected. International revenue increased 19% with accelerating cross-border growth particularly inbound to the U.S. as well as favorable exchange rate shifts. Data processing growth of 15% benefited from a higher proportion of cross-border transactions and the overall strength in U.S. payments volume. Client incentives were lower than we expected this quarter at 20.3% of gross revenue. Contract signing delays in Europe are the primary reason. This translates to an additional $0.02 of EPS in the quarter which we expect will be offset due to higher client incentive in the third quarter. Compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2017, however, client incentives are up 25% as many of the contract conversions in Europe were completed during the second half of fiscal 2017. Our Europe contract restructuring initiative is complete. Deal terms have been agreed with all clients and we expect the remaining contracts to be signed in the third quarter. This was a large and complex initiative that is executed very well by our team in Europe. We are pleased with the results relative to the expectations we had at the time of the Visa Europe acquisition. We look forward to building upon the client partnerships that we have solidified through the contract conversion process. On \u2013 as reported on a GAAP basis, operating expenses grew 4%. As a reminder, the second quarter of last year included a non-recurring contribution to the Visa Foundation related to the reorganization of Visa Europe and other Visa subsidiaries. This charitable donation was recorded in general and administrative expenses. Adjusted to exclude this special item from the second quarter of fiscal 2017, operating expenses grew 17.6%, primarily driven by personnel costs and marketing. The second quarter of the last fiscal year was the low point in our head count post the global restructuring, including the reductions in Europe. The year-over-year increase reflects the investment in personnel we have made since then directed at our key growth initiatives. In addition, this quarter included the increase in our 401(k) matching contribution for U.S. employees and higher employee incentive accruals tied to better than expected year-to-date performance. We stepped up marketing investments for the Winter Olympics and in preparation for the FIFA World Cup, which kicks off during the third quarter. Professional fees reflect increased investment to accelerate strategic initiatives in Europe and the deployment of Visa Direct. Growth in network and processing expenses included Europe integration costs. Amortization related to acquisition, CardinalCommerce in February of fiscal 2017, and Fraedom, which closed March this year, contributed to higher D&A expenses. Finally, exchange rate shifts, particularly the stronger pound, added 1 percentage point to expense growth. Non-operating expense was $13 million higher than the second quarter of last year, driven by new debt issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%. This includes a 6 percentage point reduction related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from the successful resolution of a state tax initiative I mentioned earlier. With that, I'll move to our outlook for fiscal 2018. Given stronger than expected growth in the first half, we now expect full year net revenue growth in the low double digits on a nominal dollar basis. This includes approximately 1 percentage point of positive foreign currency impact. Given that the weakening of the dollar accelerated starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the exchange rate tailwind moderates in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. We're narrowing the range for incentives as a percent of gross revenue to 21.5% to 22%. We expect incentives paid to be higher than prior expectation since our volume growth is better. However, our incentive as a percentage of gross revenues are now expected to be in the lower half of our original outlook range since gross revenue will be higher. Third quarter client incentive growth will be higher than prior expectation due to the delay of some contract signings in Europe. Full year operating expense growth is forecast to be in the low double-digits, adjusted for special items in fiscal 2017. The increase in expense growth is driven by larger marketing investments, the acquisition of Fraedom, and higher employee incentive accrual related to better-than-expected performance. We anticipate an additional 1 point of foreign currency impact, primarily due to the strengthening of the pound. Given the FIFA World Cup and some seasonality in personnel costs in the third quarter, coupled with the ramp-up of investment initiative, we expect double-digit expense growth to continue in the third quarter. Expense growth should moderate to the mid-single-digit range by the fourth quarter. Our tax rate, including the impact of U.S. tax reform, is expected to be between 21% and 22%. This reflects the lower tax rate realized year-to-date. Bringing all this together, we now expect EPS growth in the low-60s on a GAAP nominal dollar basis and the high-20s on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis. This includes 1.5 percentage points of positive foreign currency impact and a 9 to 10 percentage point benefit from the impact of U.S. tax reform. As a reminder, we will adopt the new revenue recognition standard at the beginning of fiscal 2019. If applied to second quarter fiscal 2018 reported results, the impact of the new standard would have been small. The impact to fiscal 2019 is partially dependent on the terms of new incentive deals executed and will, therefore, vary. We will continue to assess the impact of the new standard throughout this fiscal year and provide an update if we believe that the application of the new standard to new deals in aggregate could have a more significant impact on reported results. As a reminder, the new accounting standard has no impact on cash flows or the economic value of our business. Finally, let me add my welcome to Mike Milotich in his new role as our Head of Investor Relations. I worked closely with Mike since I joined Visa and believe he'll be a valuable resource for all of you. Mike has a deep understanding of the strategic and financial aspects of our business. You will find Mike a pleasure to work with. I look forward to introducing Mike to you all over the coming weeks. With that, I'll turn this back to him.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Thanks, Vasant. We are now ready to take questions, Katie.\nOperator: Our first question today comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks and good evening. I had a question around pricing and the demand environment in Europe in particular. There seems to be some suggestions, I think, in the market that scheme fees on acquirers are rising pretty quickly and have been so for the past couple quarters. And I'm just wondering is there a dynamic that you guys have been able to take advantage of recently? And then secondly, on the clearing and settlement, that sounds good that you guys are done there. Once you get authorization migrated, is there a meaningful opportunity from a product perspective that we should be thinking through? Thank you.\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: Well, first of all, Dan, on the pricing front, when we first made the acquisition of Visa Europe, we took some pricing. We've subsequently taken some pricing. And as I look out, I think there's pricing opportunities. I'm talking about Europe now, pricing opportunities in Europe looking forward as well. In terms of the migration, I think once we get through \u2013 I mean, first of all, once we get through, one of the biggest benefits that is going to be available is that VisaNet being a global system and with us having four data centers around the world, we're going to be able to ensure real fallback for our clients and for our business in Europe. Prior, it was one system running in one data center. So that's one big advantage that we will have in terms of backup and security. And I think beyond that, there's going to be opportunities in some of our risk tools and in loyalty for sure, where we'll be able to offer new and different capabilities to clients in Europe that they wouldn't have had on the old legacy system.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nDonald J. Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, Al. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of how you came to the thought process on the shared single button digital wallet approach. I know you've been working on Visa Checkout for a while. And can you talk a little bit about how it will work from a logistics standpoint?\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: All right. Well, first of all, Don, this is something that the EMVCo standards body actually developed, of which we're a participant. We actually believe that the \u2013 we're very excited about this. I think that \u2013 I think I talked to some of you about this in the past. I think that there's way too much clutter in the e-commerce checkout environment. And it's just not good for users, and it's not good for merchants. It creates too much friction. There's consumers who don't know what to do. And after they actually make a decision to buy, it's too confusing for them and they fall out of the buying process. And that's just lost business for everybody in the ecosystem. So because of the simplicity, because of the security and because of what we think is going to be a much better user experience, Don, we're very excited about it. We're committed to it and are doing everything we can to move forward to make it a reality. Well, we've been committed to Visa Checkout. We'll remain committed to Visa Checkout, especially in certain geographies and in \u2013 for certain merchants where they see value. But I think the ultimate future as I see it in e-commerce, and it will take time to bleed it in throughout the entire ecosystem, is a move to this EMVCo standard, which creates a single button, which is much more analogous to the situation that you see in the physical world where there's a single terminal and all products run through that terminal. In essence, we've had in the e-commerce world a moral equivalent of multiple terminals, if you will. And I think that's just terrible. It's lousy for the merchants. It's a bad experience for consumers. So, we're excited about this Secure Remote Commerce framework and standard that EMVCo has come up with.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wonder, Al, if you can kind of frame-up the opportunity as you see it in China and India in particular, obviously big, well-highlighted, cash-centric markets. And wonder if you can just give us a sense of Visa's strategy. I know China has been particularly challenging but to address may be India. And what kind of timeline you think there is for sort of material contribution from potential electronic payments growth there.\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: Andrew, let me start with China. I mean, we continue to be very excited about China. We have an application into become a international payment provider in China, and we're hoping that the People's Bank of China and the Chinese government look favorably upon our application, and we can begin the process of moving toward being ready in cooperation with the government in China to be a domestic player. In the meantime we're continuing to work with our over 50 bank partners in China to continue try to grow our coverage in China as well as obviously facilitate as much cross-border volume from traveling Chinese as they leave the borders of China. In the case of India, India is in a different place because we are very pleased with where things are in India. And India, post demonetization, has really attracted huge interest, so. And that makes sense because the cash displacement opportunity is really great there. The reality is we're the market leader. We've got over 50% share in credit and debit and we've continued to grow in 2018 despite the fact that we're growing over some huge numbers that were related to demonetization in 2017. We're really working with the Indian government on the Bharat QR code and scaling that. I think we're up in somewhere in the area of 450,000 merchants that are enabled for this standard QR code. We're growing overall acceptance. We've doubled from the fourth quarter of 2016. We've doubled the number of POS terminals by the end of last year to 3 million. We're continuing to partner with our issuers there in terms of building awareness and usage and we're also \u2013 we're partnering with clients there on digital solutions, tokenization, contactless, scan and pay. So, I see China as something we're excited about but something that's probably still a couple years away in terms of us being a player there and being able to start to produce any kind of volumes never mind meaningful volumes. But India I see as a long-term play. They're a country of nearly 1.4 billion people and I think we've barely scratched the surface in terms of the opportunity as kind of as big as the numbers feel from a relatively close to a standing start. I think that it's an exciting opportunity for the industry. And as the market leader in India, we see it as a very exciting opportunity for us.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nRyan Cary - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: This is Ryan Cary on for Jason. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping to dive a little deeper into the international growth in the quarter, which came in well ahead of what we were modeling. Is there anything worth calling out that surprised you to the upside? And it looks like the spread between volume growth and revenue growth also widened pretty materially. I'm assuming there were some benefit from FX in there but was there any pricing benefits in the quarter? Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Yeah, yeah, several things in there so I'll take them one by one Jason if I can get to them.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Ryan.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: ...or Ryan, sorry. Sorry about that, Ryan. I guess Jason is elsewhere today. So why was it better than \u2013 it was better than we expected. Coming into the year, as you know our inbound business to the U.S. has been a weak business for several years because the dollar was strong. And coming into the year, we hoped that with the weakening of the dollar, there would be some improvement in that business. And we projected a step-up in the growth rate. We were pretty much in line with our expectations in the first quarter but the acceleration continued pretty fast into the second quarter. And in many ways the inbound business to the U.S. has grown faster than we expected. So the recovery has been \u2013 come in earlier than we might have projected. That's one reason. The other reason is the outbound business from Europe, business that is leaving the EU in total, also grew in the double digits for the opposite reason because the euro and the pound are now stronger. Those two clearly were much stronger than we expected and they're very important corridors for us. The revenue impact is greater because the mix of business is better. Because the inbound business to the U.S. for us is an attractive business, and the mix of our cross-border business suddenly got better. There was no pricing that was any \u2013 new or different than anything that was in place prior to coming into the quarter. Certainly, exchange rates were a little better, so that certainly helped that line more than other lines. And then overall, I mean, adding to these two corridors, the cross-border business, because of strong global economy has been strong just about everywhere in the world.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. So, thanks for taking the question, good quarter. My question was with regard to debit volume growth in the U.S. If you could break down what's driving this increased macro or in the spend trend any particular wins to call out? And also just to clarify, is Visa Direct classified here?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Yes. So the debit growth was clearly very strong. And at this point, as we told you earlier, it's not benefiting from any conversion type benefit. This is real apples-to-apples growth and, therefore, quite heartening to see it as strong as it was. As we've dug into it, it was pretty broad-based. We're seeing growth, as I mentioned in my comments, across many segments of retail and across all the everyday spend categories. We essentially attest it to a pretty strong consumer profile in terms of propensity to spend. As a business shifts more to e-commerce, that clearly, also helps in many ways. And then as far as overall sort of the underlying sort of mix of business, that also remains very good. So all in all, just about every aspect of the debit business looked very good this quarter.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks so much. Good results. I guess, I wanted to follow-up on a couple of the questions on international and whatnot. I'm curious, Al, in your travels, has the nationalism sort of theme being settled (46:19)? I know you're making a push towards localizing a lot of the business. I heard your answers around China and in India. But just bigger picture, I'm curious if the whole nationalism sort of pendulum has shifted in any way in your mind?\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: Tien-Tsin, in the last five weeks, I've done a trip to Korea, I've done a trip to China, and I've done our trip to the Middle East and Northern Africa. I still see quite a strong nationalism theme. I think from my perspective, which I've said before, this business, this payments business is a very local business. So clearly on one hand, the solution set that we need to go to market with our issuer clients and our merchant clients is different market by market, and that's a positive thing. And we recognize that and we're putting more resources as we add personnel, adding more people out in the actual countries because that's where the action is. The negative or the watch out of nationalism is what happens in terms of regulation and domestic processing. And does that grow around the world? And what are the rules as it grows? There's domestic processing in a number of markets, some of them it's a very fair playing field where the government is not mandating that you must process on a local processor but it's yet just another option. In a couple of countries, it's not quite an even playing field and we continue to push and work with those governments to try to get it there. So that's what I'd say I was seeing, Tien-Tsin.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMoshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. I was wondering whether you would talk a little bit about whether you're thinking about any sorts of incentives whether it's a carrot or stick type incentives to kind of encourage the move towards that single pay button. And just as a related thing, since you did link in the discussion with PayPal to Visa Direct, is have you ever given any kind of metrics on the size or growth rate of that channel for you?\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: Hi, Moshe, it's Al. We're in the top of the first inning here on the Secure Remote Commerce and the single pay button. We're just getting familiar with the standards from EMVCo and trying to understand exactly what we have to do and what merchants have to do in order to make it a reality in the marketplace. I think that our kind of immediate focus is to get very familiar with the technical aspects of what needs to happen in terms of getting it set up. My personal belief, and we'll have to see how this plays out, is that this is going to come as a really, really positive news for both consumers and merchants. And I think that if done correctly, which we hope that it is, that adoption is going to \u2013 the curve of adoption is going to be quite quick. That said, there have been cases in the past where to accelerate progress we have thought about and used incentives, but we're nowhere near being able to make a decision on that at this point. And I'm hoping we don't because I'm hoping that it's such a very clear improvement in the user experience and the friction, it goes out of the system that people will adopt very, very quickly. In terms of your second question, which I think was around volumes related to PayPal and Visa Direct. We haven't provided any color on that as of this moment. I would say that we're pleased with the way adoption of Visa Direct is continuing. As I said in my remarks, right now, there's a few use cases that we're focused on. And we're pleased with those use cases and we're trying to increase in essence the distribution of those use cases over time. We're hoping to actually look to add further use cases, which will further expand the universe of places where Visa Direct can be used. So I think there's a tremendous amount of upside relative to Visa Direct as we look out over the next couple of years.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Vasant, you talked about sort of the stronger economy driving some of the more robust trends. I was wondering, in the U.S., was any of it discernible from tax reform? Like have you guys seen any impact as it relates to tax reform? And then on the shared button comment, as far as costs are concerned, are there any cost savings as a result of not having to go full force with Visa Checkout? Or are there other costs that we have to contemplate, given the new initiative? Thanks.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Right. In terms of are we seeing any impact from tax reform on consumer spending, I would have to say that it's hard for us to isolate those kinds of impacts. So I don't think we have a point of view on that, and it's probably a little too early in any case. So I'm not sure I can tell you anything specific on that front. As it relates to the button, as Al said earlier, many of these questions are relatively premature given where we are. In terms of Visa Checkout, we remain as focused on it as we were. We will use Visa Checkout in those parts of the world where it clearly is a valuable option for people, especially outside the U.S. In the U.S., there are merchants who would see value in it. We would definitely use Visa Checkout as a solution there. Once this single button solution is available, then we'll just have to see how that plays between the Visa Checkout option and the single button. In the meantime, we will have to spend some money to develop the single button option from a technology standpoint and all that.\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: I think, Sanjay, it goes back a bit to Moshe's question as well. Look, if this gets \u2013 if the pace of adoption is quick, then the reality is that \u2013 and we don't have to either do incentives or do big advertising to promote it. Obviously, that's a good thing. In the case of Visa Direct, we obviously have spent quite a bit of money in promoting it and pushing it. That's why we've gotten over 30 million users of Visa Direct. But I think it remains to be seen until we play this out a little bit more over time as we become more familiar with what's going on, based on the data we're seeing, we'll certainly give more color and commentary on it. But it's just \u2013 it really is early.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.\nJames Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi, thank you. We recently saw a bulletin saying that MasterCard had increased its assessment fees on payment volumes. So I was just wondering what your general thoughts were on the trajectory of Visa's pricing going forward, particularly in the U.S.?\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: Well, we generally don't talk a lot about what our pricing plans are. We obviously look \u2013 we have a dedicated pricing team. We look at pricing on everything that we do from the pricing to issuers, the pricing to acquirers, the services that we make available to our issuer and merchant customers, and we look at the price value equation, we look at the competitive set, and we make judgments on an ongoing basis. And I think that's the most I'd say about it.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and welcome, Mike. I just want to ask a question for you, Al. You talked quite a bit about contactless payments and adoption rates across the globe. Can you maybe just give us a sense about the details of your plans around the U.S.? You talked about some enablement for on the merchant side. But what are you doing to get that stronger on the bank issuer side? Any plans you can articulate there? And then maybe share with us your expectations, say, maybe two years out about what the penetration rate could be or look like in the U.S.?\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: Well, Jim, I think the U.S. market \u2013 I think I've talked about this before but maybe I haven't. The U.S. market is a bit different. It's a little upside down in terms of how this opportunity has \u2013 presents itself. Usually, around the world, the issuer side of the equation has been ahead, and we've had to kind of pull the merchant community along, which I actually think is the harder lift. In the U.S., we kind of got the opposite situation, where we've got nearly 60% of the top 100 enabled. We've got virtually all the terminals being shipped today are enabled for contactless. The whole transit system push, which is happening at a fairly large clip in terms of interest is a stimulant. So in our case, in the U.S., the reality is that we need to catch up on the issuer side, and that's a smaller constituent group versus millions and millions of merchants. So we're in lots of discussions with our issuer partners. And I think that there's a lot of interest on the part of our issuer partners to move to contactless. Nobody's too anxious to do a mass card replacement, but I think as cards start to get replaced, you'll start to see more contactless evolve. That said, as I said in my remarks, this is at least a year or two to get this off the ground before you start to get the beginnings of movement. And then if the U.S. is like other markets, which I have no reason to believe it won't be, I think that, we'll \u2013 in a couple of years, we'll \u2013 if we're in the single-digit that we'll start to see real acceleration then over the next couple of years. And I'm hoping maybe because it's really \u2013 progress is more going to be driven by issuer side movement that maybe the adoption could \u2013 curve could be actually a little bit quicker than we've seen in some of the international market. But that said, I'm not going to get into predicting this right now as to exactly what level of penetration it would be in a couple of years. But I could tell you this, we're excited about it and we're pushing on it.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: Last question, Katie.\nOperator: Our final question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nVasu Govil - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. This is Vasu Govil for James Faucette. Just two really quick ones. One on Visa Direct, you guys talked about a lot of traction there. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what geographies you were seeing more traction in? Is it mostly in the U.S. or what international geographies you're seeing more traction? And then from a P&L perspective, where are these volumes and revenues getting captured? And then quickly on \u2013 just following up on the nationalism question before, recently, I think the Central Bank in India is considering some regulation that all user data needs to be stored only in the country. So, what would that mean for Visa in terms of your ability to process transactions there? Thank you.\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: Okay. So I think there were three questions there.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Visa Direct.\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: So Visa Direct is a product running on VisaNet. So, it is a true global offering. I mean, it \u2013 because VisaNet is global, Visa Direct is global and it's operating in a large number of markets around the world, including Europe, now that we've got VisaNet starting to run in Europe. So I mentioned in the remarks that today probably P2P remains one of the bigger use cases for Visa Direct, but there are other disbursement use cases that we're looking at and are coming onstream that are also producing volumes on Visa Direct. I think your second question was where is it captured?\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Where do we see most of the volume?\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: It's payments volume, right? And some of it is \u2013 it's mostly domestic, but there are some cross-border, so it's mostly showing up in service fees and data processing.\nVasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.: Right and the U.S. certainly is among the better developed markets. You were asking the question from a geography standpoint, and we're starting to see volume in Europe and other parts of the world. And as we've told you, our goal is to have 1.7 billion or so debit credentials enabled by the end of this calendar year on a global basis going all the way to 2 billion. And then there was one\nAlfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.: And then the last question on India. Yes, the RBI, the Central Bank of India has issued in the last 10 days or so a data localization rule. We're still get \u2013 starting to get \u2013 trying to get our hands around them and understand what it means. They're looking for some form of adoption in six months, which is a tough timeframe. So it's early, again, very early there. We're in almost daily discussions with our tech team, with the government in India, with the RBI in India to try to get a sense of what are they really trying to accomplish and what might be the best way to get there. So, again, more to come as we continue our dialogue with the folks in India.\nMike Milotich - Visa, Inc.: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions please feel free to call or e-mail. Thanks again and have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAlfred Kelly: Joon, thank you, and good afternoon to everybody and thanks for joining us today. As always, Vasant and I are going to make some relatively brief comments on our results and then we'll open up to whatever questions you have on your minds. We're off to a solid start in our fiscal year and I'm pleased with our company's performance this past quarter. Our performance was driven by healthy economies around the world, growth and acceptance in the continue rise and E&M commerce, especially in developed countries. U.S. tax reforms certainly has and will continue to impact our business in positive ways. We have made a few initial decisions about our investments as a direct result of the lower corporate tax rate and we continue to talk about it, analyze additional incremental spending options to both, to our talent, our business, and the communities in which we work; all with the goal of fulfilling our corporate mission of helping individuals, businesses and economies thrive. Looking at our business drivers, payments volume grew 10% on a constant dollar basis as we saw healthy growth around the globe. The Central Europe, Middle East region led the way with 19% growth driven by the Gulf countries of the Middle East. Latin America was up 14% with particular strength coming from Argentina, Canada grew 11%, up 4% sequentially resulting from high gas prices and increased spending in retail and telecom. In the United States payments volume grew 10% driven by increases in consumer credit and holiday spending which I'll spend a few minutes on a bit later. Europe maintained a solid growth rate of 9% with strength coming from Turkey and Southeast Europe, and Asia Pacific grew 8% as we saw improved volumes from Australia and Taiwan. And although we're partially lapping that demand utilization in India, total process transactions continue to grow at double-digit rate of 12%. Turning to the financial metrics, net revenue grew 9% driven in part by strong holiday season and accelerating ecommerce growth. We saw good momentum in our cross-border business with revenue growth of 12% in constant dollar, volume growth of 9%. Despite the lapping of Brexit and a stronger currency dynamic, the European cross-border business performed better than we expected. In United States we saw a sequential increase in cross-border growth resulting from increased inbound activity as the dollar remained relatively weak throughout the quarter and the weak dollar trend has continued into the first few weeks of this quarter. Client incentives were 21.4% of gross revenue, roughly in line with the prior quarter. As we discussed in the last call, we're making significant investments in our business initiatives and our strategic priorities leading to increased expense levels in the quarter. And with the new U.S. tax reform in place, a portion of the benefit is reflected in our fiscal first quarter results, this will led to adjusted EPS growth of 26% which includes the benefits from tax reform. Vasant will go into greater detail in the impact of tax reform and provide more background on the numbers. Now let me provide some more color on the subject of U.S. holiday spending. The 2017 holiday season was stronger than the prior year as both consumer credit and debit grew at higher levels. Growth was driven by better performance in retail and entertainment which includes movies, gaming, fitness, sporting goods, recreational activities. Additionally, higher gas prices contributed to some of the growth. Both offline and online volume had higher growth rates than the prior year with online growing approximately four times faster than offline. During the holiday season, ecommerce continued to gain share jumping to over 30% of consumer U.S. holiday volume. Ecommerce growth was strong across a number of categories but was more significantly strengthened by retail performance. Interestingly, the retail spending was stronger earlier in the holiday season, the couple of weeks prior to Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving week looked quite a bit stronger than the growth we saw in the prior year. Beyond the U.S. when we look at some of the other markets and their holiday seasons, growth was better than last year in Brazil, Australia and Canada, that was essentially flat in the United Kingdom. Turning to our business activity, we had another business quarter for announcements; we are very pleased to expand our global leadership position in the co-brand arena with the launches of the Starbucks and Uber programs. Additionally, we renewed our strong and long-term partnership with Marriott. Additionally, we had a good pipeline of renewals across the world. We also advanced our digital products, most notably; we announced the part issue with Facebook in October as they joined our Visa digital enablement program to use our token service to accelerate payment services on the digital properties. With this partnership Visa clients used on Facebook Messenger who now be tokenized and therefore the account numbers are not exposed. This partnership furthers our efforts to encrypt and devalue payment information in the payments ecosystem. Additionally, this partnership advances our effort to enable and develop new digital commerce experiences as consumers spend more time in messaging environments like Facebook. In November we launched Visa Direct in Europe which provides real time push payment solutions for person to person, business to business and business to consumer applications leveraging our global network. The advantage of Visa Direct is that it utilizes our existing network connections, rules, operations and key controls that are built into the network such as transaction limits and sanctions screening. Because of this tactical and operational leverage, the time and cost of implementation is lower than many alternative options. As we stated previously, we believe that Visa Direct is a key product to enable fast payments across Europe. More recently, we initiated a small pilot for new biometric cards for contactless payments which provides an alternative to pin or signature authentication. This is the first commercial pilot to test an on-card biometric for contactless payments. We're committed to ensuring secure, fast and convenient payments at the point of sale. And core to delivering on this commitment is to continually evolve the marketplace in terms of dynamic authentication methods such as EMV chip and an indication of these pilots investing in emerging capabilities that leverage biometrics. As we stated before, we always want to make strategic investments that will drive long-term growth for our business, with that objective we're making investments in the area of contactless transactions and authentication methods as this is the natural evolution following the adoption of the EMV infrastructure. Consumer research and internal data has shown that there is a strong interest for contactless payments as it creates a faster and more convenient experience at the point of sale. We've seen significant adoption in markets like Australia, UK and Canada and we hope to increase adoption in other markets. We're especially excited about the U.S. market given the build out of the EMV infrastructure that will allow us to go with the market forward and towards contactless transactions. Echoing my earlier remarks, the recent tax reform will create benefits and opportunities for our business. We're exploring the range of options and we're prioritizing long-term sustainable investments versus one-time actions. One of the areas we're most focused on is our employees and talent development as this is the foundation of our business. As the first step we enhanced our benefits for U.S. based employees and increased our company contribution to the U.S. 401(k) program given the importance of retirement planning. This allows U.S. employees to enjoy a sustained benefit consisted with the ongoing contribution that they make every day to build our business for our clients, partners and shareholders. Additionally, we're exploring other global benefits and investments for our business around the world. Throughout the year we will continue to make strategic investments in our people and the areas of digital products, technology operations and merchant solutions as we position the company for long-term sustainable growth. Additionally, in light of tax reform, the board increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.21 per share, ultimately using funds to grow our business organically however is the top objective for our capital allocation here at Visa. Last year we evolved our global social impact strategy and announced the formation of the Visa Foundation. Funds available through the foundation will help drive real progress across the world with a primary focus on helping micro and small enterprises thrive through access, growth and resilience. I'm pleased to say that the foundation made an inaugural grab to this past quarter to the Women's World Banking; this grant will help support the millions of women-led small and micro enterprises which are underserved financially around the world. Let me spend a few minutes on the international front. In Europe we are making good progress on our ongoing integration efforts and identifying areas for growth. We're working closely with our clients as we've now resolved over 80% of the contracts moving to commercial incentives. In terms of the tactical integration we expect Visa net migration to begin this quarter and continue throughout 2018. We have planned carefully with our clients to ensure the highest standards of preparation and testing for the months leading upto the migration with regular update with the business leaders to ensure a smooth and stable migration. Once the migration is completed, we'll be able to deliver new products, services and capabilities to the region bringing the best of our global capabilities to our European clients. As I mentioned on the last call, I was going to spend additional time with the European leadership team in planning and strategy meetings this past quarter. Having spent 3 of the last 6 weeks in Europe, it reinforced my belief that there is still meaningful growth opportunities in the region. Few remarks about India; we have a market leading position in debit and credit with significant share in both categories. After partially lapping the impact of demonetization, we saw domestic payments volume grow over 20% and process transactions grow 12% in the past quarter. We continue to engage with the regulators, the government and our clients to ensure sustainability of the economics and we are investing and partnering with issuers, acquirers and the government to grow electronic payments. We have crossed 3 million acceptance points and are working to scale up contact list and broad QR usage and acceptance points. As we look at our capital allocation plans, our top priority as I said earlier continues to be investing for the future growth of our business to deliver shareholder value. In addition though, we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. In fiscal Q1 we returned $2.2 billion of capital consisting of $1.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly $460 million in dividends. As I stated on our last call, we expect to return over $9 billion of capital to shareholders this fiscal year. I already talked about the dividend increase to $0.21 per share; the Board on Tuesday also authorized an additional $7.5 billion share repurchase program resulting in a current authorization level of $9.1 billion. In closing, we're off to a solid start to our fiscal year. I'm pleased with our consistent business execution and excited about the many growth prospects we had. And with that, let me turn it over to Vasant who will cover some of the financial details.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. We had a solid start to fiscal year '18 with GAAP EPS growth of 25% and adjusted EPS growth of 26%. Implementation of the tax cuts and jobs act added approximately 9 percentage points to this adjusted growth rate which I will discuss in more detail in few minutes. Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform, EPS growth was 17%. Net revenue growth was 9%. Growth of key business drivers, payments volume, cross model volume and process transactions remained strong and stable across the globe. As a reminder, several significant factors have a meaningful impact on year-over-year revenue growth comparisons this quarter. First, and by far the most significant factor, rebates to Visa Europe members ended beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year '17, so this is the first quarter of apples-to-apples revenue growth comparisons for Europe. This affects reported service fees, data processing and international revenue. We are also at apples-to-apples growth comparisons for Costco and USAA credit. The India demonetization impact started in November 2016, so we partially lapped that in Q1 and finally, fiscal year '18 price increases which are smaller in scope than fiscal year '17 increases will go into effect in the second half of the year. In fiscal year '17 our U.S. price increase went into effect in the first quarter and international increases went into effect mostly in the second quarter. A few other items of note; we bought back 15.5 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $110.67 or $1.72 billion this quarter. Our board has authorized a new $7.5 billion share repurchase program, including this additional authorization we now have $9.1 million available for share repurchases. In addition, our board has increased the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share at almost 8% increase commensurate with higher earnings potential of the company post tax reform. This is in addition to the 18% increase in the dividend last quarter. Finally, in October 2017 we used the proceeds from our September debt offering to redeem the $1.75 billion of senior notes scheduled to mature in December 2017. A quick review of the key business drivers in the fiscal first quarter; payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 10%, even the growth from Costco and USAA credit on an apples-to-apples basis, U.S. growth accelerated one point increasing from 9% in the fourth quarter to 10% in the first quarter; this reflects solid underlying growth from a strong holiday season, particularly in the credit business. Credit was up 11%, debit was up 8%, adjusted for conversions, underlying growth rates for both credit and debit stepped up. As Al described, we saw higher growth in consumer payments volume this holiday season driven by acceleration in retail and entertainment spending, especially online, as well as rising gas prices. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was stable at 10%. Growth rate stepped up in Canada, Australia, across Latin America and the Middle East. The rate of decline in Chinese dual branded card volumes slowed, this was offset to some extent by the impact of lapping India demonetization. Cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 9%, this is one point lower than the fourth quarter of fiscal '17, primarily due to the drag from an ecommerce payments platform shifting acquiring of UK cardholder volume to the UK from another EU location. The total impact of the shift that we first mentioned in July is greater than 3 point reduction in our reported cross-border constant dollar growth rate. This shift is only a minor effect on revenue since it is an intra-EU move the platform made to optimize its European business. U.S. outbound spend also slowed moderately as the dollar weakened. As we expected, growth of inbound commerce into the U.S. picked up at the weakening dollar. Inbound commerce into Europe remained robust but growth slowed as we lacked the weakening of both, the pound and euro after the Brexit vote. Growth in outbound spend from the Caribbean has returned to more typical levels after the hurricanes. However, inbound spend remains weak as travellers choose other destination while many of the islands recover. Process transaction growth of 12% is down one percentage point versus last quarter, largely driven by partially lapping India demonetization. Through January 28, constant dollar U.S. payments values growth was 9%, U.S. credit growing 10% and debit 8%. Cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis was up 11%, process transactions grew 11%. A brief review of fiscal first quarter financial results; net revenue grew 9%. As I mentioned earlier, net revenue growth deceleration versus the prior quarter is driven by several significant factors, particularly the removal of European rebates. Exchange rate shifts helped Q1 net revenue growth by around one point. Incentives as a percent of growth revenues at 21.4% added a lower end of our outlook range this quarter but up 2.5 percentage point from last year as Europe contract conversion and other renewals during the second half of fiscal year '17 impact us in fiscal year '18. We expect to see an uptick in incentives as the percentage of growth revenues in the remaining quarters based on the timing of renewals. We're on-track to complete conversion of contracts in Europe from rebates to incentives by the end of the second quarter. Operating expenses grew 13%, primarily driven by personnel costs. As a reminder, personnel expenses were low in the first quarter of fiscal year '17 and ramped up through the year. We have some expenses that are first half loaded including the Winter Olympics in the second quarter as well as Europe integration costs as we complete the technology platform harmonization and start client migrations. Our spend rate on investment initiative is higher in the first half of fiscal year '18 than they were during the first half last year since we ramped up many of these investments during the second half of fiscal year '17. In addition, the first quarter of fiscal year '18 operating expenses were higher than we expected due to some timing shifts and some non-recurring items. Non-operating expenses were lower than expected due to higher interest income on our cash balances, as well as a gain on the sale of an investment. Our tax rate for the quarter on a GAAP basis was 22.1%, this included two special items related to the implementation of U.S. tax reform. First, we had 1.13 billion onetime non-cash tax benefit from re-measuring our net deferred tax liabilities based on the new corporate tax rate. Second, we had an offsetting 1.15 billion charge related to the transition tax. In moving to the new territorial system, the tax [ph] requires a transition tax on previously untaxed deferred foreign income; this tax which is payable over 8 years is 15.5% on the amounts held in cash and cash equivalents and 8% on the remaining non-cash amount. These two items are estimated based on the information available to us at this time and maybe adjusted over the year as we analyze additional information and guidance. Adjusted to exclude these two items, our effective tax rate was 21.7%. Both, the GAAP and adjusted tax rate was 6 percentage points lower because of the lower corporate tax rate. Implementation of the tax act added $0.07 to our GAAP EPS and $0.08 to our adjusted EPS in the first quarter. This translates to 9 percentage points of additional EPS growth. Exchange rate shifts added one point to reported EPS growth. With that, I'll move to our updated outlook. We are revising our fiscal year '18 outlook for the impact of U.S. tax reform. Let me briefly start with what is not changing. Annual net revenue growth is still expected to be in the high single-digits on nominal dollar basis. This includes one half to one percentage point of positive foreign currency impact. The impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese Yen, the Brazilian Real and the Mexican Peso is offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the euro and the pound. The quarterly cadence of revenue growth remains unchanged versus our prior expectations. Our outlook for the fiscal second quarter net revenue growth remains a couple of points below the full year rate. We also reiterated our outlook for client incentive as a percent of growth revenues in the 21.5% to 22.5% range, an annual operating margin in the high 60s. Now to what is changing; our GAAP and effective tax rate is expected to be 6 points lower or approximately 23% for fiscal year '18. This is driven by the reduction of the U.S. federal tax rate on our U.S. taxable income from 35% to 21%. This benefit from the reduction in the federal tax rate is partially offset by deductions that are no longer available and a lower benefit for state taxes paid. The 6 percentage point reduction of our fiscal year '18 tax rate represents three quarters of the lower U.S. federal tax rate starting January 1, 2018 through the end of our fiscal year in September. The annualized reduction in our tax rate is 8 percentage points. As such, we will have another 2 point reduction in our overall tax rate in fiscal year '19. The tax reduction could be partially offset by new provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act that go into effect in 2019 such as the repeal of Section 199 deduction. The 13.1% floor on global intangible low taxed income, as well as the base erosion and anti-abuse tax. We'll be doing the work to assess the impacts of these provisions over the next few months and update you as we have better estimates. At this point we expect an additional 1 to 2 percentage point reduction in our fiscal year '19 tax rate over and above the 6 percentage point benefit we realized in fiscal year '18 as a result of U.S. tax reform. We plan to reinvest approximately 1 percentage point of pretax earnings in our business and our people. Al mentioned the change we made to our 401(k) matching contributions to U.S. employees. We are evaluating additional investments with a focus on actions that will drive long-term sustainable revenue growth. We anticipate that this additional investment will increase our operating expense growth in fiscal year '18 by approximately 2 percentage points to the high end of mid-single digits adjusted for special items in fiscal year '17. We are still expecting operating expense growth to be higher in the first half and lower during the second half for all of the reasons we discussed previously. Double-digit growth in operating expenses is expected to continue into the second fiscal quarter. The impact of these changes on our EPS outlook for fiscal year '18 is approximately 9 to 10 points. We now expect EPS growth to be at the high end of the mid-20s range on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis. This still includes 1 to 1.5 points of positive foreign currency translation impact. We project adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $10 billion, up $900 million from what we estimated last quarter, this is largely driven by U.S. tax reform. Our quarterly dividend at $0.21 is 27% higher than our fiscal year '17 quarterly dividend. We have over $9 billion available for stock buybacks, we continue to anticipate buying back over $7 billion of Visa stock during fiscal year '18. We ended the quarter with global cash-on-hand including marketable securities of $14.1 billion of which $6.3 billion is currently offshore. During the quarter we returned $1.8 billion of non-U.S. cash back to the U.S. We're working on additional actions to further reduce our offshore cash in fiscal year 2018. As a reminder, we will adopt the new revenue recognition standard on October 1, 2018, the beginning of our fiscal 2019. If applied to the first quarter of fiscal year '18 reported results, the impact of the new standard would have been small. The impact to fiscal year '19 is partially dependent on the terms of new incentive deals executed and will therefore vary. We will continue to assess the impact of the new standard throughout fiscal year '18 and provide an update if we believe that the application of the new standard to new deals in aggregate could have a more significant impact on reported results. As a reminder, the new accounting standard has no impact on cash flows or the economic value of our business. In summary, fiscal year 2018 is off to a strong start underpinned by a healthy global economic environment. The shift away from cash to digital forms of payments remains a powerful secular trend. Europe performance and integration plans remain on-track. Our outlook for operating performance remains unchanged, tax reform in the U.S. will add 9 to 10 points to EPS growth after the additional investments we're planning. We remain committed to our state-owned [ph] hold capital allocation strategies, our Board has raised the quarterly dividend again this quarter to reflect the higher earnings potential of Visa post tax reform, and we have over $9 billion in authorization to fund our stock buyback plans. With that, I will turn this back to Joon.\nJoon Huh: And with that Athena, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from the line of Tenjing [ph] of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: I thought I'd ask on U.S. debit; it looks like growth has settled in pretty nicely actually around 8% the last two quarters. Is this a good clean rate to assume for U.S. debit as we look ahead? And I also wanted to meaning to ask you guys, since your decision too no longer require a signature, a checkout in the U.S.; what's the opportunity there, how does this change the dynamic of pin versus signature and all that good stuff? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.\nAlfred Kelly: On the first question, obviously we're not going to forecast ahead but U.S. debit has been performing quite well and as I said in my remarks, debit as well as credit looked very good in the holiday season. In terms of your second question, the reality is that the vast majority of transactions in United States didn't require a signature anyway because of the number -- especially in debit because the requirements of not having to take signature for under $25 or under $50 transaction. Our decision which -- we took a very thoughtful approach to ended up being at least a little bit different than our competitors where we said that we're going to move to no signature where somebody has set up for EMV. We actually think we need to be continue to encourage adoption of EMV for security reasons and therefore made the requirement that it's no signature as long as your merchant is EMV enabled. And we continue to believe that we've got a good roadmap for debit but I would say these things are unrelated, largely, and the reality is that we think we made a good decision for consumers. I'd also add that I still think there is a place for signature in a number of cases, high ticket items I think -- as we've done a lot of consumer research, consumers want to be able to validate and merchants want to be able to validate that transaction. Also consumers and in situations like keeping [ph] situations where they are adding to the base amount, also prefer to be able to continue to use the signature; so while there is no signature required we do expect that a number of merchants in specific situations will continue to request the signature from consumers and consumers will want to provide that signature.\nOperator: Next question will be from the line of David [ph] of Evercore. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Could you update us on your strategy to expand Visa Europe into some of the higher growth markets where you're less well representative, for example, Nordics, Italy and Germany?\nAlfred Kelly: Well, I've said in my remarks I've been over there 3 of the last 6 weeks and I think that we have largely built out our leadership team and are very far along on the strategy for Europe. And you're absolutely right, David; if you look at our business in Europe, obviously we have very strong position in the UK, in France, we have a good position in Spain but there are 34 other markets in Europe, at least there is we -- as we establish -- how the way we established Europe and there is a lot of opportunity in the markets. You mentioned plus Italy, plus Germany, and we're in the midst of actually staffing up in a number of markets. In terms of personnel, one of my objectives is to ultimately have less people in the regional hub in London and more out in the markets where the action is. But we -- between bringing our digital products into Europe, Visa Direct, Visa Token Services; as well as adding personnel and building our relationship with issuers, Charlotte Hogg, our new European CEO has spent a tremendous amount of time in the four months she has been with the company out talking to our clients throughout Europe. So I actually -- absolutely believe that Europe, particularly on the continent represents great opportunity for us and the beginnings of what will be a journey to build our business to a much stronger position on the continent.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned launched Visa Direct in Europe; could you talk about your broader strategy for PSD2, at Analyst Day you mentioned keeping your options open, potentially buying a PS [ph] -- I'd be curious for what your thoughts are currently?\nAlfred Kelly: I think as we said then and I think we've been consistent, look PSD2 is kind of a long-term play and I think it's going to take a while to see how it's actually going to play out. We actually think we're pretty well positioned as it relates to PSD2 coming into Europe. The strong customer authentication is going to require and put a premium on risk and authorization capabilities which is a strong point of the whole ability to have third-party accessed accounts I think was a premium on -- and outstanding payment experience and that's something that we tried ourselves in working closely what our issues are and this probably new consumer experience is that we'll emerge as a result of the PSD2 legislation and I think -- again, we feel like we're well positioned to work with our issuers partners on it. So I think this is going to be a very slow build overtime but I think we feel like we're well positioned as it relates to this regulation going into place in Europe.\nOperator: Next question will be from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller: Just starting off, I mean it looks like there is a round of billing in dollar benefit from tax reform that you can see over the course of the year just based on the tax rates you're giving us now. I know you talked about some specific items like retirement contributions and investments in growth; I guess a little more specifics on breaking down that dollar amount in terms of your expectation on categories along with the sustainability beyond this year. And then Al, just when you think about market share here, I just love to hear your thoughts on -- if there is a good pipeline of things up for grabs, I mean just looking at one of your biggest competitors, the growth profile of some of their volumetrics were still higher, I'm just curious if it was anything that you see happening or is it just timing factors?\nVasant Prabhu: On the tax one, yes, just too sort of go through it again. The full benefit of the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% on annualized basis is 8 points. We get 6 points this year because we're getting three quarters of benefit. We'll get 2 points from the corporate tax reduction next year, we're just being a little cautious on the two points because of additional provisions that go in next year that we along with others are looking for more guidance on. We have an initial point of view on it but we're assuming it will change through the year. As you know, when you translate that, that is $1 billion after-tax benefit to us in lower cash taxes as a result of that. There are two things -- we can talk about four sort of things around how we want to deploy the cash. One, you've already heard us say that we've already made some decisions that will reinvest about a point of that reduction in taxes, meaning one point of our pretax income in our business in operating expenses, some of which you already heard about, things we're doing for employees, others in terms of adding to some of the investment programs that are already on the way, as well as some new initiatives. That will cause our expenses to grow a little bit more than we had originally anticipated, that expenses are essentially on-track for the year versus prior outlook. We're just with a deliberate strategy increasing it by 2 points as a result of tax reform. The second dimension is commensurate with the higher earnings potential of the company. We are stepping up the dividend, we already have a healthy buyback program with over $7 billion this year, this was reflecting the fact that we were buying back some of the stock issued to Visa Europe owners. Once we get past the $7 billion mark, we need to do more, we will evaluate it at that point. And then finally in terms of M&A and investments, as Al said, our priority is to invest in our business organic growth. The fact the tax rates are lower, certainly improves the ROI you can get on investments and the same on M&A. But we were not cash constraint before, so we're not going to change our posture other than the fact that lower taxes made investments more attractive. So I'm going to turn it back to Al if he wants to add to this and I'm sure he is going to talk about the other question.\nAlfred Kelly: Look, we're not the type of company that can deploy capital organically, extraordinarily quickly but we've got a whole set of key investment areas that are driven off of our strategic pillars and we're going to continue to focus on those things, whether it's security in the ecosystem driving contactless expanding access, digital expansion, those will be the areas we focus on. In relationship to your second question on market share; I would say this, in my mind there is tremendous opportunity to grow in the medium and long-term and I think the opportunity is more. We're growing the market, bringing more people into the payments mainstream, expanding access by displacing cash and cheque. I think we've had a very good quarter, MasterCard had an excellent quarter; to me this isn't a quarter-by-quarter contest, we're driven and focused on sustained long-term growth for our investors overtime and I know it's a point out that I think looking at quarter-by-quarter comparisons can be really tricky, there is a whole bunch of factors that are different between us and some of our competitors, there is business mix differences, there is lapping dynamics, there is timing issues, there is wins and renewals and conversions and frankly, there is differential impact of exchange rates. So I look at it and say, I think medium to long-term opportunities are terrific, I think our fundamentals are very good and we feel good about the long-term prospects of the business.\nOperator: Next question will be from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJames Schneider: Thanks for taking my question, maybe going back to the Europe topic for a second, if you think about your market share position within Europe, across both debit and credit, Al can you maybe opine on where you see opportunities to improve that position in terms of individual countries? And then as you think longer term, do you think that could come at the expense of local processors or more of your traditional peers?\nAlfred Kelly: At this stage, I'm reluctant to get into [Technical Difficulty] A rebate structure and I think it's our expectation that we'll get through almost all of this, there might be a few lag or what gets through all of this by the end of this second quarter.\nVasant Prabhu: And in terms of pricing I think we've told you earlier that there is pricing but this year there is the pricing goes into effect in the second half. And then we'll evaluate further pricing actions in the future.\nOperator: Next question will be from the line of Ramsey [ph] of Jefferies & Company. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Total process transaction growth was really heavy this quarter despite Indian demonetization last year. Can you give us your view on whether the progress made in India in terms of just the general electronification of payment is kind of a permanent inflexion point in that market or do you see the market reverting to cash usage overtime? There seems to be some media report with some consenting -- some kind of conflicting signals there.\nAlfred Kelly: I was doing the baseball analogy; we're still in the first -- maybe the beginning of the second inning in India, there is just a long way to go. I've read some of the same reports but I think we have hit an inflexion point. We've seen a huge increase in acceptance points and volume over the course of the last -- I guess now 14 months. The government is very bullishly behind this and while we're through the demonetization period, there is a little bit more of the cash back in circulation. I think that the government is very desirous of having the efficiencies of more electronic digital transactions, as well as ideally getting past the point where they get rid of the grey economy in India and have more transparency from a tax perspective. So my view -- and obviously, you know, I know what I know which isn't everything and I think it is at inflexion point but while I say it's an inflexion point sometimes that -- we're well into the match racing curve of this, there is inflexion point there, there is a long, long way to go; 3 million merchants and the type of volume that we're add as much as the growth rate to very attractive, it is very small compared to where India will ultimately be.\nVasant Prabhu: And just in terms of metrics, that would -- going to your question about is this permanent, yes, there is a lot more cash in the economy because cash is back to normal but as Al said, the number of acceptance points has doubled and people are not pulling back the government or the banks or all of us are still pressing hard on building acceptance. There are more people using cards, that's a measurable metric and then there is more people using cards with a higher frequency and that's a measureable metric and the real test will be once we fully lap the demonetization, what is still the growth rate and we'll tell you more next quarter.\nOperator: Next question will be from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: I actually also had a question on India and the terminalization of that market. Al, can you give us a little sense of how much the tax related savings might go into helping terminalize that market?\nAlfred Kelly: I don't know that -- first of all, money has become plungable but we're already investing fairly heavily in India, it's one of the markets -- as I look around the world, it's one of our largest markets in terms of deployment of people. And I'm talking about people in the market, I'm not counting the 950 people we have at a technology center in Bangalore. And we were planning to grow our India presence in our plan before tax reform. Look, we've turned back to all of our regional leaders and Vasant and I have been asking people to tell us where they potentially could put money to work in a very smart way that's going to drive growth against the type of areas that we're already investing and in India, certainly one of the main areas of growth is building out acceptance, which might in some cases be physical terminals, in many cases it will be continued use of rolling out QR technology and MVisa apps for consumers. So I think it's safe to assume that India is going to continue to be an area that we're going to look to invest in and it's highly possible but decision not made for sure that we'll -- as a result of facts reform we might put a bit more money into that market.\nOperator: Next question will be from the line of Chris [ph] of Buckingham. Your line is now open.\nAlfred Kelly: Athena, I think we have a bad connection. Can we move to the next question?\nOperator: Next question will be from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJames Faucette: First, I wanted to dig in really quickly -- can you just talk about cross-border and how you're thinking about getting to your expectations, especially since I've seen to decelerate maybe a little bit at least on [indiscernible]? And then more broadly for -- I think Amir [ph] was mentioning that the Analyst meeting a couple of quarters back that you thought that on there could be acceleration and beat this business over the medium term and in part driven by increasing B2B opportunities. I'm wondering looking out at that medium to long run, where we should be looking for those B2B opportunities to emerge and what are some of the things that we should be tracking, I guess similar to the way we're trying to track the acceptance in places like India, etcetera; what kind of things you would be looking at in B2B to look for that potential acceleration? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: On cross-border, just a couple of things to point out; that is in fact an improvement in the rate of January and we think that will sustain based on everything we're seeing. One item that is affecting our reported numbers is the shift in Europe, included in our cross-border numbers as it is for others too is intra-European cross-border volume that is cross-border business within the EU. That's different than typical cross-border volume but does get included in the cross-border volume and you do have people moving -- acquiring within Europe, and so when fairly large account decides to acquire in the UK from a non-UK location, it's a sizeable move in the reported numbers with modest revenue impacts. So if you add that back, I mean the real underlying growth rate was quite a bit higher than the reported growth rate. In terms of trends that help that, as we've said before, one of the best things that can happen to our cross-border business in some respects of the weaker dollar, we have a large U.S. acquired business. The good news is we did see the growth rate in that business step-up but it was from very low levels; so our U.S. acquired business which is a very attractive business is growing faster than it was and will most likely continue to grow faster but it's still growing less than the overall growth rate of the cross-border business. So there is one variable that could accelerate cross-border growth further would be the U.S. acquired business, growing faster and going back to double-digit levels like it has been in the past. Beyond that we'll have to watch what happens as European currency strengthened, clearly it will help the acquiring business in Europe as this becomes more attractive for people or rather the issuing business coming out of Europe as it becomes more attractive for Europeans to travel out. So those are couple of trends that can -- that are both watching.\nAlfred Kelly: And James on the question about B2B; it really is a large opportunity, we are focused on it, we have a senior person and a team focused on B2B, we think that through the use of Visa Direct we can meet the needs of a lot of the small and medium sized merchants and using things like single use virtual cards in larger verticals like healthcare and travel. That said you raised a good question around how we can give you guys a bit more insight to our progress and let me take that away and maybe the next quarter or some point later this year we'll try to give a little bit more insight in terms of things to watch there and how you can evaluate the progress we're making along the way.\nOperator: Next question will be from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJason Kupferberg: I think you mentioned out that during holiday season in the U.S. ecomm was about 30% of volume. Can you give us some broader ecomm metrics globally -- what percentage of global volume, how fast is it growing? And then, I'm just curious to get your quick take on the contactless initiatives in the U.S.; what's the issuer response so far because it sounds like that would create some new expense for them? So I just wanted to get your perspective there. Thanks.\nAlfred Kelly: On the first question, I don't think we're prepared to start giving breakdown on country by country basis on ecommerce versus card -- present type of growth. I think it developed countries that the trends that I talked about in the U.S. are similar in some of the developed countries. Obviously, in less developed countries the mix and the dynamics between the two and different. In terms of contactless, I think in the United States, again -- the pluming is in place to go, we think by the end of the year 50% of the terminals in the U.S. will be contactless enabled on terminal -- virtually every terminal being shipped now is contactless enabled. And I think the U.S. issuers are getting excited about the prospects of the customer experience associated with contactless and I would expect that you're not going to see a massive off-cycle replacement of with NFC -- that are NFC enabled. But I think that you will start to see issuers as they go through their normal card renewal cycles and there is the replaced cards that are lost or stolen, etcetera, that more of those will be replaced with cards that are NFC enabled. So I think this is a multi-year journey but -- again, there will be an inflection point at some point where it will really take off as we reach a certain level of scale and clearly, we're not there yet but I think we're poised to begin the journey.\nOperator: Our last question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan Keane: I just wanted to ask about the operating margins; they were down I think one point year-over-year and looks about one point short of where street was estimating. So just want to think about personnel and G&A costs which were up a lot, does that continue throughout the year and how much did you take advantage of just lower tax reform in the quarter to maybe crank up the expenses which caused a little bit lower margin? And then just a follow-up on Visa Europe; the technology migration going on, will that have a positive benefit to margins in fiscal year '19 as a result of that and just trying to figure out about how much? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: On the expense side, you might recall when we talked to you last quarter about outlook we had indicated that you should expect expense growth to be higher in the first half than the second half; a lot of it has to do with year-over-year comparisons. Personnel expenses were unusually low in the first quarter of last year for a variety of reasons, I won't go into all of them, some will have to do with the consultation process that was under Europe, some had to do with the fact that we had also done the global restructuring coming into the quarter. So personnel expenses were off to a fairly slow start and if you looked at our personal expenses last year they climbed through the year; so this rate of growth in personal expenses you should not see continue beyond the first half. So there are year-over-year comparisons. On the G&A side, as I said there were some non-recurring items and some shifts and expenses that make that number higher than it normally would have been. So we did have a number of expenses in the quarter that were of a non-recurring or timing variety but our original outlook for expenses remains unchanged versus what we told you. We have deliberately chosen to reinvest an additional 2 points in expenses as a result of tax reform. I wouldn't say a lot of that was in this quarter, it was more what we expected based on comparisons plus some of these non-recurring and timing related things.\nAlfred Kelly: On the second question Bryan, I think we have to see how -- we haven't even begun the migration, as I said we're beginning next quarter. I think we're going to have to see how long it takes, we're going to be measured in deliberate and careful about it. We'll get some benefit from it financially once we're all the way there but I think in terms of timing it's a little bit too early to say and I think in terms of mentioning it, I'm not actually sure we have mentioned it; it's all part of having this transaction continue to be accretive at a level above what we thought it would be when we made the acquisition in the first place.\nJoon Huh: And with that, we'd like to thank you all for joining us today. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining everyone.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Mike, thank you and good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter capped another strong year for Visa as we continue to grow our business across a number of dimensions. In our time today, I would like to touch on our results, then discuss how we are strengthening our network with the power of partnerships and a focus on customers and finally provide our initial thoughts on fiscal 2020. To start, our fourth quarter results demonstrate our ability to grow the topline, invest thoughtfully in the business to drive future growth and return capital to shareholders. An important indication relative to the health of our network is transaction growth. In this regard, Q4 ended strongly with over 47 billion payment transactions, an increase of 5.3 billion or 12.6% compared to this quarter last year. Payments volume grew at 9% globally, 10% excluding China. We also saw a strong growth in payments volume across every region and growth accelerated versus the last quarter in every international region. Net revenue growth accelerated to 13% or 15% on a constant dollar basis. Non-GAAP EPS growth was 21% or 23% on a constant dollar basis. We also returned $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the fourth quarter, consisting of $2.2 billion in share repurchases and a $0.5 billion in dividends. Our fourth quarter performance brought our full year net revenue growth to 13% on a constant dollar basis and non-GAAP EPS growth of 20% on a constant dollar basis. Total capital returned for the year was $10.9 billion. As a reflect on all of 2019, Visa has made tremendous progress leading a dynamic industry and advancing the growth of digital payments. This has manifested itself in a variety of fronts. To start, over 180 billion payment transactions leveraged our network in fiscal 2019, of which we processed about 75%. This represented almost $9 trillion in commerce on 3.4 billion credentials, all with the security and protections that our customers value. Relative to growing acceptance, we now have over 61 million physical merchant locations, increasing 14% from 2018. And again, keep in mind that this number is 10s of millions higher as partners like PayPal, Stripe and Square only count as one location each. And new payment flows have crossed the $1 trillion mark for B2B payments volume, representing 12% of our business. We also continue to grow Visa Direct, which supports P2P, B2B and P2C in triple digits with over two billion transactions. And on our capabilities and value-added services, we acquired four companies that will help extend the reach of our network and enhance our merchant fraud and tokenization solutions. Our organic revenue growth driven by these capabilities at all value-added services exceeded 20% this year. This growth was fueled by the expansion of our issuer processing and network services, an increase in our acquirer and merchant offerings including CyberSource, greater adoption of our risk and authentication tools and consulting project work. In fact, we helped more than 1,000 clients grow their businesses by leveraging insights from our consultants and data scientists. Our strategic focus throughout 2019 and going into 2020 is clear, drive deeper partnerships with traditional clients, expand access with new players, including new sellers, fintechs, neobanks, acquirers and wallets, increased customer engagement by enabling a variety of platforms and simplifying the payment experience, extending value-added capabilities across the ecosystem and enabling new money movement with our network of networks. Let me elaborate on these focus areas, starting with driving deeper partnerships with traditional clients. We had significant deals in the pipeline and our efforts have paid off, with us completing agreements in the fourth quarter that represent over 15% of our payment volume. This brings our full year number to about 30% of our global payments volume. This 30% renewal level is substantially higher than our average of the past five years of 20%. Let me highlight a few clients from this quarter. We renewed our partnership with Bank of America in the United States for several years maintaining our current debit and credit business, while also expanding to capture the new issuance of their cash rewards consumer credit card. We are excited to continue to collaborate with Bank of America on innovations such as tap-to-pay and tokenization and utilize data analytics and insights to help uncover growth opportunities. In Central Europe, Middle East and Africa, we had a number of large issuer deals this quarter, including our credit and debit business with Sberbank and Alfa Bank, two of the largest banks in Russia and the debit business with Emirates NBD, one of the largest banks in the UAE. We also renewed the debit portfolio with Standard Chartered Bank across all of sub-Sahara and Africa. In Latin America, we signed a multi-year agreement to renew our long-standing relationship with Scotiabank covering 16 countries and territories across Latin America. In Europe, we are focused on driving growth in the continent of Europe while also deepening our existing partnerships in the U.K. This quarter, we renewed two portfolios with leading U.K. issuers, one in debit and one in commercial credit. In Continental Europe, we renewed our strategic partnership with BBVA in Spain for the next seven years. This agreement will allow Visa and BBVA to grow much faster during this period. Additionally, Ziraat Bank, the largest state-owned bank in Turkey renewed their consumer credit and debit business and we won new issuance of their commercial credit portfolio. Now let me turn to expanding access with new players such as fintechs and wallets, which are critical to expanding credentials and acceptance globally. We established and deepened relationships with several fintech partners across the globe. First, we are pleased that Visa and Europe-based Revolut reached an agreement naming Visa their leading issuing partner as they seek to expand globally. In addition to increasing our share of their large European business, Revolut will leverage Visa's brand, scale and global acceptance footprint to bring its product offerings to five new regions reaching 24 new markets for a total of 56 markets globally. In the United States, we signed an exclusive five-year deal with the consumer debit and credit business with Chime, a challenger bank that offers its members access to a suite of intuitive banking services. Also in the U.S., we signed a debit deal with N26, a mobile banking solution which offers goal-based saving features and early paycheck access. In India, we are partnering with Open, a neobank, which offers businesses everything from banking to automated bookkeeping to launch a suite of innovative products, including a business credit card. We also continued to expand our credential, signing of debit issuance deal with Railsbank, a U.K. fintech. In Korea, we are announcing a partnership with Toss to significantly expand collaboration on the payment business in Korea and globally. Toss is a major fintech startup in Korea and Korea's leading B2B remittance and financial services platform. We recently deepened our partnership with Remitly, a mobile payment service that utilizes Visa Direct to enable users to make P2P international money transfers from the United States and they will now issue visa debit cards. Focusing specifically on merchant acceptance, in Mexico we are expanding access with Clip, a mobile point-of-sale solutions provider to enable merchants to accept digital payments. We are also teaming up with Samsung to allow merchants to accept contactless payments with just an app download and no hardware. So in essence, the phone becomes the terminal. Finally, mobile phone users in India for Visa cardholders will soon be able to use Google Pay to make simple and secure and tokenized payments. We are currently the only card network supported on Google Pay in India. Over time, we look to build more relationships with the entire ecosystem to grow credentials and acceptance globally. Now let me move to the third focus area of increasing customer engagement by enabling a variety of platforms. We are continuing to improve the point-of-sale experience and reduce friction for the entire ecosystem. In the card present environment, we continue to see progress in tap-to-pay. In the United States, I am pleased to say that of the top 10 issuers, eight are now participating. More than a 100 million Visa contactless cards have been now issued and we expect 300 million cards by the end of calendar year 2020. In the card not present environment, we have spoken before about how secure remote commerce or SRC is the way to streamline the digital payment experience across networks, offer greater security and improve sales. I am pleased that this month together with our network peers, we launched click-to-pay, enabled by SRC with a number of merchants and acquirers in the United States. Broader merchant adoption will take place after the holiday season. We are also enabling a variety of platforms to bring improvements to the payment experience whether or not a card is present and the most recent example is with installments. In June, we announced the launch of an installment solution APIs, a beta version, through our Visa Next platform, where issuers can offer installments to their Visa cardholders directly through participating merchants. At the same time, we are making it possible for third parties like Corner and PAYD to leverage our assets and offer a variety of installment options. As we always say, we are not in the business of picking winners and losers. We enable the ecosystem and let the customer determine success. In the fourth quarter, Affirm converted their virtual issuance to Visa and we established a partnership with Afterpay to support the development of innovative installment solutions in the United States. And we continue to focus on new payment flow opportunities as we expand partnerships to remove friction. Visa Direct continues to grow driven by three vectors, increasing the volume with existing use cases and markets, extending existing use cases to new geographies and expanding into new use cases. In our effort to expand P2P payment capabilities in new markets, we teamed up with the platform, V.way in Guatemala to utilize Visa Direct to enable a simple and secure transfer of funds with just a mobile number or email address reaching the unbanked. In Russia, taxi payouts and on-demand loan disbursements are now available and there is a new use case enabling tipping capabilities with Visa Direct, so tips could be paid directly to waiters electronically. In B2B this quarter, Intuit announced Instant Deposit, a new feature that enables real-time disbursements for small business owners using QuickBooks Payments directly to their eligible debit cards using Visa Direct. Most recently, we announced that Oracle ERP customers will be able to make Visa Direct payments right from their accounts payable system, reducing the time and investment needed for companies to adopt new push-to-card payment technology. JPMorgan will offer its commercial clients the ability to more efficiently send digital payments with access to business payments network, a collaboration we have with Billtrust that routes electronic payments from buyers to suppliers through their existing AR provider. We have also opened our Visa B2B Connect network to over 60 markets and added Infosys as a distribution partner to enable financial institutions to send and receive cross-border funds using this new B2B network. We are also working to integrate the four recent acquisitions to expand our value-added capabilities. With Earthport, we expect to have an integrated Visa Direct and Earthport offering in the market in the next few months where clients can send payouts to cards or accounts through a single connection to Visa. For Payworks, we are extending our pipeline for omni-commerce solutions beyond merchants to include more acquirers who can leverage an integrated CyberSource and Payworks platform. With Verifi, as we combine this capability with our traditional dispute process, we plan to grow the Verifi client base through our existing merchant and issuer relationships. For the Rambus token capabilities, we look to grow in two ways. One, by deepening relationships with existing Rambus clients through our large portfolio of value-added services. And two, by expanding the tokenization offerings for more alternative payment rails. And lastly, network of networks. All of these partnerships and capabilities we have discussed as well as many others come together in our offering to provide a powerful network of networks for consumers, businesses and governments to move money to anyone, anywhere. Each new network endpoint be it a card, an account or a business compounds the value of the capabilities we offer to partners and improves the customer experience through a single Visa connection. To close, in 2019, we delivered strong broad-based results and we made great progress positioning the business for future growth. We deepened partnerships, we expanded access with new players, we increased customer engagement and value-added capabilities and we expanded our acceptance points and our network of networks. As we look ahead to next year, we are excited to remain the official payment technology partner of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics and the only card accepted at next Summer's game. As the world third largest economy, Japan is the market that has tremendous growth potential for Visa and we have an aligned national interest in expanding digital payments. While occurring in Japan, Tokyo 2020 will be a major global media event projected to be the biggest in history with 7,000 hours of broadcast programming and three billion minutes of streamed content in the United States alone. We will aim to expand this platform to Visa clients all over the world and expect to have a record number of sponsorship activations with our partners. As it relates to the 2020 fiscal year, our financial outlook includes annual revenue growth of low double-digits and mid-teens adjusted EPS growth on a constant dollar basis. Before I turn it over to Vasant to go into a lot more details on our results as well as our 2020 outlook, I want to note that as I look ahead, I am excited about the multi-year journey we are on to get more involved in all money movement and I can't recall a time in Visa's history with so much opportunity ahead. To that end, we want to spend some time with all of you discussing our future growth. So we are going to host an Investor Day on February 11, here in San Francisco. With that for more details, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you Al and good afternoon everyone. I will cover fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year results before reviewing our outlook for fiscal year 2020. Building on the momentum from the third quarter, we had a strong finish to 2019. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenues were up 13% on a nominal dollar basis and 15% in constant dollars. GAAP EPS grew 9%, but excluding this quarter's special item related to the MDL litigation as well as a special item in the fourth quarter of last year, non-GAAP EPS grew 21% and 23% in constant dollars. In September, 2019, Visa recorded a $370 million accrual in connection with MDL 1720, depositing an additional $300 million into its litigation escrow and taking into account $70 million of earned interest on existing balances. The funding of the escrow triggers the conversion rate adjustment of Class B common stock to shares of Class A common stock, which has the same effect on EPS as repurchasing $300 million of Class A common stock. Our strong performance in the fourth quarter reflected growth across all our key business drivers. Payments volume growth in constant dollars was consistent with Q3 at 9%. Credit was up 7%, debit was up 11%. Growth excluding China was up 0.5 point better than Q3 at 10%. As a reminder, Chinese domestic volumes are impacted by dual-branded card conversions, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was up 8% with credit growing 7% and debit 10%. Lower fuel prices and travel spending, the lapping of commercial card wins and some slowdown in commercial volume were partially offset by a small benefit from processing days. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 10% and 12%, excluding China accelerating approximately one point and 1.5 points respectively. Growth in CEMEA remained strong and accelerated to 25%. Latin America accelerated over two points to 18%, due to wins and strong performance at existing clients. Asia-Pacific, excluding China, grew 11%, accelerating one point, mostly due to Japan, Australia and Korea. Europe, excluding the U.K., grew 13% up 0.5 point. The U.K. remains weak, but growth has now improved for two quarters after hitting a low in March. Processed transactions grew 11%, down 0.5 point from the third quarter, mostly due to the U.S. Constant dollar cross-border growth was consistent with the last quarter, up 7% and up 9% excluding volumes within Europe, which have similar revenue yields as Europe domestic volume. Travel related growth slowed a bit, but was offset by a small pickup in e-commerce growth. Outbound commerce accelerated from Latin America, Southeast Asia and across most of our CEMEA region. Inbound commerce into Europe continues to grow in the mid-teens. Inbound to the U.S. improved slightly, but remains weak and growth into Hong Kong slowed significantly. Net revenues grew 13% or 15% in constant dollars with three points of positive impact from ASC 606. The ASC 606 impact was larger than expected based on the final structure of some of our larger client deals, which is a result of how the market has evolved in the seven quarters since 606 was adopted by most companies. The impact of acquisitions on revenue growth was de minimis. Strong payments volume growth along with pricing benefits drove service revenues up 9%. Data processing revenue grew 16%, up three points from last quarter, primarily due to favorable business mix. International transaction revenue grew 11% also accelerating three points from the third quarter due to a smaller exchange rate drag and higher currency volatility. Other revenues grew 35% from growth in our value-added service as well as ASC 606 impacts. Client incentives were 21.6% of gross revenue. As Al mentioned, we signed a number of significant deals this quarter in addition to the JPMorgan Chase renewal going into effect. Although all the deals we expected to get done this quarter were completed, a number of them were signed late in the quarter. As such, under ASC 606, the full impact of these deals will be reflected in incentives starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. GAAP operating expenses were up 18%. Excluding special items this year and last year, expense growth was 11%, largely driven by personnel, marketing and some one-time items. Marketing expenses grew 16%, due primarily to the adoption of ASC 606. General and administrative expenses grew 30% due to several non-recurring items from lapping a one-time benefit last year as well as ASC 606 impacts and indirect taxes. ASC 606 increased reported fourth quarter expense growth by about 2.5 points. The impact of acquisitions on expenses was also minimal. Non-operating expenses once again benefited from investment gains, which were $41 million this quarter. These gains were partially offset by lower interest income as a result of falling interest rates. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 18.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.9%, excluding an $83 million tax benefit from the MDL related litigation provision. We repurchased 2.2 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $177.28 or $2.2 billion in the quarter. Including our quarterly dividend, we returned $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the fiscal fourth quarter. Finally, we closed on Verifi in mid-September as well as the token services business of Rambus earlier this week. As you know, we have closed on Earthport and Payworks earlier in the quarter. A fixed summary of fiscal year 2019. For fiscal 2019, payments volume grew over 9% in constant dollars and 10% excluding China. Processed transactions growth was steady at 11%. Cross-border volumes were up 6% on a constant basis and 8% excluding volume within Europe. For the full year, net revenues of $23 billion grew 11% or 13% in constant dollars with over 1.5 points of positive impact from ASC 606. Client incentives were lower than we expected at 21.2% of gross revenues, mostly due to lower incentives from some deals and programs and lower volumes in some parts of the world. Operating expenses were up 4% on a GAAP basis, but grew 11% excluding special items both this year and last. We continue to invest in our growth program given the large opportunities available to expand new payment flows and provide more value-added services to our clients. Non-operating expenses were much lower, due to higher interest income on our cash balances, lower interest expense as a result of swapping some of our U.S. dollar debt to Euro denominated debt and several non-recurring investment gains totaling $131 million. Our tax rate of just under 19% was better than expected due to the application of tax reform rules on foreign income related to FDII and GILTI. GAAP EPS grew 20%, while non-GAAP EPS increased 18% and 20% in constant dollars. We returned $10.9 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 56.1 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $154.25 for $8.6 billion and by paying a dividend of $2.3 billion. Through October 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 8% with U.S. credit growing 7% and debit 9%. Processed transactions grew 11%. Cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 8% or 10%, excluding cross-border volume within Europe. Moving now to our outlook for fiscal year 2020. There is quite a bit of speculation that we are heading into a global economic slowdown. From the numbers we have reported for the last two quarters, you can see that growth trends of all our key business drivers, payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volume have been stable. We do not view ourselves as economic forecasters. As such, our outlook assumes that the trends which have been in place for the past couple of quarters continue through fiscal year 2020. Where we are aware of something specific that could impact the trend, either a fiscal year 2020 event or the lapping effect of a fiscal year 2019 event, we adjust our outlook accordingly. For net revenues, our outlook assumes low double-digit growth in constant dollars. Based on current exchange rates and future expectations, currency translation could be a one to 1.5 percentage point drag. The four acquisitions we completed in the past four months are expected to add around 0.5 point to net revenue growth. A significant factor impacting fiscal year 2020 net revenue growth will be the unusually high volume of renewal activities that Al referred to. In an average year, we renew approximately 20% of our payment volume. In fiscal year 2019, we renewed about 30% of our payment volume with more than 15% renewed in the fourth quarter alone. This means that the full impact of these renewals will be reflected in fiscal year 2020. Also, our fiscal year 2020 renewal activity is front-loaded with another 15% to 20% of payments volume expected to be renewed in the first half. As such, we will have renewed about one-third of our payments volume over three quarters from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, which is an unprecedented level of renewal activity. Between fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020, we expect to have renewed four out of our top five U.S. clients, eight out of our top 10 clients in CEMEA and Latin America, six of our top 10 European clients, five of our top 10 clients in Asia. We are delighted to have renewed all this business for the foreseeable future but it will cause a much higher level of incentive growth in fiscal year 2020 than we had in fiscal year 2019 or in recent years. As such, we expect our client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to climb to the 22.5% to 23.5% range in fiscal year 2020. In terms of pricing, through the first half of fiscal year 2020, we will continue to benefit from FY2019 pricing actions. Fiscal year 2020 pricing actions impact our revenue starting mid-year and are smaller in magnitude than fiscal year 2019 pricing. As such, the pricing benefit in service revenues and international transaction revenues will be lower in the second half. Our outlook assumes core expense growth in the mid to high single-digit range in constant dollars. Based on current exchange rates and future expectations, reported expense growth could be one points to 1.5 points lower in nominal dollars. The four acquisitions will add three points to four points to expense growth. In terms of core expense growth, as you all know we have stepped up our level of investment in the past couple of years to capture the exciting opportunities we have to build revenues from new payment flows and value-added services. We will continue these investments into fiscal year 2020 and beyond to sustain double-digit revenue growth. As a reminder 2020 is also an Olympics year. We expect Tokyo 2020 to be a significant brand-building opportunity and we will invest accordingly. The three to four additional points of expense growth from acquisitions is driven by their run rate expenses as well as one-time cost to integrate these acquisitions and the impact of purchase accounting, i.e., intangible amortization. The non-operating income/expense line includes three major items, interest expenses to service our outstanding debt, interest income from our cash balances and gains or losses from our investments both realized and unrealized since we have to mark our investments to market each quarter based on observable prices. In fiscal year 2019, we recorded a total of $131 million in investment gains, over $0.04 per share, the bulk of them in the second quarter at $84 million and $41 million in the fourth quarter. As is our practice, we do not assume any investment gains or losses in our outlook since these are neither predictable nor recurring. As we have done this year, we will specifically identify the amount of investment gains or losses, if any, that we have recorded each quarter in fiscal year 2020. Interest income in FY2020 is expected to be significantly lower due to the decline in interest rates, as well as somewhat lower cash balances since we use cash on hand to fund all our acquisitions and investments. Interest expenses will be lower as we get the full-year benefit of the swaps we executed in fiscal year 2019. Our expectation is for a tax rate in the range of 19% to 19.5% for fiscal year 2020. At this point, we are assuming a rate in the lower half of this range. There is a considerable amount of tax related activity by governments around the world which we are closely monitoring to assess any impact on our taxes as well as mitigating actions we can take. As always, we will provide updates, if any, to our tax rate expectation as the year progresses. Putting all this together gets us to an adjusted fiscal year 2020 EPS growth in the mid-teens in constant dollars. This adjusted EPS growth excludes the four acquisitions we just completed and is built off a fiscal year 2019 EPS of $5.40. $5.40 is our reported non-GAAP fiscal year 2019 EPS with approximately $0.04 of investment gains excluded. Exchange rates could reduce reported EPS growth by one point to 1.5 point. Dilution from acquisitions is expected to be in the $0.05 to $0.06 range, a one point drag on EPS growth. Revenue expense and EPS growth could vary modestly from quarter-to-quarter. Q1 revenue growth is expected to be weaker than the full year due to lapping higher currency volatility in fiscal year 2019 as well as client incentives climbing to the 22.5% to 23.5% of gross revenue range. Q3 could be our lowest growth quarter as we lap fiscal year 2019 pricing actions that were larger than what is planned for this year as well as expected heavy first half renewal activity. Q4 is likely to be the highest revenue growth quarter as we lap recent deal activity and potentially lower exchange rate headwinds. Expense growth will be higher in the first half of the year as we continue investment initiatives started in the second half of fiscal year 2019. Q1 expense growth is expected to be in line with this past quarter. Q2 expense growth will be higher as marketing expenses ramp up relative to a low level of spend last year. The fourth quarter is likely to have the lowest expense growth as we lap some one-time items. As a result, EPS growth could be lowest in the second quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. Moving on to capital, cash flow, dividends and buybacks. Capital spending in fiscal year 2020 is likely to be around $800 million, up a little over 10%. Based on our earnings outlook and capital spending plan, free cash flow from operations is anticipated to be in excess of $12 billion and we anticipate returning at least $12 billion to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks. The Visa Board has authorized a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.30 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, in line with our dividend policy. This puts our payout ratio in the 20% to 25% range. In summary, fiscal year 2019 was another year of strong growth for Visa. While delivering in the short term, we have continued to invest significantly in long term growth program in our core C2B business, in developing a broad range of new payment flows across B2B, B2C and B2B, as well as our expanding suite of value-added services. We acquired four companies that substantially expand our capabilities on multiple fronts. This is a time of unprecedented opportunity in our business. Partnerships have always been a force multiplier for us to drive growth in our credentials, add more points of acceptance and develop more use cases on our rails. As Al described again this quarter, we continue to add exciting new and significant partners globally with win-win propositions for both parties. As we look ahead, we expect to sustain revenue and EPS growth momentum in the fiscal year 2020 assuming no material change in macroeconomic conditions. We have renewed about 30% of our payments volume in fiscal year 2019 with another 20%-plus slated for renewals in fiscal year 2020. While this will cause a large jump in incentives in fiscal year 2020, we are pleased to have renewed a significant portion of our largest clients for the foreseeable future. We will also continue to invest at a healthy clip in long term growth initiatives and integrating the four acquisitions is a critical priority. With that, I will turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: We are now ready to take questions, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from David Koning from Baird. Your line is open.\nDavid Koning: Yes. Hi guys. Thanks. And I guess just two kind of quick questions, first of all, incentives growth. You kind of mentioned, it's much higher than normal this year. Is it high enough than normal with some one-time items kind of with renewals in there that out year might actually be stable or even down maybe? And then the second is quick one just on 606. Is that all completely now in the past? So no other adjustments kind of in 2020?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. On the second question, yes, 606 is behind us. So now when you compare 2020 to 2019, it's apples-to-apples. And as per the requirements, we will no longer be reporting numbers with and without 606 et cetera. So that's fairly clean. In terms of your question about what happens in the future? Clearly, I mean, having all this renewal activity come in from the fourth quarter, you see the full effect in 2020 for the full year and then you have the additional renewals in the first half. As we lap them, I mean, given that we would have renewed about 50% of our business over the two years, you would expect to see some moderation in the growth in incentives. So that should be expected. Obviously, we don't provide any long term outlook on the trend in incentives. It's a function of marketplace conditions. But there is no question that when you renew a third of your business over a three quarter period that it will have a material impact on the rate of growth. And then as you lap it, it should help.\nDavid Koning: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi. Good afternoon. AI, my question is on your comment on partnerships. A few years ago, many of the digital wallets around the world were perceived to be risk for you. And recently, many of them have started to look more like partners as they have to refined their monetization strategy. So if I look at some of the sort of lingering competitive risk, for example the domestic networks, can you talk about where are we in that journey that they could look less like competitors and more like partners? I think, if you comment in providing network agnostic services that were still going to be [indiscernible] to some of these alternative networks, it would be great if you can elaborate on that.\nAl Kelly: Sure. Thank you Harshita. Look, a lot of these players started out in a different business. Then they realized that because, in many cases on banks parts of the population, they end up developing wallets and they started off with having them be in essence a closed loop network that is within their world. And then as they become bigger and we end up having discussions with them, they realized that we could bring a lot of things to them in terms of our global reach, cross-border capabilities, the ability to provide products that could be used to purchase in e-commerce, capabilities to increased security like tokenization. And them, by the way, can help us grow by being both a issuer and acquirer for us. So I think that as we sit down and we increasingly talk to these providers around the world, they see an ability to provide a better customer experience with greater reach for their clients and the same for us. And it's just good for both company's businesses.\nHarshita Rawat: Thank you.\nMike Milotich: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays Global. Your line is now open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Thanks for taking my question. I had a somewhat similar question about your guys moving more into other ancillary business lines through fintech partnerships and M&A. How do you manage the risk of channel conflict with your existing customers if you are stepping a little bit more on the toes of folks who are in the network businesses in terms of moving money between banks or maybe people who are acquirers, who are offering omni-channel solutions like Payworks? Is there a risk that you kind of disrupt the value chain kind of moving into these other areas?\nAl Kelly: Well, Ramsey, today we have 16,000 financial services clients around the globe and they come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. And the reality is that many of these new players that are coming into the marketplace are attracting new segments of the market and they are bringing new capabilities that are accelerating the growth of digital payments and the acceleration of moving from cash and check to digital forms of payments. In many cases, we in fact are opening up the capability for our existing traditional clients to get their credentials involved in places that they probably otherwise wouldn't have been able to get them, but for us forming partnerships with some of these new types of players. So I think in many of the cases, it becomes additive for everybody in the payment system. It becomes additive for our traditional bank partners. It becomes additive for the fintech or the wallet or the neobank player and it becomes additive for Visa. So it is something that we certainly remain focused on it, but it's all about growing the industry for all of the players in the ecosystem.\nVasant Prabhu: So Ramsey, I mean, from our standpoint, the question you raise is a question we talk about all the time. This is a business built on partnerships. This is a business where partnerships are very much, as I said in my comments, a force multiplier. In every situation, we have a very explicit conversation around things that we partner to do and things that we should do ourselves. And to the extent that it is a channel conflict question, we very clearly steer clear of those areas. And so when we have those kinds of issues, we typically partner and where we don't, that's when you might find us actually offering the service ourselves.\nRamsey El-Assal: Thanks. That's helpful. Yes. Thank you.\nMike Milotich: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hi guys. Thanks. Cross-border growth looked like it accelerated a bit. I think 8% in October. And there has been questions around macro trends and potentially slower cross-border, just globally in September, October from different parts of the ecosystem and just doesn't look like you are seeing that. So maybe just if you can give us some comment on what you are seeing in cross-border trends a bit more granularity? And then Vasant, it also looks like revenue growth accelerated in the international fees. I know there was pricing earlier in the year on cross-border, but FX vol had weighed some of that down last quarter. So are we now seeing was that better this quarter? Are we seeing the full flow-through of pricing there? Thanks guys.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. On the second question, yes. I mean the full impact of pricing is visible in the second half and it is definitely visible on the international revenues line. It also is the case that some of it was muted in the third quarter because as you know that line also includes some of our exchange FX revenues and the third quarter had some of the lowest volatility in five years. And the fourth quarter saw some improvement. Volatility was still lower relatively speaking, but it was improved from the third quarter. So the benefits of pricing, which were largely washed out by low volatilities in the third quarter, were more visible in the fourth quarter. But you are right that pricing is showing up in that international revenues line. In terms of your first question on cross-border trends. Cross-border trends, as I indicated, were pretty good all over the place. We highlighted some areas where they were stronger like CEMEA, like Southeast Asia. Inbound into Europe has stayed strong for quite a while in the mid-teens. This excludes what we call the intra-Europe cross-border transactions. Inbound to the U.S., which is a sizable business for us, improved a bit, but it's still quite weak. So the strong dollar is certainly holding down inbound to the U.S. There were spots of weakness, as you might expect, like inbound to Hong Kong. In fact, both in and outbound to Hong Kong. But by and large, we saw good improvement in Latin America, good improvement in parts of Asia. Certainly strong inbound to Europe. So no real indication that there is any change in trend. I think there was, we said there was some slowdown in travel, but it was more than made up for improvements in e-commerce. So I would say stable to improving is probably the best way to describe it.\nMike Milotich: Next question?\nDarrin Peller: That's great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. I had a question about, I think your words were, unprecedented levels of renewal activity. And I am thinking in terms of historically it's been 20%, so it would have been parsed out a little bit more evenly. This is clearly more of a compression cycle. And so the question is, is it driven by competition? Is it like strategic positioning on your part? Or is it important to like lock down your partners today so you can drive all this new innovation through their distribution asset? I am just trying to think through that. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: You know, Dan every year we go in the year, there is just a couple of deals that come up that were not necessarily up for renewal. It happened during the course of the year and they are occur because they have senior discussion about, hey, why don't we extend our relationship and be able to focus on growth over the next couple of years. And this year was no different. There were a couple of deals that were early renewals that just as happens every year. But they were just a couple of the bigger clients of ours with Chase leading the pack in that category. And that's really what drove the number up to the 30% level from kind of a norm of around 20%.\nDan Perlin: Okay. Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: And the bunching of it sort of around the fourth quarter and the first half, that's just some timing that happens within the year. So it just so happens that it all is happening over a three quarter period where we have a third of our business renewing. So that's a little bit of just things moving around a bit and bunching around three quarters.\nDan Perlin: High quality problem. Thank you.\nMike Milotich: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks so much. Thanks for the presentation. I just wanted to ask on the outlook. The fiscal 2020 revenue growth guidance looks pretty consistent with what you expected for fiscal 2019 a year ago. So do you see any major differences in sources of growth expected this year? I heard the incentives outlook. It sounds like there's a little bit tougher. So what might get better to offset that? Is it pricing? Is it higher expectation for certain products or maybe certain geographies? Any thing you can share there? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. We have some benefit in the U.S. because we start to lap the Cabela's conversion. Internationally, we have some wins and we have a couple of our conversions moving away from us happening. So I would say, that's a little bit of a wash. If you look at our cross-border business, our second half trends were somewhat better than our first half, especially fourth quarter. And we are sort of assuming the second half trends are what continue going forward. And as you can see that is continuing. The pricing impact is actually smaller in 2020. We get the benefits of the 2019 pricing through the first half, but it is lower in 2020. So the second half pricing benefit is smaller, especially in the service revenue line and in the international transactions line you should see that. The other area of growth is our value-added services and new payment flow services like Visa Direct, like B2B where we expect some strong growth to continue. We had good growth this year as you saw. We expect strong growth to continue next year. So if you were to look at what are the above average growth parts of the business, it's new payment flows and it's value-added services and those are clearly helping. On the flip side, the higher incentive will be something that we have to contend with that we didn't have last year. Unfortunately exchange rates, which even three or four months ago look like may not be a drag now are looking like could be a drag of roughly the same magnitude as we had in fiscal year 2019. So those are some of the pluses and minuses. And in terms of the underlying macro conditions, we were fairly clear that we are assuming that the trends we have seen in the last two quarters are the ones will that will persist.\nAl Kelly: Tien-Tsin, the only thing I would add too is related to everything that Vasant said, is we are going to continue to invest in the business. We think there's a lot of opportunity to invest. So continuing to invest in the various levers that we think can grow the business over the next number of years plus these acquisitions adding three points or four points to our expense growth. We are going to have some. We are going to have a healthy level of expense and investment in the business.\nMike Milotich: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Moshe Katri from Wedbush. Your line is open.\nMoshe Katri: Can we talk a bit about the SRC rollout? What are you going to do differently this time just to get better traction, maybe you can talk a bit about that? And then maybe some more color about the U.K., because it seems that based on what you are saying, things may be improving on that part of the business? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Good morning, Katri. I understand I know SRC, when you said what will happen this time versus some other time. I mean, this is, I presume you might be referring to Visa Checkout. As I have said it number of times, the reality is that we, the various network players, really have not heretofore done good job in terms of the e-commerce checkout experience. The fact that we put merchants in a position where they have to have a connection for each of the networks and then everybody has their own version of checkout is difficult for merchants, it's confusing for consumers and it's leading to some unpleasant friction in the e-commerce situation. So all of us now, we are going to abandon our proprietary offerings, but because those proprietary offerings are out there like Visa Checkout, it's going to make for a much more streamlined way to get to critical mass fairly quickly. As a reminder, in the case of Visa, we have 52 million Visa Checkout users and we have 350,000 merchants on Visa Checkout. So we would expect that the conversion of those 350,000 merchants will be relatively easy. There is a little bit of work, but relatively easy. Easier then putting people who had not been signed up for Visa Checkout or MasterPass, for example, in the case of MasterCard. It's just that the timing of the year now as we are getting to the end of October, we will see some more merchants come on-board in the coming weeks. But as we get into the holiday season, most everybody kind of resists putting any kind of change into the payments ecosystem. So I think we will have a period where we will have some merchants come on-board. We will get out, work out the kinks with those merchants and then after the holiday season, I expect to see a major pickup in the adoption of the SRC. And again, I think we will have a great head start, because of the 52 million users we have on Visa Checkout and the 350,000 merchants that they are using it at. So that's what gives me confidence that we will get there. It's a better user experience. It's a better merchant experience. And we plumbed a lot of the capability to get this SRC button up by what the work we did it for Visa Checkout.\nMike Milotich: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Vasant, I guess the client incentive range is on the upper end. Generally, it's been fairly conservative. As we look out to the 2020 numbers. I mean, can you just walk us through sort of what's baked into at the upper end? And then secondly on the 3% to 4% expense growth related to M&A, how much of it is investments and how quickly can we make these investments profitable?\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. On the client incentives, given that the renewal, 30% of our business was renewed in fiscal year 2019 and more than half of that was in the fourth quarter, that's done. So those incentives are pretty well known. And the only reason they would be different is IF volumes are different. But otherwise, that should be pretty locked in. There is another, we said 15% to 20% that is slated for renewals in the first half. And therefore, we should know about that fairly quickly. So I would say, yes, in the last couple of years, we have ended up being lower than we expected. Given how much is already renewed and given how front-loaded 2020 looks, I think you should assume that the range we have provided you is the range. Where exactly we will be in the range may depend a little bit on some timing, but not a lot. And it will get to that range pretty fast. As we said in my comments, you should see us in the range as earlier as the first quarter. So that's the point of view on incentives. In terms of acquisitions, we said that the revenue impact is about 0.5 point. They are all capabilities we are buying. So essentially we need to now build them up from where they are to be able to scale them. And so the expanses we have fall into four categories. One is whatever expenses they came with, what their run rate is. In every case, we are making investments to enhance their capabilities and to get them ready to scale. So we are certainly making investments in them in 2020. Then there are some one-time costs in 2020 that are related to integrating them into our system and especially on the security side. We need, in most cases, to upgrade their cyber security. And then finally, as you know, in every acquisition, there is going to be some deal amortization. So when you put those all together, you get to that expense number that increases our expenses by as much as three to four points and you get to the dilution of $0.05 to $0.06. So that's how we get there. We think it takes a couple of years before we get to getting out of this. This is a dilutive phase. But we will keep you posted on how they are progressing.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nMike Milotich: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is opened.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Al, maybe using Rambus' tokenization capabilities as an example, can you elaborate on the strategy for selling these types of value-added services into domestic account-to-account networks? Meaning, how are you envisioning that will work in a way that doesn't just end up turning those domestic networks into more formidable competitors to Visa's own VisaNet? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thank you Lisa. So when we look at value-added services, we think that first of all, there is an ability to make some of these capabilities available directly to our customers. But beyond that, as you asked the question relative to specific networks, we are going to be awfully careful about what we do. I mean these RTP network that might allow account-to-account capabilities, obviously is a very local business. They vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. I think there's probably two examples where I would envision offering value-added services on RTP networks. One is on Visa-branded transactions that run on our network of networks. So we may use other people's rails for the first mile or the last mile of money movement. And in those particular cases, if it's a Visa-branded transaction that is moving, regardless of what rails it touches, we would want to make value-added services available to deliver that value to the clients. And that's what I think they would expect. I think the second situation where we would envision using it, Lisa, is where we have formed some kind of partnership with the operator of the alternative rail. So I think about it right now, we will make decisions on a case-by-case basis, because there are all these situations that are very, very different. But those two broad strategic categories that I described is where I would expect us to use and introduce value-added services because we certainly don't want to just do it in every single case to give away value-added services that could make somebody's else's network maybe not as good as VisaNet, but enrich it in a way that could be competitive to us.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you. Thanks a lot.\nMike Milotich: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line is open.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Just on the new payment flows, I guess is there a way, can you comment on like the percentage of your business or way to track the addition to your growth that would come from new payment flows, whether it's B2B or Visa Direct. And also on the contactless cards in the U.S., which I guess is kind of a new payment flow of sorts, any thoughts that you think the contactless cards would have on growth in the U.S., given your experience globally?\nAl Kelly: So Bob, I gave you a little bit of insight in my remarks, I would say. We are over $1 trillion. So I said in my remarks that we had just under $9 trillion of payment commerce that ran over our network. Of that, we were over $1 trillion in B2B. So it's about 12% of our volume. We know in the carded B2B part of the world, we are still the market leader in the United States globally and in most markets. We also gave a little bit of insight in Visa Direct. We said that we grew in triple digits and we reached the two billion transaction mark. So both of those are pretty substantive. B2B being in the 12% area of all of our volume and Visa Direct getting to the point where it's two billion transactions. So these are not kind of experimental or in any way, shape or form in any kind of pilot mode at this point. These are kind of full-fledged new payment flows that we are continuing to invest in and we will continue to grow around the world and they have reached a point where obviously they are substantive contributors to our revenue and our profit. In the case of contactless, obviously we are very excited about getting to the point where the U.S. starts to scale up as it relates to contactless. I think getting now past the 100 million card mark and getting 80% of, the top issuers involved and at the same time getting a large part of the merchant network out there plump for tap-to-pay, I think that there is going to be a great opportunity to see growth. And what we have seen in the markets that are more mature in tap-to-pay that there is a spillover effect in terms of people who are tapping to pay start to increase their volume overall and we are going to continue to push. One of the, what we think is a very, very important use case related to tap-to-pay, which is urban mobility projects particularly focused on mass transit systems. Just in the last quarter, we launched contactless travel in Edinburgh, Scotland, Rome, Sao Paulo. And now we have added 60 new metro areas, transit systems to our tap-to-pay network. And we have got a 180 or so other live projects going on around the world. So I see a combination of driving, what I think is one of the great use cases, transit and continuing to roll out tap-to-pay around the world with a particular emphasis on the U.S. since it's been so far behind. And in the U.S., as you might know, in the New York subway system we have it up and going in a pilot. I think it's 70 stops on four, five, six line from Grand Central Station to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. And in September, we launched it at the beginning of June and in September we have reached a million taps. And that's pretty incredible, given the fact that we are still in the very early stages of rolling out the tap-to-pay card. So I feel good about the progress. But the last point I would make, Bob, is it typically takes the most time to get to the first 5% to 10% penetration in tap-to-pay. And then the growth rate starts to accelerate from there. And we are in the 2% to 3% point in the United States. So we are still in that more formative building stage. But I think by the end of 2020, if we hit the 300 million contactless cards and the MTA as one example rolls it out to their, I think it's like 270 subway stations, I think we are going to see a real acceleration in the momentum of the growth.\nMike Milotich: Jordan, we will take one last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thanks. Hi Alf. Hi Vasant. Good to see you guys sounding more positive. I wanted to return to cross-border, if I can. Can you discuss sort of the traction and rollout that you have with B2B Connect in Earthport, post-acquisition? Any metrics on that that you can provide in terms of how much do you expect these offerings to accelerate cross-border, perhaps in the coming to 12 months to 18 months?\nAl Kelly: So let's separate the two. I mean, given what I just said about Visa Direct and that it's a very established platform that is delivering a substantive contribution to our business now, our aim is to have fully integrate Earthport with Visa Direct by the end of the year to have a seamless platform that allows any card or any account to transfer money around the world to virtually any other card or account. And so I think the ability to see in the not too distant future, a real great opportunity as it relates to cross-border payments facilitated by Visa Direct and by Earthport is very real and very, very exciting. B2B Connect is a little bit further behind, but no less exciting. We now have the ability and approvals to operate in over 60 countries. We have got three different ways that people can connect through to connect B2B Connect. One is, coding to our APIs through our Visa Developer Platform or they can connect through a technology provider and we have got relationships now with FIS, Bottomline and Infosys. And then thirdly, they can connect and interact using a host-to-host secure file protocol infrastructure. The latter being kind of the slowest way to get it up and going, using and coding to our APIs being the fastest play. So our focus right now in B2B Connect is actually building out the nodes in the 60 countries. And by the way we want to grow the 60 countries too. So we try to grow the 60 countries and within the countries where we have the capability and the permissions and approvals to operate, we want to be growing the nodes. So that's our focus as it relates to B2B Connect. I think both of them represents an enormous opportunity for us to move funds in a frictionless way, facilitating all the great capabilities of VisaNet from sanctions controls to fraud controls to risk management. And I think in all cases, our aim is to deliver capabilities that are faster, more transparent and a simply better user experience for everybody involved. So it's exciting times on both of those fronts.\nVasant Prabhu: And what it allows us to do is, in the B2B space, the cross-border B2B business we think is the most attractive part. And Earthport/Visa Direct will handle high volume, lower value B2B transactions and B2B Connect will handle the large enterprise, high value, lower volume B2B transactions. And as Al said, they will be in place very soon to pull all this together.\nMike Milotich: And with that, I would like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our Investor Relations team. Thanks again and have a great evening."}, {"symbol": "V", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-07-23 21:51:08", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Visa\u2019s Fiscal Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Milotich, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Visa\u2019s fiscal third quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.

Now, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Mike, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It is clear from our strong results today that the business continues to perform well as we simultaneously invest to deliver growth in the medium to long term. Given that it was a busy quarter, I\u2019m going to streamline my comments on the business performance and only offer a few headlines; then, I\u2019ll discuss how we are enhancing our capabilities through our recent acquisitions and investments; and finally, I\u2019ll review our progress in building partnerships around the globe with FinTechs as well as our traditional clients. So, let\u2019s start with our third quarter results. Revenue growth was better than expected at 11% or 13% on a constant dollar basis. Payments volume growth was 9% on a constant dollar basis or almost 10% excluding China, which continued to be impacted by some runoff of our dual branded cards that captured domestic volumes and had limited impact on our revenue. Cross border growth rebounded up 3 points from last quarter and client incentives were lower than anticipated. Processed transaction growth accelerated to 12%. Adjusted expense growth was 10%, reflecting marketing investments, the impact of the new revenue accounting standard, and a number of nonrecurring items. And adjusted EPS growth was 14%, lapping a low adjusted tax rate of 18% last year. Vasant will share more details in his remarks. As we look ahead to the future, we\u2019re pursuing our strategy by A, investing in growing and enhancing our network, including capturing new payment flows, building out our acceptance footprint and expanding our base of clients. We\u2019re building our arsenal of value-added capabilities that could be components on our network or on other networks, what we call network-agnostic, and see we\u2019re fortifying key bedrock pillars of the business, talent, technology, security, and the brand. Against this backdrop, this quarter, we announced several strategic acquisitions and investments that will accelerate our progress in capturing new payment flows and extend the boundaries of our capabilities and our network. First, we assume control of Earthport in early May and are pleased to say that as of July 4th, we\u2019ve obtained full legal ownership. Earthport provides cross-border payment services via network that connects with local ACH system with direct connections in 88 countries. Before Earthport, through our Visa Direct capabilities, our debit credentials and ATM network, Visa could reach about half of the bank accounts. With Earthport, we\u2019ve become a network of networks and have extended reach to over 99% of bank accounts in the 88 countries including the top 50 markets. Our integration efforts are well underway and we are actively working to launch our first, fully integrated experience, prior to the calendar year-end, which will provide a single connection for clients to push funds to cards via VisaNet and bank accounts via Earthport. Also in the quarter, we announced the acquisitions of Verifi and tokenization business from Rambus, which will help us in our development of network agnostic services, and will be integrated with our existing suite of tokenization, fraud management and risk solutions. This tokenization acquisition will enable Visa to extend the security and convenience of tokenization to all types of transactions including the ability to support domestic card network, account-based and real-time payment systems. Before this acquisition, Visa could turn a 16-digit Visa credential into a token, but now we can tokenize a bank account, a domestic card network credential or a ticket. Verifi\u2019s best in class dispute resolution tools enable issuers to connect with merchant\u2019s data immediately, when a consumer calls to dispute a transaction, so that the issue is settled within one phone call. Verifi is the industry leader with 25,000 merchant connections helping to decrease the time spent on resolution, while at the same time decreasing the percentage of chargebacks. Verifi adds to existing Visa tools, which are aimed at reducing customer friction across the entire payment experience. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Payworks, a point of sale software solution, which enables acquirers to support merchant terminal payments via the cloud. This enables merchants to seamlessly and quickly implement new functionalities such as adding new payment types, thereby creating better customer experiences and lower merchant operating costs. Payworks will add in-store payment processing to CyberSource\u2019s InComm ecommerce payments platform to create a fully integrated omnichannel payment acceptance solution. As part of CyberSource\u2019s solution to acquire, these capabilities will be white label to drive more innovation in the payments ecosystem. Across Southeast Asia, we have partnered with and invested in Gojek, a ride-hailing service that has become a mobile Super Approximately, featuring over 18 different verticals spanning payments, delivery, laundry cleaning, tickets and more. To give you a sense of the magnitude of Gojek, they have 108 million app downloads and half have been used in the payment service, GoPay. We\u2019re working together to make digital payments easier for both GoPay and Visa users while expanding to new use cases. In the B2B space, we recently announced an investment in PayMate, a leading B2B payments FinTech in India who we have been partnering with in India and our CEMEA region since last year. PayMate operates a portal, connecting 35,000 buyers and suppliers to provide buyers with a consolidated view of their accounts payable across all payment types. Through the use of Visa credentials, buyers and suppliers have access to better reconciliation data. Our partnership and investment seek to drive incremental volume to our network by helping big and small businesses bring more efficiencies to their payment processes as well as transition from cash and checks to digital payments via a Visa credential. Visa Direct continues to deliver transaction growth of over 100% and opens up opportunities for additional payment flows. In the U.S. alone, over the last 12 months, more than 60 million Visa credentials have sent or received funds via Visa Direct, 75% of which have completed more than one transaction using Visa credentials. About 70% of these users have received funds which can drive additional spend in our C2B. In cross-border remittance, we\u2019ve announced a new strategic relationship with Western Union. Western Union adds to our growing list of partners in this area, including MoneyGram, Remitly and EMQ, allowing their customers to make cost-effective cross-border payments through Visa credential with speed, convenience and transparency. In addition to cross-border remittance, Visa Direct has also grown in the insurance disbursement space. Today 5 of the top 10 insurance companies in the United States either are using or in the process of enabling Visa Direct to facilitate quick and secure claims payout to their customers. In Europe, we recently added our first insurance use case with Insurance-as-a-Service provider Setoo in partnership with SafeCharge, a global payment service provider. Another disbursement use case that is gaining traction is small business merchant settlement, which allows acquirers to transfer funds in real time at the request of the merchant, helping with cash flow needs of small businesses. Visa Direct is enabling the recent launch of Instant Transfer by PayPal in Canada, in addition to the United States for same-day settlements to small businesses and individual consumers. As we continue to drive new and existing payment flows, we remain focused on providing exemplary user experiences to ensure that Visa remains the preferred way to pay. Tap to pay significantly improves the point-of-sale experience, and consumers are adopting it quickly. This quarter outside the United States tap to pay surpassed 50% of face-to-face transactions that run over our network, up from less than 30% just three years ago. There are now almost 50 countries where contactless is at least a third of all face-to-face transactions, up from 35 countries at the end of last fiscal year in September. We know that when contactless is introduced to a market, it increases the number of transactions For instance, this past quarter, while UK payments volume grew in the low to mid single digit, processed transactions grew much faster in the double digits. Transaction growth was 2.5 times the rate of payments volume growth and consumers made more small dollar tap to pay transactions with their Visa card instead of cash. Canada has also seen a similar dynamic.  In the United States, we\u2019re well underway to reaching 100 million tap to pay Visa cards in force by the end of 2019, and early adoption is similar to what we\u2019ve seen in other successful tap to pay markets. We expect to surpass 3 million Visa cards by the end of 2020. As we discussed previously, transit continues to be one of the best ways to habituate the use of tap to pay. The New York MTA launched an open loop payments -- a pilot on May 31st in a limited number of stations as part of an 18-month rollout and the results to-date have been very encouraging. Other areas where we\u2019re making progress to improve the user experience include tokenization, secure remote commerce, and the installation payment solution we are piloting. All of these enhancements reflect a fundamental truth that is simple, consistent, secure and frictionless user experience leads to incremental volume and transactions. We know that it takes strong partnerships across the ecosystems to deliver these great user experiences. Therefore, we are actively listening to client and customers\u2019 needs, and working to support their success. Partnerships are not simply additive to our business model, they are fundamental to our business model, whether it\u2019d be our traditional financial institutions or FinTechs. And on FinTechs, they continue to be key enablers around the world and helping to expand access to electronic payments and opening up new acceptance. And these are the natural partner because we bring global scale, a recognizable brand, security, reliability, and sophisticated capability. This quarter was no exception in our ability to develop partnerships with FinTechs. So, I\u2019d like to highlight a few. In India, we launched a co-brand credit card with the largest cab app aggregator, Ola Cabs; and SBI Card, the second largest credit card issuer in the country. With a simplified application process and a seamless card management through their app, this product will offer a rich reward proposition across all those 150 million users. Across Asia Pacific, we\u2019ve partnered with Razer, a global lifestyle brand for gamers with 60 million users to offer a prepaid credential in the Razer Pay e-wallet. In Latin America, Rappi, a leading on-demand delivery platform is now using Visa debit card as the preferred way for its customers to pay in Colombia, Mexico, and soon also in Brazil. They\u2019ve also implemented CyberSource solutions across their seven operating markets to drive more secure and seamless transactions. Rappi currently has more than 20 million registered users and 90,000 delivery drivers who fulfill close to 5 million orders a month. In Turkey, we partnered with one of the largest FinTech, ininal, in an effort to reach the 40% of the Turkish population that is unbanked with the launch of a nationwide program for general purpose, reloadable Visa prepaid card. We\u2019re also excited about the opportunities these new partnerships could bring for sure, but we also continue to build deepen relationships with our more traditional merchants and issuers, and I will call out four this quarter. In Europe, we renewed the credit and commercial portfolios with Bank Leumi, the largest bank in Israel; and Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel, one of the largest issuers in France. Across Europe, our deal volume and win rate is significantly higher on a year-to-year basis -- year-over-year basis. In Brazil, we teamed up with Itau and MercadoLibre to launch a contactless cobranded card targeting MercadoLibre consumers with installment capability and a unique app for managing loyalty points. MercadoLibre has 38 million buyers in Latin America and Brazil, representing 60% of their marketplace\u2019s volume. In the United States, we\u2019re pleased to announce that we have extended our longstanding partnership with JPMorgan Chase through the end of 2029. This long-term extension will enable us to work together to accelerate the growth of electronic payments, deliver enhanced payment experiences, such as our recent collaborations to enable tap to pay in the New York City subway system. Additionally, we work together to support and innovate our world-class co-brand partners and to further extent into the commercial space with B2B solutions. Our pipeline of partnerships is robust, and we expect to sign several other significant renewals and new deals in the remainder of this fiscal year. So, in summary, it was an exciting quarter for Visa with strong results, strategic acquisitions and growth in partnerships. As we look ahead, our focus continues to be expanding our network with a wide variety of new payment flows and acceptance options; growing our value-added services portfolio to enhance all networks, not just Visa\u2019s; investing in foundational elements that make Visa a world class partner, superior talent, innovative and reliable technology, unmatched security and a powerful brand. We remain open minded, innovative and flexible to meet the needs of the growing ecosystem in a rapidly evolving payments landscape as we\u2019re committed to our goal to be the best way to pay and be paid to everyone everywhere. Now, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Despite strong currency headwinds, our business trends accelerated in the third quarter, as net revenue and EPS growth were both higher than expected. Net revenue grew over 11% on a nominal dollar basis and over 13% in constant dollars, while adjusted EPS grew 14% in nominal dollars and approximately 18% on a constant dollar basis. Through three quarters of fiscal 2019, net revenue is up 11% and adjusted EPS up 17% in nominal dollars, and over 12% and 19%, respectively, in constant dollars. A few highlights: Growth across all key business drivers, payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volume accelerated from last quarter. Payments volume growth in constant dollars improved to 9%. Global constant dollar growth excluding China and the UK was over 10%. Chinese domestic volumes are impacted by dual valid cards, which have minimal revenue impact. The UK economy remains weak due to Brexit uncertainty; ex-UK global payments volume trends remain robust. Processed transaction growth accelerated to 12%, primarily due to faster U.S. growth and a full quarter of processing gains in Argentina. Adjusting for cross-border volume within Europe, constant dollar cross-border growth was 9%, up almost 4 points from last quarter, exceeding our expectations. As a reminder, cross-border volume within Europe has revenue yields similar to Europe domestic volumes and continues to be impacted by e-commerce platform, reorienting within the EU. Growth was consistently strong each month after factoring Easter timing in April, and the improvement from last quarter was broad based. Every region\u2019s outbound growth improved by at least 1 point, mostly benefiting Europe and U.S. inbound volume. Net revenue growth was 11.4%, despite 2 points of exchange rate drag and the lowest currency volatility we\u2019ve seen in five years. Growth was helped by stronger cross-border momentum and lower client incentives than expected. The impact of pricing was higher than last quarter. Client incentives were better-than-expected due to lower incentives for some deals and program than we had estimated, lower volumes in some markets and some deal delays. At this point, we have a very robust pipeline of significant renewals and new deals that we expect to get done by the end of our fiscal year. We have closed on Earthport and Payworks as well as signed definitive agreements to acquire two other companies. These acquisitions significantly enhance our capabilities, extending our reach to over 99% of global bank accounts in 88 markets, facilitating tokenization of all types of transactions beyond our own, streamlining dispute resolution and enabling omnichannel payment processing through CyberSource. We expect all these acquisitions to close before the end of the year.  We also added significant new partners, like Gojek, MercadoLibre and Ola Cabs while renewing our enduring partnership with JPMorgan Chase through 2029. We repurchased 12.9 million shares of stock-based common stock at an average price of one $163.59 for $2.1 billion in the first fiscal quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, we returned $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter.  Now, some details on our key business drivers. Payments volume growth on a constant dollar basis accelerated to 9%, credit was up 7%, debit was up 11%. Growth remained strong in most parts of the world with CEMEA growing 22%, Latin America 16%, Asia Pacific excluding China, growing almost 10% and Europe excluding the UK, growing 12%. U.S. payments volume growth was 9%, up 1 point from last quarter. The improvement was driven by the timing of Easter as well as higher consumer credit growth. Fuel prices were ultimately a drag on growth in the quarter as the strong start in April faded in May and June. Double-digit growth was sustained in debit at 11% with Visa Direct contribution similar to last quarter. Credit grew 7% as the impact of the Cabela\u2019s conversion continued and we start to lap commercial card wins from last year. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 9%, growth in CEMEA remained robust at 22% with strong momentum across Russia, the Middle East and Africa. Latin America growth accelerated 2 percentage points to 16%, driven by improvements in Brazil and Mexico. Growth in the UK remained weak. However, growth in the rest of Europe accelerated to 12% with particular strength in Central and Eastern Europe. Asia Pacific growth excluding China was almost 10%, in line with last quarter. Processed transaction growth of 12% is up 1 point from last quarter. Growth in the U.S. accelerated almost 1 point, in line with volumes. Also helping growth was a processing gain in Argentina, which had a full quarter impact. Growth improved in Brazil and was stable in Europe, Asia Pacific and CEMEA. After getting off to a strong start in April, mostly due to Easter timing, cross-border volume growth remained healthy through the quarter, resulting in 7% growth on a constant dollar basis, up 3 points from last quarter. Constant dollar growth adjusted for cross-border volume within Europe was 9%, up 4 points from last quarter with strength across both travel-related online spending. Of the 4-point improvement, approximately 1 point was driven by the lack of cryptocurrency drag that impacted each of the past two quarters due to the spike in cryptocurrency purchases in late 2017 and early 2018. Another couple of points was driven by broad-based spend increases. Outbound commerce accelerated from Canada, Japan, Australia and across most of Latin America and our CEMEA region. Europe was the biggest beneficiary of inbound commerce with growth in the mid-teens. Moving on to a quick summary of third quarter financial results. Net revenue grew at a better than expected 11.4%, driven by higher processed transaction and cross-border volume growth as well as lower client incentives. This growth rate includes a 2-point headwind from exchange rate shift and a sizable drag from low currency volatility. The adoption of ASC-606 lifted revenue by approximately 1.5 points. Service revenue grew 10%, benefiting from pricing. Data processing revenues were up 13%. International revenue increased 8% with pricing actions and a favorable country mix, i.e., slower growth within Europe being significantly offset by lower currency volatility. Other revenue grew 49%, a little over half of which is driven by the adoption of ASC-606 and the remainder a result of clients increasingly utilizing our value-added service capabilities. Incentives as a percent of gross revenues of 20.9% were lower than we expected this quarter due to lower incentives for some deals and programs, some deal delays, and lower volumes in some parts of the world. We expect to see an uptick in incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the fourth quarter, based on the deals just completed in the third quarter and the current pipeline of significant new deals and renewals expected to be signed in Q4. Operating expenses declined 18% on a GAAP basis due to the litigation provision last year associated with the interchange multi-district litigation. Excluding the special items, expenses grew 10%, primarily driven by marketing costs, a number of non-recurring expenses captured in G&A and technology-related investments driving growth in network processing and depreciation expenses. Marketing expenses grew 18%, driven by investments related to the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and the adoption of ASC-606. General and administrative expenses grew 37%, primarily due to several non-recurring items, ASC-606 impacts, and indirect taxes. The adoption of ASC-606 added approximately 2.5 points to expense growth. Non-operating expenses were $78 million higher than last quarter, as investment gains were $9 million in the third quarter versus $84 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have recorded $89 million in investment gains or over $0.03 of EPS, largely due to the change in accounting rules. As you know, this is a non-recurring item. We continue to benefit from higher interest income on our cash balances as well as from forward contracts swapping some of our U.S. dollar debt to euro-denominated debt, which reduces our interest expense. Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the entire fiscal year 2019. First, let me share our business driver growth for the first three weeks of July, which are relatively consistent with the third quarter. Through July 21st, U.S. payments volume growth was 8% with U.S. credit growing 7% and debit over 9%. Processed transactions grew 11%, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 8% or over 9% excluding cross-border volume within Europe. Our fourth quarter outlook assumes growth trends across our key business drivers, in line with what we experienced in the third quarter. The exchange rate drag is expected to ease to 1.5 points on net revenues. Currency volatility will likely remain a significant headwind. The impact of pricing will be higher than Q3. Based on our current deal pipeline and the recognition of deals signed in this quarter, we expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenue to be 1.5 to 2 points higher than Q3. When you put all this together, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth to be moderately better than the third quarter. On the expense front, we continue to invest in our growth programs. Fourth quarter expense growth is likely to be in the mid to high single digit range. The fourth quarter will include a full quarter of expenses including integration costs and purchase accounting for Earthport and for Payworks, which closed last week. The exchange rate drag on EPS will ease to 2 points. We expect the acquisitions of Verifi and the tokenization business of Rambus to close during our fourth quarter. Depending on timing, they could add a small amount of revenue and 1 point to 2 points to our expense growth. When we report our fourth quarter results, we will quantify the revenue and EPS impact of all four acquisitions. We are updating our full-year fiscal year 2019 outlook, on net revenue growth, low double digits on a nominal basis with approximately 1.5 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact and over 1 percentage point of positive impact from the new revenue accounting standard. The change in the ASC-606 impact is driven by deals that were not anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the 21.5% to 22% range; expense growth in the low single digit decrease on a GAAP basis; and an approximately 10% increase adjusted for special items in fiscal 2018, including approximately 2.5 percentage-point increase from the new revenue accounting standard; effective tax rate in the 19.5% to 20% range; EPS growth low 20s on a GAAP nominal dollar basis, and mid to high teens on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis, including approximately 2 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact. We have several acquisitions that will be completed this year. As I mentioned earlier, we will quantify for you the revenue and EPS impact inclusive of integration costs and purchase accounting on our fourth quarter results. We will also give you our best estimates for the revenue and EPS impact of these acquisitions on fiscal year 2020 when we provide our 2020 outlook in October. In summary, business momentum accelerated in the third quarter. We exceeded our revenue and EPS expectations, despite strong headwinds from currencies. More importantly, we are substantially enhancing our capabilities through four acquisitions, new strategic partnerships and significant renewals of longstanding relationships with several key renewals and new deals to be executed in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest at a healthy clip to drive long-term growth and capture the extraordinary opportunities available to us to drive payments digitization globally. With that, I\u2019ll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: We are now ready to take questions, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJim Schneider: I was wondering if you could provide any more detail on the extension of the JPMorgan partnership. Whether there is any substantial change in the terms of that agreement outside of the length and in terms of the scope, anything that would show up in the economics of the business going forward? Any color around that would be very helpful. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Jim. We\u2019re obviously not going to discuss the details of it. I think, both companies are very satisfied with it. JPMorgan is a big and sophisticated issuer. And I think as I talked to the senior leadership team there, we thought it was a good idea to renew our deal and kind of focus on all the various things that are happening in payments and make sure that we weren\u2019t distracted by a negotiation that would happen over the next year or two. I\u2019m not going to add much more color than that.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. Look, it\u2019s great to hear the momentum in the pipeline on the wins and renewals, including obviously the JPM deal. It sounded like you were saying out that the win rate, especially in Europe, is stronger than before. And I guess, first of all, is there anything that\u2019s changed in terms of why you think you are winning at this rate? Is it actually better than it was before? And then, maybe just comment on even in the back of that how rebates and incentives, the guide is actually a little bit lower than it was before, despite these renewals in this pipeline? Thanks, guys.\nAl Kelly: I\u2019d say a couple of things, and I\u2019ll let Vasant talk a little bit about the incentive. First of all, in Europe, we\u2019re now on our front foot. We are past the integration. We\u2019ve got our management team in place. We\u2019re not all the way there, but we\u2019ve been moving more resources into the markets. And we\u2019ve been able to focus much more on running a very good commercial organization in Europe. And I think that it really is starting to pay dividends to be able to be not distracted by any of the integration activities. I think, the second thing that\u2019s happening in Europe but is also happening around the world is that we\u2019ve gotten our act together as it relates to FinTechs. I\u2019d be the first to admit, I think we were a little bit slow out of the chute a year and a half ago. But over the last five quarters or so, we\u2019ve been very, very focused on FinTechs and making sure that we are easy to do business with, easy to integrate with, easy to get on-boarded. And I think that FinTechs appreciate the various assets that Visa brings to the table from our global reach to our fabulous brand to a lot of our experience and capabilities and our scale. So, I think that those would be the two big factors that would come to mind for me when I think about your question about what is different recently. I don\u2019t know if Vasant wants to add to that or certainly talk about the client incentives.\nVasant Prabhu: I think on the client incentives front, there is a variety of reasons why they\u2019re running lower than we might have expected. Several items that are good things where some -- we make estimates on the terms under which deals might be renewed, and in some cases we haven\u2019t had to use up the incentives we thought we might have needed to when we sort of gave you a general view of things. So that\u2019s a good thing and that is actually permanent and continues. Secondly, volumes have been lower in some parts of the world and that does lead to lower incentives. Thirdly, exchange rates that impact the gross revenue line, as you know, help the incentive lines. So, to some degree that is reflected also when you do a year-over-year comparison. And then, as it relates to the wins, which we\u2019re very -- as we said, we\u2019re very happy about what has already happened, but we also have a very robust pipeline, many of which we will be able to tell you about next quarter, and a lot of that is incorporated into our outlook for the fourth quarter. Those wins, they play out over time. The volume comes in over time and the incentives will play out over time. So, you won\u2019t see the impacts right away. So, those are some of the reasons. And in terms of sort of the activity now and the things and their contribution to volume, as you know conversions take time, they play out over time. So, the volume will sort of layer in over a year or two. So, you won\u2019t see the full impact for at least a couple of years from things that we are winning right now.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good morning, guys. Question about the strategy, Al, that you talked about with the acquisitions of Earthport and Rambus, and some of the other organic investments. You\u2019ve highlighted that you are adding more of these network of network type of services that extend beyond the boundaries of VisaNet. Can you just talk a bit about this strategy more broadly, meaning like what market opportunity specifically are you going after, and is this sort of ancillary to the core business or do you expect it to become more core over time? And then, finally, how do you think about maintaining the quality of the Visa network and brand, as you sort of extend and expand into the sort of network of network model?\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Lisa. So, today, we process about three quarters of the transactions that have the Visa brand on the credential being used, whether it\u2019s a virtual credential or a real card. We recognize that there are other situations where we may not be able to process, whether it\u2019s a real-time payment network that a country decides to build out or a domestic card network, payments network that somebody decides to build out. And when we look at those kinds of networks, we see a lack of sophistication in some of the capabilities. And we believe that we have an opportunity to take our toolbox of capabilities and provide additional value to those networks, either on a licensing type basis or pay-as-you-go type basis. And I see it as very additive to our ability to grow the Company and grow revenue and be involved in as many transactions in some way, shape or form as we possibly can. In no way are we stepping back from continuing to invest in VisaNet. It is a very important asset for us. And we have a number of projects ongoing right now. And we will continue to make sure that VisaNet is the best possible network in the world in terms of capabilities and in terms of security and in terms of reliability, all of which are very, very important.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I mean, if you look at each of these -- you look at Verifi, it clearly enhances our network because we can streamline dispute resolution on our network, but it\u2019s also network agnostic. And therefore, we can help other networks also provide or streamline dispute resolution. And it not only takes a lot of the time and cost out of it, but is a much better consumer experience. So, there\u2019s value, both to our network as well as the ability to go beyond our network. If you look at Earthport, clearly that allows us to substantially enhance our reach. And to the extent that a portion of how we get the money from point A to point B might not be on our network, does not mean that it isn\u2019t a Visa-branded transaction with all the security reliability et cetera that our brand offers. And so, it allows us to be a network agnostic where it makes sense to be network agnostic in the interest of serving our customers. And then, if you go to Payworks, CyberSource now has a substantially enhanced capability to serve what is an incredibly high demand, which is merchants\u2019 desire to approach their business in a omnichannel kind of way where they can see the customer at the same time between both their online business and their in-store business. So, in every case, it enhances an existing business, but it also allows in every case the opportunity to extend our business beyond, let\u2019s say, our proprietary network.\nMike Milotich: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Al, just wanted to ask on Facebook\u2019s Libra. There is some confusion in the market on how to think about that. Is it a strategic partner for Visa or a potential disruptive threat? Just curious your thoughts and level of expected Visa involvement in Facebook Libra.\nAl Kelly: So, Bryan, the first thing I\u2019d say, I think it\u2019s important to understand the facts here and not any of us get out ahead of ourselves. So, we have signed a nonbinding letter of intent to join Libra. We\u2019re one of, I think it\u2019s 27 companies that have expressed that interest. So, no one has yet officially joined. We\u2019re in discussions, and our ultimate decision to join will be determined by a number of factors including obviously the ability of the association to satisfy all the requisite regulatory requirements. So, Bryan, in my estimation, it\u2019s really, really early days, and there\u2019s just a tremendous amount to be finalized. But obviously, given that we\u2019ve expressed interest, we actually believe we could be additive and helpful in the association.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you so much. Good to see the revenue acceleration. I wanted to ask also on M&A. So, you stepped up the number of deals, you said four. I think you did last year one deal. So, I\u2019m just curious, is the appetite for Visa to do more deals going forward. I\u2019m just curious if this is the maybe the new norm for deal activity. And separately, I just want to clarify, maybe with you, Vasant. Aside from FX accounting and the 606 accounting change and also tax, what\u2019s changed in your outlook, if you were to adjust for those items?\nAl Kelly: Let me handle the first part and then I\u2019ll let Vasant, Tien-Tsin, answer the question that\u2019s directed to him. No, we have not changed our posture as it relates to M&A. And the reality is, when we see an asset that we think is going to add value or bring incremental value for our clients or they are our customers or our investors, we\u2019re going to pursue it. This quarter simply was a much busier one in terms of deals closed or deals where we reached definitive agreements.\nVasant Prabhu: In terms of outlook, Tien-Tsin, if you look at our guidance for the full year, our net revenue growth, it\u2019s changed -- it\u2019s unchanged in the low double digits. The FX impact, as you saw, was about 0.5-point higher than we had expected at the beginning of the year. And the accounting impact is also 0.5-point higher roughly. So, it\u2019s sort of a wash. So, the underlying revenue trends, low double digits and generally as good as we thought as you saw somewhat better in the third quarter. Client incentives, as you pointed out, have come down for all the reasons we talked about. Expenses, higher than we had expected at the beginning of the year; some of it is the accounting impact going up a bit; some of it is we\u2019ve continued to invest at a healthy clip. Tax rates, slightly lower than what we expected at the start of the year. And net-net, I think our EPS is starting from the mid -- I think they were mid-teens when we started; now, we are mid to high teens. Other than the fact that the cross-border business started the year softer than we expected but has picked up well, the other big thing that has sort of been negative is the fact that currency volatility, as I pointed out, is now running in the last quarter at the lowest levels we\u2019ve seen in five years, and that has continued into the fourth quarter. But that\u2019s fine. I mean, as you can see, we\u2019ve absorbed it pretty well. If currency volatility had not been this low, clearly, our international revenue growth would have been higher. So, it did have a decent impact on our international revenue growth. But despite all that and despite the currency headwinds being as high as they\u2019ve been, we\u2019re delighted that our nominal dollar growth is going to be in the low double digits.\nMike Milotich: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Koning from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.\nDavid Koning: Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks. And I guess on days, I know, Q2 was a little light with Easter and processing days timing end of the quarter, Q3 picked up a little, and I think Q4 you actually get maybe another extra day. So, what I\u2019m wondering, you talked a little bit about U.S. decel through the first three weeks of July, and a little bit of transaction decel. But, do you actually pick back up because of the number of days in the quarter and get back to kind of more stable with fiscal Q3?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. In terms of processing days, the easiest way to explain it to you is, this quarter was a normal number of processing days, last quarter was below normal, and next quarter is above normal. So, you\u2019re right, because of the way this quarter ended and next quarter is going to end, it will help us processing days wise in the way that processing days hurt us last quarter. This quarter was more normal. And as it relates to the three weeks, we always tell people three weeks don\u2019t make a trend. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. I think, our outlook is that the trends will be roughly in line with the third quarter. So, if something is slightly higher, slightly lower in the first three weeks, I don\u2019t think it tells you much.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from our Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask about PSD2 the implementation deadline for Strong Customer Authentication this fall. So, my question is, how your thoughts evolving, and whether the current ecosystem in Europe is ready for this deadline, and what are the long-term benefits and trade-offs of this directive could be?\nAl Kelly: Harshita, how are you? It\u2019s -- you are absolutely right that we\u2019ve been engaged actively with European and certain nation authorities and trade associations throughout Europe to raise awareness that we think less than half of the merchants are going to be ready by the deadline, which is September 14th when Strong Customer Authentication is supposed to get into place. We\u2019re certainly pleased that the European Banking Authority had a recent opinion that\u2019s going to allow for extensions as set by the local regulators. And I think that most everybody is going to largely kind of look to the -- aside from people not being in compliance. It\u2019s our understanding that regulators in the UK and France, for example, have already communicated that they are not going enforce the September deadline. It would be very, very bad for particularly small merchants. So, there is a reluctance to move the deadline date. But I think where we\u2019re landing is that people will look past it and allow for exceptions for some time to come. In the meantime, we are working with merchants and issuers as much as we can to help them make sure they will be ready. We are also working on various solutions to help identify exempt to non-exempt transactions and trying to figure out how to optimize secure customer authentication. We\u2019ve got a Visa trusted listing capability, which allows consumers to identify merchants that frequently shop and therefore they trust them. There is a Visa delegated authorization that allows acquirers to identify merchants that already are performing strong authentication as spelled out in the regulation. So, there\u2019s any number of things we\u2019re doing to try to help merchants and issuers be ready. But, I think that this won\u2019t really come to the place where people will be required until we get well into 2020.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Questions on B2B Connect that recently joined -- launched it globally. I know it\u2019s early days, but I was hoping to get a couple of things answered. First, it seems you are finding now what\u2019s looking like holistic offering, based on your organic and inorganic investments in the ecosystem. So, is that a fair assessment? And if not, what parts need to be added? And secondly, can you comment on any early traction you might be seeing in this area?\nAl Kelly: It\u2019s just too early. We are just getting past the pilot stage. We\u2019re talking to various banks around the world about connecting. And I just don\u2019t expect to be able to share results probably for a good six months. I think it\u2019s going to take that long before we really see the traction with B2B Connect. So, there is still some technical work banks would have to do, and obviously still some sales work that has to be done to make sure that people understand the capability and what it can do.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now open.\nDavid Togut: Thanks. Good afternoon. Piggybacking a little bit on Ashwin\u2019s question, all three mega mergers this year in bank tech and payments have really highlight B2B payments as an important growth objective. And of course, you\u2019ve signed up FIS and Bottomline to B2B Connect and just closed Earthport. So, I\u2019m curious if you could expand upon your game plan, specifically to build out distribution into the enterprise B2B market, especially for cross-border, which you\u2019ve highlighted as a lucrative growth opportunity for Visa?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think, David, you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head. I mean, the enterprise level volume that has traditionally been wires and check. This is going to require a whole different approach than the approach in the carded area where we rely on issuers and we rely on P-cards and corporate cards and small business cards and virtual cards, in order to be successful. In the enterprise space, you\u2019ve got to be integrated into some of the large enterprise systems and you\u2019ve got to build a network of partners that have the ability to generate the kinds of distribution with credibility that we need. So, we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to build partnerships and look at investments, like the one we made in PayMate, and one that we made earlier in BillDesk. And we\u2019re going to continue to try to forge investments and distribution partnerships wherever we can because I think that\u2019s going to be a key to unlocking the volume in this -- the non-carded space of B2B.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I mean, our B2B strategy has many components and B2B Connect is one component. B2B Connect addresses, as you said, high-value transactions on a cross-border basis. Through Earthport and Visa Direct, we can address B2B transactions but low-value transactions that are high volume also on a cross-border basis. We also have initiatives that go beyond cross-border to domestic AR and AP. So, it\u2019s a broad range of things happening on multiple fronts. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about our partnerships with Billtrust and so on that deal with AR. We have other partnerships that deal with AP. So, it\u2019s a variety of initiatives on multiple fronts. As it relates to B2B Connect, since that was your question, we know that the value proposition is very strong. We bring settlement -- it addresses a whole bunch of pain points. We bring settlement capabilities, the security and reliability that doesn\u2019t exist today, we utilize distributed ledger technology, and we do tokenization to substantially enhance the security of the transaction. I think, as Al said earlier, with anything like B2B Connect, you have to get the network effect going. And that means having both ends represented at scale. That takes some time to develop, which is why as Al said, you have to wait for some time as we get both sides of the network pulled together and then the volumes build. We talked about that when we talked about contactless. There are two or three years where it all builds up and then it takes off. So, it will be some time before the network effect starts working for us in B2B Connect.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital. Your line is now open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. Good evening. I wanted to kind of just dovetail a little bit on all these discussions around these new payment flows globally. And the question is really twofold. One is, is there a need for investments, like sizable investments in the coming years to increase the scale opportunities for VisaNet? And then, secondly, Al, can you just talk a little bit about how you do think about security vulnerabilities, as you build out these networks? And your distribution points are clearly getting closer direct-to-consumer. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Dan, our new payment flows, clearly, there is always going to be investment to drive them to the level of scale that we won. I mean, in the last year plus, we\u2019ve greatly added to the resources in Visa Direct, which are all kinds of new payment flows into the various use cases that it\u2019s supporting. We\u2019ve obviously built out resources in the B2B business unit as we continue to explore that space. We\u2019ve got people. We\u2019ve had to add people to chase down all the various wallets that are out there in the world, not all of them with financial institutions, they are with all kinds of organizations like Gojek that I talked about in my remarks. So, I think from a technical standpoint -- I\u2019ll come to your security question in a second, from a technical standpoint, I think Visa Direct is, I\u2019m sorry VisaNet is able to handle these various use cases today. As we get into new ones, we may have to do some augmentation of VisaNet to make sure that we can handle a new use case that we might not have anticipated. But, I think, really the bigger challenge in the bigger area where we have to invest is simply getting feet on the street and getting people out there to understand what our capabilities are and realize that we could bring various solutions to them that they might not have anticipated. And clearly with the acquisitions and the nonbinding agreements that we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve got new capabilities that we can bring to our clients all the new around the world that we have to go communicate. So, that\u2019s where I think the preponderance of the investment will be. Security is something weighs on my mind all the time. We have an extraordinarily robust, and I\u2019m knocking wood as I say this, cybersecurity organization. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars. We have hundreds of people who work in the group. We\u2019re very conscious of anybody that -- any system or organization that in any way, shape or form is going to come anywhere near VisaNet, goes through incredible scrutiny in terms of their security. When we look at the acquisitions we\u2019re doing now, they will be integrated into VisaNet until we are completely and totally comfortable that we\u2019ve got their cybersecurity capabilities that where they need to be before we fully integrate them. So, you never know, the bad guys are continuing to invest as much as the good guys. And we got to stay out ahead of it. We got to remain vigilant. And it\u2019s something that we at Visa believe that security is a critical underpinning of the trust in the payment ecosystem. And given our place in that ecosystem, we believe we have obligation to stay vigilant in our cybersecurity. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re pushing tokenization, so that we can devalue data. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re building Consumer Transaction Controls. So, consumers can have a role in protecting their security and their data and the use of their payment credentials over time. And we will -- this is an area we\u2019ll continue to invest a lot of money in.\nMike Milotich: Jordan, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.\nJames Friedman: I just wanted to ask, Al, in your prepared remarks, you alluded to the used cases of tap-and-pay and the tax rate between transaction growth and volume growth, you referenced that 2.5 times accelerator in the UK. Is there anything unique about the UK market or do we think of that as a template of things to come? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Jamie, the only thing I can say and I think a bit unique or different about the UK market is that we have been in the transit system there for longer than we have in most other big markets around the world. And as I also said in my remarks, we are finding that transit is one of those things that really creates the habit and what people are commuting home -- to work and home 10 times a week, and they are tapping and get used to it. They realize and look to tap in all kinds of instances, particularly instances where heretofore they were using cash for lower ticket purchases. So, I think that as we continue to pursue the 200-plus transit projects that we have going on around the world, not certainly including the one I referenced in my remarks in terms of the MTA here in New York where we\u2019re seeing really nice results in just a kind of a seven-week period since we\u2019ve been up and running. I expect that in markets where we are able to penetrate the transit system and get high levels of adoption of tap-and-pay in general, I think, we\u2019ll see similar type of results. That said, we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out over time.\nMike Milotich: We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our Investor Relations team. Thanks again. And have a great day."}, {"symbol": "V", "quarter": 2, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-04-24 23:21:27", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Visa Fiscal Second Quarter 2019 earnings conference call. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Milotich, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.\nMike Milotich: Thanks Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Visa's fiscal second quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chief Executive Officer and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Mike, thank you and good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. First, a few highlights related to our financial results as Vasant will go into much more detail later. The company continued to perform well in the second fiscal quarter with approximately 47 billion transactions on the Visa network, driving $2.8 trillion in total volume. Revenue growth was over 8%, slowing versus last quarter as expected, due to 1.5 points of FX drag, lapping high currency volatility last year and slower cross border growth. This was in line with our expectations. Payment volume growth was 8% on a constant dollar basis, however, growth was 10%, excluding China, and the impact of processing days and US credit conversions. Growth in the US, the UK, and China drove most of the growth difference versus last quarter. As you saw in the numbers reported by the US banks over the last two weeks, processing days and the shift of Easter impacted the numbers. That said, volume growth in many markets around the world was still quite attractive. Growth in our CEMEA region was 22% and Latin America grew 14%. Also sub regions like India, Southeast Asia, Central Europe, and Eastern Europe all were growing at mid-teens or better. Process transaction growth was 11%, consistent with last quarter. Growth remained strong in our large tap to pay markets such as Australia, Canada, and the UK. Cross border growth on a constant dollar basis was 4%, slowing three percentage points from last quarter. Adjusting for the e-commerce platform reorienting acquiring within Europe for cross border to domestic and cryptocurrency purchases last year, growth was 6%. And growth improved moderately throughout the quarter. Expense growth was 7%, slowing to the mid-single digits as expected. Growth was primarily driven by personnel related additions focused on critical business building initiatives. EPS growth was 17%. When we look year to date, we've had strong performance posting 11% growth in revenue and 19% growth in EPS for the first half of the year. We remain focused on investing in multiple growth opportunities including strategies that both grow the overall pie for payments and funds transfer as well as enhance our capabilities to ensure we continue to be the preferred partner in payments. Examples include the embedding of these credentials into more transaction flows, including those with new partners in the B2B space, P2P, FinTech, digital bank, and wallet space, growing the reach of our digital offerings such as tokenization and cyber source and growing our capabilities in areas like risk management, fraud prevention, loyalty, and data products. Combining these solutions with one of the most recognized and strongest brands in the world is compelling for both existing and new partners. We continue to see tremendous long-term growth opportunities in many markets, including continental Europe, Africa, South America, Japan, Mexico, and many parts of Asia. Additionally, we continue expanding our footprint in both mature and emerging markets and we remain committed to growing access and acceptance until every business and every device in the world is enabled to send and receive funds via the Visa network. Without his backdrop, let me provide a few examples of the progress we made this last quarter. Let me start with Visa Direct where we continue to integrate Visa Direct into key verticals to enable new and enhance existing business models, including in the cross border remittance and P2P space, which represents a $6 million to $7 trillion market opportunity. We believe that Visa Direct provides capabilities superior to competing solutions, including pre authorization, real-time payment capability available 24/7, sending money to bank accounts as well as reloadable prepaid and credit credentials and scale to serve more than 150 countries with one systems integration, including cross border capabilities. These capabilities are enabled without consumers and businesses needing to share their bank account information with third parties for payments. For remittances, Visa Direct is one of the only cross border networks that is embedded AML and KYC controls framework and also provides real time in-flight sanction screening information, and clients value this assistance with their compliance efforts. We partnered with Remitly, a digital remittance company that transfers over 6 billion in annualized volume in fast growing regions including Africa, Asia, Central Europe, and South America. Remitly and Visa plan to provide customers with more optionality through the ability to seamlessly send cross border money transfers to recipients with a Visa credential. Similarly, we partnered with a company called EMQ, a leading cross border settlement network in Asia Pacific to offer cross border remittances across the region. On the P2P opportunity, Apple launched Visa Direct with Apple Pay Cash P2P service in the United States as part of their latest iOS release, which enables their user base to load funds, send money, and instantly withdraw funds using a Visa Debit credential. Apple's offering is the first US deployment of a tokenized Visa Direct solution and Visa Direct outpowers seven of the major mobile P2P programs in the United States. We also partnered with PayPal to expand withdrawal cash out capabilities from the PayPal Wallet in Canada. Another key area where we're expanding our reaches into B2B payment offerings across both core card and new payment flow solutions. Within our core card business, we continue to partner with established and emerging players to expand the usage of our solutions including virtual cards. For example, we are excited to have signed a deal with Sabre, a leading technology provider in the global travel industry, operating in 160 countries to enable virtual card payments in their B2B travel platform. Additionally, we have partnered with Divi in enabling and emerging FinTech that previously worked with a competitor to enable accounts payable, automation, and controls for small businesses in North America, again, through the use of Visa virtual cards. In new B2B payment flows, we're gearing up to launch B2B Connect in the coming weeks, which is our cross border supplier payments platform designed to simplify international B2B transactions through the use of a distributed ledger. FIS, a leading processor, has now signed up as a distribution partner, joining previously announced partners including Bottomline. Now let me turn and provide an update on a few regions where we see long-term growth and that would be Europe and India. In Europe, we see good momentum as we execute our growth plans. As you know, we are well ahead of our financial projections. We continue to believe that Europe represents excellent long-term growth opportunity for Visa. And we've already made a series of changes that we believe position us to take advantage of these opportunities. In Europe, today, our business is heavily concentrated in the UK and Ireland, which represent only 17% of personal consumption in Europe, but a significantly higher portion of these as payment volume today. And there were 12 other markets in Europe with over 200 billion and consumption expenditures. Of these markets, we are well positioned in some and have plenty of room to grow in others. In terms of the changes we made, it starts with people. Almost all of the leadership team is new since the acquisition of Visa Europe. As I said in a number of occasions, payments is a local business, and to that end, we have increased the number of customer facing employees in the markets by 70% since the acquisition. With VisaNet in place, we continue to increase adoption of our risk capabilities, including risk scoring services, customer alerts, and spending controls. And we are working closely with our clients to develop new authentication solutions that we think will make us a preferred partner to meet PSD2 authentication requirements without introducing new friction. And we expect to have pilots in market in the summer months. We're also rapidly growing our FinTech programs signing four FinTech this quarter, including Coinbase in the UK, which enables card holders to spend their cryptocurrency at any Visa accepting merchant using a Visa credential linked to their crypto account. As you all know, this is the long-cycle business with long-term contracts. As such, there'll be a lag until the results of our actions become evident, but I feel very good about the progress thus far. Now turning to India, we continue to focus on growing credentials and acceptance in store and online for both consumers and businesses. On the credential side, Visa continues to be the market leader in both credit and debit payment volume. We are further reinforced our leadership in credit and gained share in the calendar year 2018. The total acceptance points in India have expanded to over 4.5 billion, including over 1 million QR points as of February 2019. A few new developments to share. We are working with Paytm payments bank to offer our debit credential solutions to enhance their offerings to their rapidly expanding customer base. Paytm payment bank is also a new Visa acquirer and has launched contactless point of sale terminals for merchants who are new to card acceptance. Paytm plans to significantly grow India's POS acceptance infrastructure in the next few years which will certainly help power our growth in the market. We are also working on several new digital solutions for the market. We recently received the RBI\u2019s approval for our tokenization solution. This will enable us to use our taken solutions with global partners operating in India. We recently launched Visa Checkout experience into two factor authenticated mandated market. The Visa Checkout merchants are being set up in a way that makes for a smooth migration to secure remote commerce once it's available. India is a market where we're also piloting a network-based solution for installments on Visa debit. And finally, we're excited about the opportunities driven by our partnership and investment in field desk. Together, we will look to address ecommerce friction caused by two factor authentication through accelerated adoption of these digital products like Visa Checkout in the near term. We're also exploring innovative solutions including non-card payments and value-added services such as loyalty and installments. I'd like to now briefly touch on the expansion of our tokenization capabilities and reach in India and P2P with Apple. And let me expand on our broader tokenization efforts. We have enabled tokenization in 100 markets that cover over 90% of our global payments volume. With so much activity, there are a number of proven benefits to clients using tokens. We have seen increased security, a couple of percentage points, higher authorization rates and better conversion on payment transactions. Additionally, our card on file API allows issuers to make consumers aware of their tokenized Visa credentials and where they're stored on files, offering consumers much better visibility and control. And several large clients around the globe have enabled this service. In terms of secure remote commerce, we will expand tokenization as we roll out this standard later this year in an effort to improve security and reduce friction from digital payments. We expect to begin migrating Visa Checkout to this standard before the end of the summer, starting in the United States. The digital capabilities that we've been enabling over the past several years are recognized by our clients. In this quarter, we signed a long-term deal with Scotiabank in Mexico, where we are dramatically increasing our share of their business. This agreement centers around enabling new innovative payment technologies for Scotiabank Mexico's portfolio to improve the card holders experience while improving security and reliability. Similarly, we signed a new partnership agreement with HSBC, covering a combination of consumer and commercial payment portfolios in 27 countries across the globe. This agreement gives HSBC access to Visa\u2019s value-added services, including the Visa consulting and analytics global team and a number of portfolio enhancing projects are already underway. In Africa and Latin America, we partnered with Branch the most downloaded loaded financial app in Africa with 3 million users. Branch extends micro loans and disperses them into mobile money for cash out by recipients. With the funds being pushed to a Visa credential that sits on the phone, consumers will be able to shop online or in store or cash out funds at an ATM. As before, I'd like to provide a brief update on tap to pay, which is now 48% of domestic face to face transactions that run over our network excluding the United States. This is in line with the increases of a few points we have seen quarter over quarter for some time. In the last year, almost 50 countries have seen a 10-point or greater increase in tap to pay penetration of all domestic face to face transactions. And as you know, tap to pay is proven it can displace cash at a more rapid rate and one of the most effective ways to accelerate the shift from cash to card is to enable acceptance in everyday spent categories. To this end, over the last year alone, Visa has launched tap to pay transit solutions in 20 cities across 12 countries with more than 150 projects underway. In London, where tap to pay has been live for over four years, we have found that card holders that tap to ride a transit had a meaningful lift in overall card usage versus non-transit users. Before I close, let me briefly comment on a potential M&A deal and China. We are awaiting the final regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Earthport and we hope to close this quarter. Given this transaction is governed by the UK takeover code, we will not be able to take any questions on Earthport or the potential transaction. In China, we continue active dialogue with regulators and government to understand how to best move forward in the application process. But we have nothing new to share. In the meantime, we continue to expand our business in China, including our recent co-brand win with Carrefour, the third largest supermarket in China. In summary, we had a solid financial quarter and continue to deliver meaningful progress against strategic initiatives that will drive our future growth. We continue to strive to be the preferred partner by embedding Visa credentials in new payments, in new transaction flows, growing the reach of our digital capabilities and adding value to our clients through new innovative solutions. To share a little bit more on our second quarter results, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Despite some revenue and exchange rate headwinds, we delivered strong EPS growth of 17% in the second quarter. Net revenue grew a little over 8% as expected. Exchange rate shifts versus prior year were a drag on net revenue and EPS growth of approximately 1.5 points. Through the first half of fiscal year 2019, net revenue was up 11% and EPS up 19%. A few highlights, key business driver growth, payments volume, process transactions and cross border volume was generally in line with our expectations. The slowdown in payments volume growth to 8% was driven by four major factors, fewer processing days in the US, general weakness in the UK economy, continued run-off of dual branded cards in China, and the shift in the timing of Easter negatively impacted several key markets. Process transaction growth remained consistent with the last quarter at 11%. Adjusted for lapping the spike in cryptocurrency purchases last year and the e commerce platform reorienting acquiring within the EU, constant dollar cross border growth was 6%, in line with our expectations. The cross border growth trend has stabilized, moderately improving through the quarter. Net revenue growth was a little over 8%. As we had indicated last October, fiscal second quarter growth was impacted by two significant headwinds, exchange rates and the lapping of high currency volatility in the second quarter of last year. The drag from both exchange rates and currency volatility was actually higher than we had expected. Adjusted for these factors, net revenue growth was in the low double digits. Client incentives were better than expected due to lower incentives from some deals and programs than we had estimated, low volume in some markets and some deal delays. Delayed deals will now get done in the second half. Per the new accounting rules adopted in October, we are required to mark investments to market each quarter. Several private companies in which we have strategic investments had funding rounds or transactions this quarter that established a higher valuation. As such, we recorded investment gains of 84 million in non-operating income. We purchased 14 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $145.40 for $2 billion in the second fiscal quarter, including our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, returned approximately 2.6 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Turning now to our key business drivers. Payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 8%, credit was up 7%, debit was up 10%. Growth remained strong in most parts of the world with CEMEA growing 22%, Latin America 14%, Asia Pacific excluding China growing 10% and Europe excluding the UK growing 11%. US payments volume growth was 8%, about 2.5 points lower than last quarter. Approximately 1.5 points of the slowdown is driven by fewer processing days this quarter versus the prior quarter as well as the timing of Easter. Lower fuel prices contributed about half a point. Another half a point was driven by the lapping effects of tax reform, i.e., law withholdings last year and lower or delayed refunds this year, which mostly impacted debit. However, growth remained strong in debit at 10%, helped by Visa Direct. Credit grew 6% due to a full quarter impact from the Cabela's conversion, which started in the middle of the first quarter. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 9%. Growth in CEMEA remains robust at 22%, with strong growth across Russia, the Middle East and Africa. Latin America growth remained healthy. The timing of Easter negatively impacted several markets and Caribbean growth ticked down as it lapped the post hurricane reconstruction spike last year. While growth in the UK slowed two points this quarter due to weak economic conditions, the rest of Europe grew 11% with particular strength in Central and Eastern Europe. Asia Pacific growth, excluding China, was 10% and slowed about two points versus last quarter, in part due to lapping wins in Australia and New Zealand. China continues to be impacted by the runoff of dual branded card volumes. Process transaction growth of 11% is in line with the last quarter. Growth in the US slowed volumes. This was offered by the processing gains in Argentina which were at their full run rate by mid-January. Growth is also accelerating in markets where contactless penetration is rising, such as the UK and Canada. As expected, based on the trends we shared with you in January, cross border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 4% or 6%, adjusted for lapping the spike in cryptocurrency purchases last year and the e-commerce platform, reorienting acquiring within the EU. Growth improved moderately each month through the quarter. The cross border slowdown is largely driven by sluggish outbound commerce from countries whose currencies have materially weakened on a year-over-year basis. The Argentinean peso is down 49%, the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real are both down 14%, the Aussie dollar down 9%, the Euro down 8% and the pound down 7%, the Canadian dollar is down 5%. This has significantly impacted our largest corridor, US inbound commerce growth, which remains roughly flat. We\u2019re also lapping benefits from the Winter Olympics in Korea last year. Outbound commerce growth remains strong out of the US, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Inbound commerce growth remains robust to the UK and across Europe as well as into Canada, Mexico and Australia. A quick review of first quarter financial results. Net revenue grew 8% -- over 8% in line with our expectation. Growth was over 10%, excluding the 1.5 percentage point headwind from exchange rate shifts and the drag from lapping high currency volatility last year. The adoption of ASC-606 lifted revenue by 0.8 percentage points. Service revenue grew 7% in line with nominal payments volume growth last quarter. Data Processing revenues were up 14%, as we continue to benefit from pricing changes made last April. International revenue increased 3%, significant headwinds from exchange rates and currency volatility were partially offset by our fiscal year \u201818 pricing actions and a favorable mix, i.e., slower growth in intra EU volumes. Other revenues grew 42%, driven by the adoption of ASC 606 and increased client adoption of some of our value added services. Incentives, as a percentage of gross revenues at 21.2% are lower than our outlook range this quarter, but one point higher than last year. Incentives were lower than we expected due to lower than estimated incentives for some deals and programs, some delays and also due to lower volumes in some parts of the world. We expect to see an uptick in incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the remaining quarters based on the current pipeline and timing of deals. Operating expenses grew 7%, primarily driven by personnel costs and litigation provisions, partially offset by lower marketing. Personnel expenses grew 8%, driven by investments to support our key growth initiatives. We had a litigation provision of $22 million this quarter related to matters in the US and Europe. Marketing expenses were 8% lower than last year, as we lapped the 2018 Olympics, partially offset by increased expenses related to ASC-606. The adoption of ASC-606 added 2.8 points to our overall expense growth. What has traditionally been non-operating expense turned to non-operating income this quarter driven by three factors. The first and largest factor is that several private companies in which we have strategic investments had funding rounds of transactions this quarter that established a higher valuation, triggering the recording of investment gains of $84 million. This is a non-recurring benefit of course. Second, interest expense was lower due to forward contracts we entered into that swap some of our US dollar debt to euro denominated debt, both fixed and variable rate. These swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our US dollar denominated fixed rate payments into euro denominated fixed and floating rate payments, hedging some of our euro asset exposure and balancing our interest rate exposure, while at the same time, reducing our interest expenses due to low borrowing costs in Europe. This benefit will recur adjusted by exchange rate and interest rate differentials between the US and Europe. And finally, interest income on our cash balances increased due to higher interest rates. This benefit will also recur and start to move the interest rates. Our tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected at 19%, due to better than expected application of tax reform rules on foreign income related to FDII and GILTI. We expect our tax rate to be higher in the second half of the year. Moving now to our outlook for the third quarter and the rest of fiscal year 2019. First, let me share our business driver growth for the first three weeks of the third quarter. Through April 21, US payments volume growth was 12%, with US credit growing 10% and debit 13%. Process transactions grew 15%. Cross border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% or 9%, excluding intra Europe cross border transactions. All metrics are benefiting to some degree from the timing of Easter and are not indicative of our expectations for the full quarter. Our outlook for the second half assumes stable growth trends across our key business drivers, in line with what we experienced in the second quarter with a couple of adjustments. Payments volume growth adjusted for the processing days impact in the second quarter, a small increase in the cross border growth rate based on the improvement in monthly trends through the second quarter. As has been the case all year, the net revenue growth cadence from quarter to quarter will be impacted by year-over-year comparative impacts from exchange rates, currency volatility, pricing and incentives. In the third quarter, the exchange rate drag is expected to be the highest for the year at 200 basis points on net revenues and 300 basis points on EPS. Currency volatility will likely remain a significant headwind. We lapped last fiscal year \u201819 pricing actions and have a partial quarter benefit of fiscal year \u201819 pricing actions. Client incentives growth will be higher than the first half in the 22% to 23% range as a percentage of gross revenue. When you put all this together, we expect third quarter net revenue growth to be similar to moderately better than the second quarter. Third quarter expense growth will be in line with the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, based on current exchange rates, the currency translation drag eases to 100 basis points of net revenues and 150 basis points on EPS. We have a full quarter of benefit from the fiscal year \u201819 pricing actions. We also lapped higher client incentive levels from last year. All of this is expected to drive net revenue growth back up to the low double digit range. Expenses in the fourth quarter are expected to grow at the lowest rate for the year. We're updating a few components of our full year fiscal year 2019 outlook. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue will be in the 22% to 23% range for the second half of the year. But given results to date, we expect to be at the low end of the 22% to 23% range for the full year. We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 20%. Net revenue growth expectations remain unchanged at low double digits on a nominal basis, as do expense growth expectations in the mid-single digits. We're raising our EPS growth expectations to the high end of mid-teens on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis and the low-20s on a GAAP nominal dollar basis. The exchange rate drag on net revenue growth for the year will be over 100 basis points and almost 150 basis points on EPS. We\u2019ve had a strong first half of the year with 11% net revenue growth and 19% EPS growth despite higher than expected exchange rate headwinds and some slowdown in cross border volume growth. The first half demonstrates yet again the earning power of our business model. We remain focused on driving growth in our core payments business, while investing to develop new payments flows to sustain robust volume, revenue and profit growth well into the future. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: We're ready to take questions, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna.\nJamie Friedman: Hi, thank you and we appreciate the incremental disclosures, especially about Europe and India. I guess I'll ask my question about Europe. And that was really helpful that 17% observation. I guess my question is, are you closer to the beginning or middle or end of the pricing journey in Europe? Maybe if you could help us characterize that and update that will be helpful. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Jamie. I don't really want to get caught up in this game of where we are in pricing. Pricing is something we look at in the business on a continual basis. And we will continue to do that around the globe and in Europe. And it's a lever that we're well aware of and will continue to pull as we think the value that we deliver is commensurate with that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Al, I was hoping to ask you about the Japan market, actually not one that you did a deep dive into, but it's another one where there's a government imperative to drive up digital adoption, it\u2019s large, it\u2019s under penetrated, et cetera. And you've got kind of, you guys with your partnership with [indiscernible] but also players like Alipay Active. Can you just talk and comment on the competitive dynamics in that market, particularly around the use of like card funded wallets versus store balance wallets, QR codes versus tap and pay, et cetera.\nAl Kelly: Well, Japan is obviously a very exciting market and one where we are investing fairly heavily, given the fact that we're now, I guess, 15, 16, 17 months from the Tokyo Olympics and the government is using the Olympics as a platform to attempt to make sure that payments continue to grow and in fact, driving more payments to digital on a way from cash. So we are working with both the traditional banks and acquirers as well as new entrants there to try to embed ourselves into as many of the payment flows as we possibly can. We just did a deal with SMCC, one of the big acquirers there, where we're integrating cyber stores to help with build their capability that they offer to merchants relative to ecommerce and trying to improve reporting and reduce fraud. So it is \u2013 well, it was not a market I called out, it is certainly a market that we see a lot of potential in between now and the Olympic Games next July and August. But we also see Japan as a market that has an awful lot of downstream capability as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: And Al, when you talked about Europe, you mentioned kind of very heavy concentration in a couple of markets and then other markets where you've got opportunity, just talk a little bit about the plans to how to address that and are there countries or parts of Europe that that seem more, where that's going to be more conducive and talk about that a little bit.\nAl Kelly: I don't want to give away kind of specific plans by market. But I think that when we look at Europe, there's certainly a focus on trying to see where we can win a little bit more processing. In Europe, we're well established in the debit space, less well established in the credit space. So that's certainly an area of concentration for us. Fin-techs are very prevalent in Europe and Europe was, in fact, the first of the markets that we announced that we were going to get much more aggressive relative to fin-techs. Europe's a place that we're spending a lot of time thinking about transit. I mentioned transit in my remarks. I'm a huge believer and we're investing heavily behind transit and as you know, there's a very established rail and bus system throughout Europe, where transit, when people are commuting or using their product 10 times a week and that really builds the habit of using the card. So we're continuing to try to make sure that we're focusing on transit in several markets. I mentioned PSD2 and we're going to be coming out with a number of pilots of their different capabilities to help issuers throughout Europe who are kind of struggling with getting ready for meeting the requirements of PSD2 and we want to help them with capabilities to make that a bit easier for them. And then I would say Europe is a market where we're pushing hard on Visa Direct, and we see a lot of opportunity to build Visa Direct throughout Europe, particularly in some of the markets that are more inclined to move to digital. Europe's a mixed bag, you've got some countries that are still very, very heavily cash and then you've got some countries that are really have adapted digital. So those can be a number of the things Moshe that I would highlight as things that we're focused on in trying to drive volume, drive business and more volume in Europe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Keane from Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Keane: I wanted to just ask about on the incentives, I see that incentives are coming in a little bit lower and I know there's been some deal delays. Just trying to figure out, I saw the guidance overall a little bit lower, but just trying to figure out the latest update on incentives and how to think about modeling it going forward.\nAl Kelly: Well, I'll say a couple of things, Brian, and then Vasant can add. First of all, there are some big renewals that have already been occurred in the first half of the year. BBVA, Air Canada, cities, commercial business, [indiscernible] Russia, HSBC, SBI and ICICI in India and then I talked about Scotiabank in Mexico, there's some win back and early with early renewals. It was initially announced that we had lost the TFB debit business in the UK. But I'm very excited to share that we've retained that business and that will no longer be converting their UK debit portfolio. And the last point I'd make is that there were some smaller deals in Asia, CEMEA and Russia that have just been pushed to the second half of the year. So, those are a number of the factors that we -- that lead us to forecast a higher level of client incentives in the second half. Vasant, would you add anything?\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah, I think it's a couple of things again to highlight, which I mentioned in my comments. First of all, we make estimates about what incentives are going to be. And it's based on certain ideas on how things will renew and certain programs. We have that we often use incentives to get faster adoption of. Sometimes, we might provide incentives for contactless penetration, et cetera. So one of the reasons incentives is lower is permanent, which is why for the full year now, it will be at the low end of our range of 22 to 23. That's because some of these have come in lower than we expected. So, those are reductions and not delays. Yes, there are some low volumes in some markets. In terms of deals, as Al said, I mean, the second half has more of the larger deals that are likely to be, they're all going well and we expect them to be executed in the second half when the incentives get recognized. We had TFB as a win and that's the second half impact. We also have potentially another early renewal of a very large account that was not contemplated. But we're delighted to have early renewal and that will be a second half impact. So you should assume that our second half will be very much along the lines of what we told you, it will be in that range of 22% to 23% as a percent of gross revenues, and for the full year, it will be at the low end of that range.\nBrian Keane: Got it. Got it. And then just one follow up. I just wanted to ask on the difference, of course, between cross border volume. I think it was normalized about 6% in the international revenue growth through a 3%. Just that delta again, I know that comes up a lot with investors, maybe you can just help us through that?\nVasant Prabhu: No. I think it\u2019s important that people understand those delta. So let me give you a few things to help you with that. The biggest reason why revenue grew 11% last quarter, and is growing 3% this quarter, the biggest swing is the year-over-year impact of changes in currency volatility and their impact on our Treasury revenues. So Q1 this year, currency volatility was, in Q1, it was a significant tailwind for revenue growth on the international revenue line, because last year was a low volatility year in the first quarter, the currency volatility was, let's say, below the five year median. Due to this year, volatility was a significant headwind because volatility last year actually was quite high, above the five year median. So volatility this year was a little lower in the second quarter than the first quarter. But the comparisons to last year were quite significantly different. It went from being a tailwind to a headwind. That's one thing. The second thing is exchange rates are a drag on both quarters, but a larger drag on the second quarter. If you remember, Q2 last year was the high point for the strong dollar, so on a year-over-year comparative basis, exchange rates are a headwind in the first quarter but a bigger headwind in the second quarter. The pricing benefit is essentially the same between both quarters, we had a slight mix benefit in the second quarter because our intra EU volumes were growing slower than intra EU cross border volumes are growing slower than cross border volumes elsewhere. Another way to sort of simplify this for you and wash out some of these quarter-over-quarter things, is to sort of look at a two year stacked growth rate, which tells you that, not a whole lot has changed between the two quarters. So if you add the growth rate in Q1 last year, and the growth rate in Q1 this year in revenues, the stacked growth rate is 23%. If you look at our growth rate last year in revenues, on international revenues, and this year, and add the two in the second quarter, it's 22%. And when you do that kind of thing, it sort of washes out some of the quarter-over-quarter comparisons. So, that's where some of the noise is, there's no great change in the nature of the business. It\u2019s just these sort of year-over-year changes in a couple of different variables. One last thing I would give you is, last year, our volumes grew 10% in the first half roughly and our international revenues grew about 15%. The entire delta was an exchange rate tailwind because the rest of it was a wash. This year, our volumes grew between 5.5% and 6% in the first half, our revenue grew about 7%. In this case, most of the pricing is offset by FX drag. And the reason revenues are growing a little better than volumes is because the mix is a little better. So hopefully, this demystifies some of it. I know it's hard for you to figure all that from the outside, but the underlying trends are basically -- there's not a lot of confusion there. It's just some of these comparatives that are driving it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Cantwell from Guggenheim Securities.\nJeff Cantwell: If we look at your announcements today and really over the past few months, it seems like you're opening up your business very rapidly and in some interesting ways, so I know you can't comment on -- I'm not going to ask you about that. But I did notice a few industry announcements this quarter, one of which was with Coinbase. So, could you frame your expectations around that partnership for us in terms of how much you think it might be incremental to your rounds every time, it just seems pretty interesting to think about a crypto platform plus your network and how that could grow. So I just wanted to get framed out for us. And also I just have a second round related one as a follow up.\nAl Kelly: Look, we've been watching the whole crypto sets of developments around the world. And I think that this particular announcement with Coinbase, you get that some of the concerns that I think we've had and probably consumers have had, where not having the crypto tied to some kind of fee odd currency makes it challenging to figure out when to use it, when not to use it. And obviously it's difficult for merchants and there is not a lot of merchant acceptance. By Coinbase literally being able to, in this case, convert cryptocurrency to pound sterling in the UK. And then put whatever amount of pound sterling crypto now converted to pound sterling that people want on a Visa Debit Card allows a consumer to be able to use their Visa Debit Card anywhere Visa is accepted online or in a face to face situation. And they have the global acceptance of Visa and they understand exactly what they're paying for. So we'll see where it goes. We're intrigued because of the fact that it's a fairly large crypto player, looking at alternatives to have that crypto currency tied to an accepted market, currency. And that's what we find intriguing. And we'll continue to look for those opportunities around the world. To what degree this is a jumping off point, that other crypto players will copy, we\u2019ll see.\nJeff Cantwell: Thanks, I appreciate that. And just second related one, if we look at B2B specifically, this has sort of been under the radar, but blockchain world wire, which is part of IBM was recently launched. I'm just curious if you're looking at partnerships with non-traditional payment companies like IBM as a way of accelerating your share gains in areas like B2B payments in particular?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, B2B Connect, as you know, is based on a distributor ledger technology. So we are leveraging distributor ledgers already in the B2B space and B2B Connect is now ready for launch. It has got all the necessary approvals, it's got partners lined up, banks lined up, hopefully, when we talk again, B2B Connect will be live. We talked to everybody in the space. As you know, I mean, as Al said earlier, we\u2019re the network, we facilitate movement of processing transactions for anybody, we try not to pick winners and losers. And so we're quite open to partnering with all new models, not really figuring out ahead of time what's going to work or not. And we talked to all players, including people who want to use distributor ledger type technologies to do what they're trying to do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat: I want to ask about long term potential in cross border payments, you have a very strong and differentiated franchise and consumer to business cross border. And then now there are other areas in cross border, particularly in B2B and person to person, which have a lot of pain points in the market today. And over the last year, you appear to have doubled down in these flows with your investments and products, such is B2B Connect and Visa Direct. So my question is, if you can talk about how should we think about cross border payments and within that new payment flows, which is B2B dispersed and B2B in the long term for you?\nAl Kelly: Look, as I said in my opening remarks that getting into as many payment close as possible is a big objective of ours. And those -- that could be with traditional players or less traditional players, and obviously, as we try to get into those flows, cross border plays a big role. You look at the movement around the world toward putting new RTP systems in. Those RTP systems are in many ways kind of modernized APH systems that are focused on speed domestically, but they are domestic based networks and I think we have an opportunity to partner with those networks to kind of extend their reach beyond their borders. There are players that are focused, trying to make cross border payments easier around the world, we're certainly in discussions with as many of them as we possibly can. Our goal is to embed ourselves into as many payment and transaction transfer flows as possible with a unique eye on cross border because of our scale, our security, the number of countries in which we operate. And then we have the real test case or the real proven case of Visa Direct where we have a capability that is facilitating domestic and cross border transactions right now, and has all the advantages that I cited in my remarks at the beginning. Anything else you would add?\nVasant Prabhu: No. I think, I mean, the simple answer to your question is, we view P2P cross border and B2B cross border as significant, let's call it, expansion and new payment flow opportunities. And we're already in the business. You've heard us talk a lot about remittances in the last few calls, this call we talked about Remitly. We've talked about MoneyGram before, there are more in the works. The attraction we offer in remittances, for example, which is already a big business, is that we address KYC, AML and sanctions related issues on a real time basis, in addition to being far more convenient, and far more secure than an agent based approach to it. As Al said, I mean, Visa Direct is a big component to B2B also. Visa Direct is already in the business of facilitating B2B payments and B2B Connect then takes that to larger corporates and larger businesses on a global basis, as Visa Direct deals with it on a cross border -- provides cross border solutions for small and medium sized businesses. So this is clearly a central element of our future growth plans.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Al, let me get your thoughts on the recent consolidation in the US with large merchant acquirers joining the core bank processors, any implications for Visa since they touch both the merchant and the bank side separately?\nAl Kelly: Yeah, it's an interesting quarter with FIS-Worldpay, Fiserv-First Data and then you didn't necessarily refer to it, but BB&T and SunTrust announced merger as well. Look, let me direct your point to Fiserv World Pay. Fiserv-First Data, FIS-Worldpay. We've got very good relationships and a lot of history with all four of these players. And I think in many ways them coming together provides greater -- a smaller number of high scale players that will help us be able to distribute our capabilities through their distribution network. And that's a good thing. Both of these combined companies are very interested in one of their thesis ease of combining is to grow their global footprint, which is good for the payment ecosystem, because in a number of markets, the reality is that there just aren't enough merchant acquirers or issuer processors. So I think that's a good thing. And they're looking for our help. I've spent a significant amount of time talking to the CEOs of these companies over the course of the last three weeks, and they're extremely anxious to work with Visa and to help -- get our help in making sure that they do everything they can to achieve the synergies, revenue and expense that they talked about as well as talking to us about plans and how they can continue to grow their business going forward. So I think this is a good thing. And we're going to build upon the relationships that we have and help them. Since I brought it up, I\u2019ll comment quickly on BB&T and SunTrust, obviously still similarly, they've got to get through all of the approval processes, et cetera. We've enjoyed a good relationship with both institutions, BB&T is much more heavily a Visa bank, SunTrust more of a MasterCard bank. We expect to continue to do everything we can to serve both of them as clients, while they're still individual companies and we're going to do everything we can to obviously push to be their payments partner as they merge.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I wanted to make sure I understood some of the points that Vasant made on the revenue trends. I guess first, as far as pricing impacts are concerned for this fiscal year that are kicking in in April, is that a tailwind for the second half of this year? And then secondly, the FX trends now, you guys are using spot, not a depreciating dollar and then third, the Easter benefit quarter to date? Is there any way to quantify that and how we should think about how it might flow through for the rest of the quarter?\nVasant Prabhu: There were several questions there. Hopefully, Mike will remind me what all of them were.\nMike Milotich: Pricing effect.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. The first was pricing. So the way pricing works in the second half is, it will mostly impact the service revenue line and the international transactions line. Last year's pricing was most impactful on the data processing line. So we will start to lap pricing from last year. So you lose some of the benefit from the FY18 pricing, you get the benefit from the FY19 pricing, it's a little bit of a wash in the third quarter because you don't get a full quarter of FY19 pricing just based on some of the timing. It is a small net benefit in the fourth quarter. The pricing going in has a more positive impact than the pricing that is now being lapped. So that's sort of the best way to describe pricing. The second question was exchange rates, exchange rates, I mean, if you track where things are, I mean typically what we do, I mean, we don't know how to forecast rates any better than you can. But we do use forward curves and it's always what we've used for want of anything better. You can use spot rates or forward curves and you're going to be wrong both ways. So you should just assume we\u2019ve used forward curves, and on that basis, and again, the forward curves are not the reason necessarily why the FX impact is better in the fourth quarter. It's better mostly because last year, the dollar really started to weaken in the fourth quarter. I'm sorry, the dollar really started to weaken in the fourth quarter. So the comparisons become a little easier. So that's how we get to sort of a 200 basis point net revenue and 300 basis point EPS impact in the third quarter and meaningfully lower impact in the fourth quarter. And then the last question is around -- yeah, look, I think, the impact of Easter is not that easy to quantify. I mean, we do the best we can. And, we've given you sort of our best estimates, I think you should assume that there is some impact of Easter on the first three weeks. And regardless of what the Easter impact is, as we\u2019ve cautioned you, every time we give you these three week numbers is that three weeks don't make a trend. So you should just handle with care, as we say the three week numbers.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nRyan Cary: This is Ryan Cary on for Jason. I just wanted to ask about how you're seeing cross border volume growth going forward. Clearly, you got a nice recovery through the first three weeks of April. So is it fair to say growth bottomed out in this past quarter? Are there other variables you're keeping an eye on for declaring 2Q as the low watermark? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Well, as we said in the comments, when we talked to you last quarter, the trend was changing. And we told you we don't know if the trend is going to get worse, stay the same, get better. I think we can tell you that based on what we saw through the quarter, it definitely stabilized and definitely improved through the quarter. And, while there's some Easter impact, it looks to have improved again in April. So, I guess the verdict on where the cross border trend is, it's definitely stabilized and is improving. Whether it improves a lot or is roughly in this range, again, we can\u2019t give you that kind of thing. We\u2019ve assumed in the third quarter that the growth rate will be somewhat better than the second quarter, because we saw this improving trend.\nMike Milotich: And with that, just like to thank you all for joining today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to me either by phone or by email or our Investor Relations team. Thanks again and have a great day.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Milotich, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Visa's fiscal first quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chief Executive Officer and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR Web site. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's Web site and the Investor Relations section of our Web site. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everybody. Thanks for joining us today. Let me start with the financial results before sharing some key highlights for the quarter. The company continued to perform well in the fiscal quarter with approximately 50 billion transactions under Visa network, driving $2.9 trillion in total volume. Revenue growth was 13% and our key business drivers remain strong. Payment volume growth was 11% on a constant dollar basis. But please note that we modified our definition of payments volume this quarter to include all Visa directs use cases involving of Visa payment credentials. For your convenience, the historic growth rates have also been updated, and Vasant will touch on this in a little bit more detail. For us, order growth on a constant dollar basis was 7%, slowing 3 percentage points from last quarter. Adjusting for the cryptocurrency purchases last year and a major e-commerce platform localizing volume within Europe, growth flowed just 1 point. Cross border is an area we\u2019re watching closely. Cross broader volumes flowed through the quarter and into January, and Vasant will provide a little more color on these trends. Process transaction growth was 11%, down 1 percentage point from last quarter; expense growth was 17%, primarily driven by personnel and marketing-related expenses; and EPS growth was 21%. Let me briefly comment on holiday spending, starting in United States. Adjusting for Visa specific factors, spending during the holiday season in the United States was relatively strong. We've shown about the same growth we did last year, which was a strong year. Stronger debit spend growth was offset by weaker credit performance, which slowed later in the holiday season. Retail growth was in line with last year, fueled mostly by e-commerce. E-commerce continues to grow more than 3 times faster than non e-commerce. However, e-commerce growth did decelerate moderately versus last year. E-commerce drove approximately one third of consumer spending, up 2 percentage points versus last year. In terms of key gains for sales, Black Friday was the largest shopping day, boosted by almost half of the spend via e-commerce. Black Friday was the third largest e-commerce shopping day in the holiday season. Cyber Monday remains the largest email e-commerce shopping day and was the seventh largest shopping day overall in the holiday season. To give you a brief sense in the holiday and other major markets; Brazil and Australia saw a slightly stronger growth than last year; Canada's growth was similar to last year; and the growth in the UK slowed slightly. Reflecting on the quarter as well as the first few weeks of January, economic uncertainties related to the U.S. government shutdown, Brexit, Big equity market swings and the trade disputes in China are starting to have some impact on consumer spending. I was glad to see the reopening of the U.S. government last Friday after 35 days. It\u2019s critical that a deal gets done in this three week period as I fear a second shutdown would have a further negative impact on consumer confidence and in turn on the U.S economy. Despite all the uncertainty across the globe and the recent cross border slowdown, our business performed well this quarter and we remain confident in our business performance over the medium to long term. A corner stone of our long-term strategy is to deepen current client relationships and expand into new partnerships. In fact our performance is fueled by partnerships, whether it'd be our traditional financial institutions, FinTechs, commercial players, new payment flow partnerships or our sponsorship partners. As a B2B company with a great consumer brand, it is these partnerships that enable our continued growth and we\u2019re honored that company find value in the services Visa offers. So let me start by sharing a number of client partnership deals executed this quarter that highlight Visa as a preferred partner across traditional clients, co-brands and FinTechs. Let me begin with the traditional brand deals. In Mexico, we signed a five year renewal with BBVA Bancomer, strengthening our strategic partnership with the largest bank in Latin America outside of Brazil. In India, we continued to lead the credit card market. During the quarter, we renewed deals with SBI card and ICICI, two of India\u2019s largest credit issuers. In Australia, Visa will be the exclusive scheme for credit and debit card portfolios across Bank of Melbourne, Bank of Melbourne and Bank of Australia, which are all banks within the Westpac Group. Another great representation of partnerships and payments is demonstrated through our co-brand partnership. Co-brand partnerships bring together our merchants' brands as loyalty assets, and combine it with our payment network and our issuer partner assets. Across these types of partnerships, we had several wins in the quarter. We executed a long term partnership with Air Canada, which is the largest co-brand portfolio in Canada. In Mexico, Costco converted their private label card programs to be 100% Visa. Visa won the co-brand partnership with Amazon in India, which is expected to be one of the largest credit card portfolios in the country as it matures in the next few years. Lastly in Japan, we announced that LINE Pay co-brand card deal, which significantly expands the payment options for LINE Pay users. For those who may not be familiar, LINE is one of Asia's leading messaging platform and social network. Beyond co-brands, we continue to strengthen our projected footprint with our traditional acquiring and processing partnerships. Across India, we continue to work with local acquirers to expand access and strengthen consumer demand for electronic payment. To that end, we surpassed 1 million contacts with acceptance points in the quarter, and we now have 950,000 QR acceptance points. In China, we executed a three year deal with Mckayla, one of the China's leading integrated financial services platform to open-up acceptance at 7 million merchant locations. In terms of processing, we were in close collaboration with various players in the Argentina payments ecosystem to complete the processing transition to VisaNet earlier this month. And in fact on January 25th, Visa began processing 100% of our Argentine transactions, enabling us to better serve clients with our products and our value added services. Moving to new partnerships, FinTechs continue to be key enablers around the world in helping to extend access to electronic payments, open new acceptance, drive new payments flows and create new ways to pay and e-pay. Visa is increasing its reach and scope to address FinTech needs, both partnering directly with FinTechs, as well as platforms that service them. In Turkey, we are partnering with Turkcell and their FinTech subsidiary Paycell to expand access to digital payment services by offering a Visa card integrated with their mobile wallet, which will provide financial services, such as money transfer, utility bill payments and acceptance at the point of sales. The service is targeted at addressing the 40% of the Turkish population that is under bank with a goal of reaching $10 million Paycell Visa cards in three years. In Singapore, [Instram], a digital cross-border payments company powering local payments in over 55 countries will begin leveraging Visa's credentials for business and consumers by creating innovative products in payroll, travel and cross-border payments. In Africa, Flutterwave leveraged a suite of Visa capabilities, including digital prepaid card issuance, mobile payments, processing in Visa Direct to service both mobile money and bank clients. While Visa Direct has processed 100 million transactions across the 50 banking partners in Africa, it plans to grow across the continent reaching those who don\u2019t currently utilize electronic payment. Also in Africa, Visa is partnering with GTPay, a prepaid processor and program manager focused on prepaid issuing in over 30 African countries. This partnership will enable faster time to markets for FinTechs and wallets. Visa continues to also invest in partners to innovating and grow our B2B payment offerings across both core card and new payment flow solutions. In November, we announced our collaboration with Billtrust on their Bill Payment network designed to streamline the delivery of B2B payments to suppliers. The business payment network will provide financial institutions and corporate buyers with the ability to deliver digital payments directly to the suppliers' acceptance platforms. This collaboration reflect our increased focus on B2B accounts receivable and on improving the overall supplier experience when accepting B2B payments. We\u2019re also continuing to expand our commercial card relationships globally. In Europe, Ixaris will shift their business to Visa and expand the range of virtual travel payment products it offers to online travel aggregators, global distribution systems and other participants in the travel industry. Ixaris is a leading technology provider for online travel agency solutions in Europe, and we're working with them on expanding their solution set into multiple regions. We also renewed our Citi commercial card partnerships by seven years in Europe and five years in Central Europe, Middle East and Africa. In Brazil, Itau announced the launch of the Visa Infinite corporate card, Visa\u2019s premier and premium commercial product. Itau is targeting top tier executive clients who need a business solution with expanded benefits that are more in line with their corporate travel habits. In previous quarters, we provided an update on tap to pay, and we continue to see strong momentum with global contact list penetration of domestic face to face transactions. We've been constantly increasing and we continue to see 2% improvement quarter-over-quarter and an 8 point improvement year-over-year in the first quarter of '19, excluding the U.S. 44% of domestic face-to-face transactions that run over our network are now tap to pay. In the United States, our partners are beginning to establish the foundation that will drive adoption and usage in the coming quarters. U.S. financial institutions are starting to issue more tap to pay card. Chase, our largest issuer plans to be issuing tap to pay cards in all credit and debit portfolios by the end of 2019. Additionally, Wells Fargo and Bank of America will start issuing tap to pay cards this year. Wells Fargo will start in the upcoming months and Bank of American will begin in the summer. For merchant acceptance, Target enabled tap to pay this month and Hy-Vee, a large grocer in the mid west also enabled tap to pay. Visa Direct continues to expand use cases, geographies and usage by leveraging scale partners. Transaction count growth continues to be over 100%. Increasingly, large acquirers are seeing the value of offering Visa Direct. Notably, Visa is teamed up with Cielo, the largest acquirer in Latin America based in Brazil to start implementing real time disbursement capabilities to the Brazilian market. Once completed, they will be among the first to offer domestic originations. In Asia Pacific, ride or regional ride sharing app in Singapore started to offer driver disbursements facilitated through Stripe's Instant Payout feature. In emerging markets, push payments allow consumers to use their enabled mobile applications to push money to a business account, conveniently using an alias, for example, a QR or a phone number for the payment of goods and services. Scan to pay, Visa's QR based payment solution launched in Cambodia in December. The launch was done in conjunction with five of the leading banks in the country of Cambodia. Scan to pay also advised in Ghana with the commercial launch planned for Tanzania this quarter. These launches showcase that scan and pay is expanding into emerging markets of all sizes and regions. In terms of partnerships promoting our brand, we signed several partnerships to ensure our consumer brand remains healthy and top of mind. To that end, yesterday, we announced an extension of our 25 year relationship with the NFL by six years through the 2025 season. Our NFL sponsorship allows us to have tremendous reach to showcase our payment innovation across the United States for the benefit of our partners. This quarter, we also announced two new soccer partnerships, the Union of European Football Associations Women's football competitions through 2025 and the Confederation of African Football Total Africa Cup of Nations Tournament in 2019 and 2021. Similar to our other partnerships, we will leverage these partnerships to promote acceptance and showcase payments experiences at the tournament venues, and we will be able to share these rights with our clients. Before closing, I'd like to briefly comment on a potential M&A deal in China and an update on U.S. merchant litigation. Visa made an all-cash proposal to acquire Earthport in December 2018. As you are likely aware, MasterCard made an offer late last week that was a bit higher and we're considering our options. And our further announcements will be made in due of course. Given that this transaction is governed by the UK takeover code, we will not be able to take any questions on Earthport or the potential transaction. Relative to China, we filed Visa's domestic license application with the People's Bank in China last year, and we continue to work closely with the Chinese regulators and government to understand how to best proceed through the application promises. We realize there's been some recent market developments, but at this point, we can't comment on the structure of our China entity or potential partnerships given the sensitivity of the process. In the U.S. merchant interchange litigation, we're pleased to share that last week the district court granted us preliminary approval of the damages class settlement. In terms of what happens from here, U.S. merchants will receive legal notice of the settlement, and an opportunity to opt out, and the court scheduled a final approval hearing for November. In summary, we had a strong first quarter financially, it's important that the geopolitical challenges begin to get addressed, and we don\u2019t experience further erosion in consumer confidence that could impact cross-border spending as it has in recent weeks. That said, we have a very good business and we're committed to our strategy, continuing to invest in important growth initiatives. Through key sponsorships, we'll maintain our focus on strengthening our consumer brand. And together with strong partners, we continue to drive new payment flows, as well as expand electronic payment in the traditional consumer to merchant purchases. To share a bit more detail on our Q1 results, I'll turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. We had a strong start to our fiscal year 2019 with EPS growth of 21% and net revenue growth of 13%, exchange rate shift versus prior year but a drag on net revenue and EPS growth of approximately 50 basis points. A few points to note; as Visa business continues to evolve beyond purchases at merchants, we have updated our definition of reported payments volume to account for all new payment flows carrying the Visa brand. To-date, we had included funding or full payment volume related to Visa Direct, but not disbursement or push payment volume. Our payment volume now includes all Visa Direct disbursement volume. Where a transaction is processed straight through, i.e. it includes both a pull and a push in quick succession, the payments volumes is only counted once. All prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the updated definition. This change added a little over half a percentage point to reported payment volume growth in constant dollars this quarter. There is a schedule in the operational performance data that shows the impact from this change on current and prior periods. While growth rate flowed modestly from the prior quarter, payments volume and process transactions continued to grow at double-digit levels globally in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Cross-border growth rates, however, dipped to 7%. Lapping the spike in crypto currency purchases last year contributed 1 percentage point to the slowdown. The remaining two percentage point slowdown was within Europe or an intra-Europe cross-border transactions. These intra-Europe transactions have yields comparable to domestic transactions rather than a difficult cross-border transaction, hence a small revenue impact. One point of the intra-Europe slowdown reflected general weakness across the EU. The other point was due to a pan-European e-commerce platform reorienting acquiring across countries, converting transactions from cross-border to domestic, again, with minimal revenue impact to Visa. The Cross border gross trend slowed significantly in December and this has continued into January, which I will talk about more in a few minutes. Net revenue growth at 13% was very strong, helped by lower-than-expected client incentives. Visa timing moved some client incentives to the second quarter, shifting the equivalent to $0.01 in EPS between quarters. The new revenue accounting standard ASC 606 added approximately 1 percentage point to Q1 reported net revenue growth. The ASC 606 impact was larger this quarter than expected due to the timing of deals and client activities. The ASC 606 impact was partially offset by exchange rates, which were a 50 basis point drag. As expected, expense growth was in the mid teens. ASC 606 added almost 2.5 percentage points to expense growth. Exchange rate impact on some balance sheet items added another point. Expense growth rate was moderate in future quarters, and we still expect full year expenses to grow in the mid to high single-digits on an adjusted basis. During the quarter, the U.S. Treasury issued guidance on how to apply new provision of tax reform that go into effect this year. Applying these GILTI and FDII provisions resulted in a lower-than-expected tax rate this quarter. We bought 16.9 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $137.82 or $2.3 billion in the first fiscal quarter. Our board has authorized a new $0.85 billion share repurchase program, including this additional authorization, we currently have $9.8 billion available for share repurchases. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, we returned approximately $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Moving now to a review of the key business drivers in the first fiscal quarter. Payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 11%. As I mentioned earlier, the inclusion of disbursement of push payment volume added a little over half percentage point to reported growth. This reflects solid underlying growth globally, particularly in the debit business. Credit was up 9%, debit was up 13% in constant dollars. Latin America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific ex-China, all had stronger growth versus the last quarter. Europe and Canada slowed moderately, while U.S. growth decelerated by almost 2 percentage points. Total U.S. growth was almost 11%. Growth remains strong in debit at 13%. Debit growth was consistent with the last quarter both including and excluding Visa Direct disbursement volume. However, credit growth of around 9% slowed almost 3 percentage points versus last quarter. Credit growth slowed approximately 1 percentage point due to conversion, in particular, Cabela's, which started this quarter. Lower fuel prices contributed about half a point to the credit slowdown. The remaining credit deceleration was across multiple categories, particularly in travel and home improvement. Credit growth was particularly soft in the second half of December. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was stable at 11%. Growth rate stepped up in Brazil, Japan across most of EMEA and in many parts of Europe. This was offset by slower growth in Australia as we lap win, as well as the Middle-East, UK and France. The rate of decline in Chinese dual branded card volume was consistent with last quarter. Cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% and slowed through the quarter. This is 3 percentage points lower than last quarter, primarily due to the drive from lapping the spike in crypto currency purchases last year, as well as into Europe volume. Again, the inter Europe slowdown has only a minor effect on revenue. Excluding these two items, U.S. outbound spend accelerated as the dollar strengthened. Outbound spend also accelerated in Japan and the Middle-East but decelerated in Canada and Russia as the currency has weakened. In-bound commerce into U.S. flowed into the low single digit with the strengthening dollar. In-bound commerce into Europe remains strong and consistent with the last quarter. Growth in inbound spend to the Caribbean accelerated as we lap depressed growth last year due to the hurricane, which caused travelers to choose other destination. Process transaction growth of 11% is down 1 percentage point versus last year, mostly driven by the U.S. Growth in the U.S. slowed in line with credit volume. Growth slowed in Brazil as we lap processing wins, which is partially offset by the processing gains in Argentina. Growth also slowed in the UK consistent with the slowing spend growth, given the high levels of uncertainty as we approach the Brexit date in late March. A quick review of first quarter financial results. Net revenue grew 13%. As I mentioned earlier, net revenue growth benefited from delays in client deals. Exchange rate shifts lowered Q1 net revenue growth by 0.5 percentage points, which is offset by a 1 point benefit from the adoption of ASC 606. Service revenue grew 9% in line with nominal payments volume growth last quarter. Data processing revenues were up 15% as we continue to benefit from pricing changes made last year. International revenue increased 11%, benefiting from lapping low currency volatility last year. Also, as I described earlier, some of the cross-border deceleration in the first quarter was driven by slowing inter Europe volumes, which have only a small impact on international revenue. Other revenue grew 30%, primarily driven by the adoption of ASC 606, but also helped by increase client adoption of some of our value added services. Incentives as a percent of gross revenue at 20.9% are lower than our outlook range this quarter but in line with last year. Incentives were lower-than we expected, primarily due to deal delays but also due to low volumes in some parts of the world. We expect to see an uptick in incentives as a percent of gross revenue in the remaining quarters based on timing of deals. Operating expenses grew 17%, primarily driven by personnel and marketing costs. Personnel expenses were lower in the first quarter of last year as we ramped up investments through the year. In addition, we increased our 401(k) match in the U.S. and acquired Freedom in the second quarter last year. Marketing expenses grew 24%, of which approximately 13 percentage point is related to ASC 606. Marketing growth is lapping low first quarter spend in fiscal year '18, leading up to the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup. As I mentioned earlier, exchange rates impact on some balance sheet items contributed 1 percentage point to expense growth and ASC606 adoption added almost 2.5 points. Non-operating expenses were lower than expected due to higher interest income on our cash balances. In addition in the quarter, we entered into forward contracts, swapping some of our U.S dollar debt to euro denominated debt reducing interest expense. The euro forward contracts are a liability, partially offsetting foreign currency exposure from our euro denominated assets. Our tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected at 18%. During the quarter, the U.S. Treasury Department provided more clarity on the application of tax reform rule related to FDII and GILTI, which go into effect this year. This lowered first quarter tax rate by more than 1 point. With that, a few perspective about the second quarter and the rest of fiscal year 2019. First, let me share growth in our business for the first three weeks of this quarter. Through January 21st, U.S. payment volume growth was 10% with U.S credit growing 8% and debit 12%. Process transactions grew 12%. U.S. credit payments volume growth has recovered from the dip we saw in the second half of December. Cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 2%, which is similar to the trends we saw in December. Adjusted for the cryptocurrency spike and the impact of e-commerce platform shifting intra-Europe transactions to domestic, cross-border growth was around 6%, again, in line with the December trend. What are some of the factors driving this cross border slowdown? In the U.S. the inbound commerce growth rate is now negative. As the dollar strengthened in mid-2018 inbound commerce to the U.S. started to slow and this has continued. Commerce from Canada, Latin America, China, Australia and Europe, excluding the UK, has been particularly soft. Outbound commerce on the other hand continues to be very robust, helped of course by the strengthening dollar. Internationally, corridors that slowed significantly through December and January include outbound commerce from Canada, Mexico and Argentina, most parts of Asia, excluding Japan, Russia and sub-Saharan and Africa. Commerce into Brazil slowed sharply as is commerce into China. Growth within the EU is flowing as well as parts of the Middle East. In terms of the causes of the slowdown, exchange rate and the period of reduced cross-border activity appear to be the primary drivers. As always, there are some unique factors in specific corridors. It is too early to determine if this slowing trend will continue to stabilize or turnaround. For the moment, we're assuming the January cross-border growth rates will persist through the second quarter and possibly beyond. The impact of the crypto currency spike will faced through the second quarter. The impact of that EU platform shifting intra-Europe transactions to domestic will continue but it has a minor revenue impact. In October, when we provided our outlook for fiscal 2019, we have indicated that the cadence of net revenue growth would not be steady through the year. While our outlook for the year was for low double-digit net revenue growth, we anticipated high single-digit net revenue growth in the middle quarters with the lowest growth in the second quarter. This was driven by a variety of factors that impact year-over-year comparison like exchange rate shift, client incentive growth, and currency volatility trends. The second quarter of fiscal year 2018 benefited from a sharp weakening of the dollar, resulting in an exchange rate tailwind of approximately 1.5 percentage point and 11% cross-border growth. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we expect exchange rate to be a 1 percentage point drag, a 2.5 point swing year-over-year. The cross-border growth rate is in the lot of single-digit through the first three weeks of January. As I mentioned earlier, some incentives have shifted into Q2 from Q1 due to deal delays. In addition, the positive net revenue impact from adopting ASC 606 will be much lower in the second quarter than it was in the first. Based on current exchange rate, recent cross border trends and the other factors I just mentioned, Q2 net revenue growth is likely to be at least a point lower than we had accepted in October. Some caution is call for given the many un-resolved tissues that are coming to ahead in the second quarter; continued uncertainty over how to stand-off between the Presented and Congress is resolved over the next three weeks; the upcoming deadlines for China and U.S. tariffs on March 1st and Brexit on March 29th. There could be some volatility as we navigate through these complex issues and the uncertainty they create for businesses and consumers. We are maintaining our outlook for the full fiscal year at this point. We think it's too early to definitively conclude that a change in outlook has called for. We do think in the next several months could provide more clarity since many of the significant issues that have weighed on market for the past few weeks and months are coming to ahead. We hope as I'm sure you all do that these uncertainties are largely resolved by the time we talk to you again in April. We've had a strong start to the year with 13% net revenue growth and 21% EPS growth. As we have in the past, we'll love to pull all the levers we have available to deliver on the commitments we have made to you. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Vasant. We are ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from David Toget with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDavid Toget: Thank you. Appreciate all of the helpful call outs. Could you give us some sense of what some of the positive factors might be for the rest of the year with respect to cross-border? You've definitely called out all the risk factors. What could be possibly in the plus column?\nAl Kelly: We look at domestic volumes around the world in the last quarter, and they actually were quite good. Three of our regions had double-digit growth. And if you exclude China from Asia Pacific, it also grew double-digits. And Canada and Europe are about 8.5% growth. And domestic volume is seemly holding up quite well. Even in the U.S. where we saw some slow down in face to face retail and gas at the back end of quarter, categories like restaurant and QR continues to hold at very healthy level. So I think that, as Vasant said in his remarks, we\u2019re not exactly sure what the dynamic is with cross-border and whether -- and we practically don\u2019t have enough of a trend volume to really draw any conclusion. But we do think that underlying economics look pretty good, especially when looking domestic performance. But we do think that people have been spooked a bit by all of the different geopolitical factors that we discussed when you look at two of their largest economies in the world, the U.S and the UK, suffering through a shutdown and Brexit, that\u2019s got to add and he said it's for an ongoing period of time. It's got to have some impact on how people think about their travel outside of their domestic country.\nVasant Prabhu: I mean the other factor clearly as we've always said exchange rates matter a lot and clearly some stabilization or even weakening of the dollar would be a meaningful tailwind. You saw that last year, we had a weakening trend going into our second fiscal quarter, and we had a sizable impact on our cross border growth rate. So it\u2019s a combination of we think. Some of the uncertainty is that we're all coming to ahead in the next few weeks and at least recent trends in the dollar could be helpful as we look ahead. So we'll wait and see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I guess I got two questions on cross-border. One, that gap between the international revenues and the volume growth widened? Can you just call out what specifically that was, and whether or not it sustained sales over the next few quarters? And then secondly, as far as cross-border volume trends, has that ever shown to be an indicator of global macroeconomic trends. What leading indicator has that been by the data that you've seen? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: In terms of the 11% growth in international revenues relative to the cross border volumes you saw, it all depends on which corridors cross border trends are -- where are the strong corridors and the weaker corridors. As we said in the comments, some of that slowdown 2 points of it was all intra Europe, and in some cases it was linked to e-commerce platform reorienting acquiring. That while its affects we reported volume in that intra-Europe transactions that considered cross border for reporting purposes, the way the economics work from a revenue standpoint, doesn\u2019t really change very much. So those are relatively benign changes that don't have a revenue impact, that\u2019s one part of the reasons. The other is if you look at currency volatility last year in the first quarter versus this year, we did have relatively low volatility last year relative to this year, and that helped a bit in the first quarter. Volatility was higher in the second quarter last year, so it won't help as much in the second quarter. So those are some of the factors.\nAl Kelly: I would say there's a third factor, which is we said in our remarks that we saw the decline happened through the quarter. So they're at the beginning parts of the quarter. We saw a performance that was more similar and what we had been seeing in the prior quarter. So what we're calling out was a trend that we're starting to see towards the back end of the quarter, and into the first three weeks of January.\nVasant Prabhu: And there was a second question. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Around being the cross-border leading indicator?\nVasant Prabhu: As Al said, I mean the domestic volumes are quite robust as you saw, and even the three weeks in the U.S. after what was some softening in the second half of December recovered to if you adjust for conversions and gas prices very much to where they were in the first quarter. So there is no evidence in the domestic volume, the broader economic weakness. It is strictly right now in the cross-border trend. So I'm not sure we would be able to tell you that it is a leading indicator of anything other than perhaps uncertainty about certain more recent events that Al referred to.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nRyan Cary: I wanted to ask about how you were thinking about U.S. credit volume growth going forward. It sounds like growth moderated towards the end of the quarter. And while it seemed to recover a little bit through the first three weeks of January, it seems to still be a little bit below recent levels. Is there anything in particular to how you are thinking about it going forward for the rest of the quarter and maybe even beyond? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: The Cabela's conversion started to happen in the latter part of the first fiscal quarter. So if it looks lower than it does, you have to adjust it for conversion, which will impact the full quarter in the second quarter. If you adjust for conversions and you adjust for gas prices, or you leave gas prices in, because the effect is roughly the same as it was in the first fiscal quarter. We are pretty close to where we were running in the first fiscal quarter. So in that sense, the small reduction you see in the growth rate for the first three weeks is more linked to the impact of conversions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Just on the given what you talked, and thanks for all of that detail around the changes in consumer confidence. So I'm just curious is the defensiveness of the business is -- can you maybe update us on the ability for Visa and you're willing this maybe to protect the bottom line if macro does take a turn for the worst. I know that business has changed, your investments have changed, etcetera. I just want to know that if you could comment on it?\nAl Kelly: We will continue to do all we need to do to make sure that we are delivering for both -- for investors both in the year and the out years. So that certainly mean being very, very careful about as appropriate and as we see, whether this is a trend or it's not a trend or it reverses, we don't know. But we certainly do some sales tightening, but it would be balancing act, because it is important that we continue to invest in areas where we think we're going to get sustained good performance in the out year. So we absolutely will look at all of our investments and all of our expense lines to make sure that we\u2019re battening down the hatches where we need to. And I think if you go back historically and look at some past periods, we demonstrated our ability to do just that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nHarshita Rawat: My question is in B2B. So with the last year or so, your peers have accelerated your partnership and investments in the states of Billtrust, the Bottomline partnerships, B2B Connect rollout and your Virtual Card business still be growing very nicely. So my question is, what has changed in the market place and your approach to B2B in the last few years to trigger your investments in this space? And my follow up to that is, has this lead to the rethink of your strategy and buy versus build to grow after this enormous market?\nAlfred Kelly: I think what really more happened is that, we made a concerted effort, probably starting 18 months or so, now maybe a little bit longer than that to really double down and invest in B2B and really run as a business unit. We have a head of B2B as of 18 or so months ago that reports to Ryan McInerney, our President. We actually built in entire team, focused on it. We are fully confident and thinking about the three different segments that exit within B2B small businesses, big side business and large multi nations. As you know in this space, it is not homogenous. Each, industry vertical is different with different needs and we\u2019re increasingly conscious of that. We\u2019re certainly looking to build more partnership and I think that we made to your question around build versus buy. I think we\u2019re in the mode of -- we\u2019re very committed to this business and where we will look at every opportunity to both build, capabilities and products that we think our clients would value and that would help digitize more payments and move them away from cash and check and wire transfers. But we will also be both opportunistic as growth is pro active if necessary and looking at potential acquisitions.\nVasant Prabhu: As you know, there are new capabilities that Visa Direct has offered us that apply to the B2B space. There are new capabilities that B2B Connect offers us that we applying to B2B space. And then as Al said, some important partnership in the last few months has also added to our capabilities. So, it\u2019s a continuous focus that we had for a few years, but as technologies evolved our capabilities have expanded.\nOperator: Next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nLisa Ellis: I had a Visa Direct related question. I mean the growth rate there over a 100% is pretty extraordinary within Visa World, and I think we were looking at U.S debit volume as now sequentially accelerated for five straight quarters which I think is heavily Visa Direct driven. So just a more sort of strategic or positioning question, can you compare and confess the functionality of Visa Direct verses Fast ACH meeting in which ways is Visa Direct better or different? And what's prohibiting Visa Direct from being applied into used cases like bill pay or payroll or electronic checks that are heavily ACH today?\nAlfred Kelly: So Visa Bank, it will be -- now, Visa Direct is definitely going to contributing to debit growth in the U.S. and even outside of the U.S. Looks, it is not exactly the same as real time payments types of capabilities would probably two gaps. One is around the ability to reach as all bank accounts in the world. And the second is kind of the packet of information that's it travels with it. But Visa Direct is operational today, it can deliver most of that again cross-border transactions to this 2 billion Visa debit cards are around the world, and many of those are enabled for fed funds. It's global it's been able to over 70 countries and this last time we said Visa Direct and we send funds through Visa Direct over a 150 countries. Things like ACH are market specifics so somebody would have to stream together a group of countries at partnership for acquisitions, which certainly can be both tricky and time consuming. Visa Direct runs on as part of this and that sort of has the leverage of all of our AML KYC types of capabilities as well as our cyber security types of capabilities that were able to leverage all of that. So I'd say that Visa Direct is a great example of strategy to continue to improve and use VisaNet, our core authorizations process -- authorizations clearing and settlements, but that doesn\u2019t mean that as warranted, we will be looking to get involved in adding value and planning in the real time payments space as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Del Grosso with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nMike Del Grosso: Similar to the previous caller on Visa Direct, can you comment on some of the growth drivers and use cases within that? Is it still to P2P that's the predominant used case? Are you starting to see uptake in healthcare and disbursements et cetera?\nAlfred Kelly: So as a reminder, at least that as a moment, there is a number of used cases, P2P is one, disbursement is another. Bill pay is other and payments to largest is four. I think as we initially got into and powered things like Venmo and Square Cash and Zelle and other P2P platforms around the world. P2P was the first scale used case of Visa Direct, but increasing flushing this gig economy. There is a lot of applications that have been developed to facilitate end of shift, end of day, end of week kind of real-time payments to the people working in the gig economy. We're certainly seeing some growth in the Bill Pay and we've got a whole sales force out else looking for other used cases and signing of it partnership. So I think that as we continue on, you're going to have a wider range -- array, I should say of used cases that are contributing significant levels of growth to Visa Direct and we\u2019re continuing. We\u2019re already seeing that expansion and the growing of the breath of new stages for the product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is now open.\nDave Koning: Just two quick things. I guess cross-borders have slowdown in the last, I guess, few weeks and last quarter. Was at more travel related or was that more e-com? And then the second question, was the ASC 606 impacting the other revenue segment?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, the ASC 606 impact in total was about a point on revenue growth and the biggest chunk of it would be the other revenue line. That\u2019s where most of it should show up and then some of it on the incentives line. So it's mostly between the other revenue line and the incentives line. So, it's higher other revenue due to this and somewhat lower incentives because they are reclassified due to this and I explained most of it. In terms of the cross-border growth, we gave you a fair amount of color in the comments. And by and large, it\u2019s a cross-border segment but perhaps a little more on the face-to-face segment than in the card, not present segment. Other than that it's along the line of the things we described.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nCraig Maurer: Two quick questions. First, could you comment on corporate card or business spend, is that can be a leading indicator for the consumer economy? And secondly, what was the -- what is the specific capabilities you\u2019re targeting by going after Earthport? Just to understand what might or might not come Visa's way depending on actions you take?\nAlfred Kelly: Craig, on the latter as I said, given that we're governed by the U.K takeover code, we're just not able to response to any question or anything to do with Earthport at this point in time.\nVasant Prabhu: In terms of over card spend, at least first fiscal quarter, there were no indications in the corporate card spend to suggest a change in trend.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nBob Napoli: Question on just on cross-border and I guess the trends there and the battle I guess over your M&A offer to acquire Earthport and your competitor going after the same. What is -- are you seeing -- do you expect to see more market share shifts in cross-border? And are the stakes being raised from a technology perspective? What are you going after? What do you need to really build that business and make that a consistent growth business that's obviously a very profitable business for you?\nAlfred Kelly: Bob, I will just add through this, inside of more of a strategic level. The cross-border is important to us. We look at many partnerships and any at all technology that would where we can get value and participate in the movement of funds from one geography to another geography. So in short I would, I'd be safe to say that, we certainly wouldn\u2019t leave any rock unturned. And that said, we were doing that in Q1 of '18. We're going to do it in Q1 of '19 and we're going to do going forward. We did it in the last quarter. If that's all related to this very recent trend that we've seen in terms of cross-border performance, so we are not running through anything differently because of what we're seeing in terms of attacking and being committed to cross-border, nothing is going to change. But we saw the slowdown just as if it accelerates. There is nothing we would change. We would be continuing to be very, very focused on it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDon Fandetti: So, Vasant, on the '19 guidance for reve growth, I guess what's the most sort of important factor you are looking at? Is it the cross-border I mean your overall volumes were relatively solid? And are you -- do you have a little bit of wiggle room? How close are you -- can you just dig in a bit on that?\nVasant Prabhu: So I don\u2019t think there is much more we would add to what we said in the comments. We have started the year with 13% revenue growth and that was better than we might have expected. Yes, we've seen some cross-border slowdown in the last few weeks. It is, as we said in the comments, it's too early to tell whether this trend is going to moderate or turnaround. Fundamentally, all other dimensions of business really are tracking as we expected, when you look at same volumes transactions growth et cetera. There really wasn\u2019t any meaningful change in trend. So, based on all that, as we said in the comments, don't see any reasons to adjust our full-year outlook at this stage as again. The one change kind of been in one particular area and it's too early to know what happen there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Just a little more clarification on the spread between revenue growth and the volume growth in cross-border, I know you touched a bit on Europe being a contribution to that. I think you said it was couple of hundred basis points. Was there other variables on maybe pricing or anything else? And then just thinking about keeping that gap bridged going through the year assuming cross-border where to say and the range it is now on the revenue side, is that sustainable? And then actually just quickly on e-com contribution to cross-border today versus where it's been in the past?\nVasant Prabhu: In terms of the delta, I mean, they real move from quarter-to-quarter between volume and revenue growth. In terms of pricing, we told you what kind of pricing we are doing this year and most of the pricing will become effective in the second half of the year. So, yes, it will impact the international revenue line to some extent and that could have an impact in terms of the delta between volume growth reported and revenue growth reported. On the margin, levels of volatility, differences within one year to another would have some impact. The biggest impact really is which corridor is a most effective, which one is a strong, which one is weak. And all those factors go into whether as a delta between volume growth and of course exchange rate of course, big factor. You've seen areas there that gap is really widened one way or another if it anyone exchange rate, so of all the factors I mentioned exchange rates is probably the most significant variable that drives the difference between volume growth and revenue growth on the international revenue line.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJames Faucette: I wanted to ask a higher level question and that\u2019s around ongoing investment in FinTechs by some of the market participants from China et cetera. Have you seen any change or potential disruption from around the world in some of the places that AliPay and Tencent and another are investing, as they try to also get into the payments area outside of China? I know we heard about investment in places like India and Latin America et cetera. And so I\u2019m wondering, if you're seeing any change in opportunity set or competitive environment from that perspective?\nAlfred Kelly: I think, outside of China, I think it's early days to comment. And in fact as you probably know, there has been a lot of changes inside of China that both AliPay and WeChat obviously deal with in terms of the PBOC pretty much for description and on then forcing processing through a local Chinese switch. They're in fact making them hold to our capital related to the balances in the stage wallet. So they are putting some changes on the yield, they can offer under mutual fund. So, there is whole bunch of changes as they might be somewhat preoccupied with in terms of the deal with from a change prospective in China itself. That said, I still expect them to continue to look to grow outside of China mostly in Asia. I will tell you that our business in India was up over 30 points in the last quarter and we\u2019re continuing to -- we're continuing to be the market leaders in India. We're continuing to grow acceptance point, as you heard in my remarks, we saw, renewed two deals with two of the very large banks in India. So, certainly, we\u2019re very pleased with the fact that our business is still moving along and growing at a very healthy pace in one of the market that at least prevailing wisdom is. That is the target for basically FinTechs players AliPay and WeChat.\nMike Milotich: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Hey, Mike, thank you and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our fiscal 2020 started off very strong and this COVID-19 spread across the globe, certainly, our business was impacted. As a result, we were quite thoughtful during the year, adjusting our expenses, yet we continue to invest in key initiatives to support and fuel growth. Let me share a few highlights from fiscal 2020 that will illustrate our continued momentum. Over $185 billion payment transactions and almost $9 trillion of payment volume were made on Visa credentials. Acceptance points grew 16% to nearly 70 million merchant locations and that only counts our partners like PayPal, Square and Stripe as one each. Contactless penetration grew to 43% of all face-to-face transactions around the world, 65% excluding the United States. U.S. tap-to-pay cards reached $255 million and globally, they were 23 countries that increased their penetration by 25 points or more over fiscal 2019. We expanded wallet partnerships which now represent over $2 billion in potential credentials and nearly 70 million additional potential acceptance location. Globally, the number of active credentials in e-commerce excluding travel rose 14% since January, reinforcing the continued shift by consumers online shopping. We renewed about 25% of our payments volume in fiscal 2020 with key clients and secured several new wins, over 50% of Visa volume has now been renewed over the last two years. We expanded tokenization globally crossing the 1.4 billion tokens milestone and enabling over 8,300 issuers across 192 markets. Visa Direct grew to nearly 3.5 billion transactions utilizing 16 card-based networks, 65 domestic ACHs scheme, 7 RTPs scheme, and 5 payment gateways. More than 5,000 client users accessed over 450,000 reports for our Visa Analytics platform, a powerful application suite that delivers data driven insights and industry benchmarks. And finally, several large acquirers leveraged CyberSource's robust omnicommerce payments offerings to support their merchant customers with innovative capabilities. With that backdrop, today I'd like to first discuss our results, then I'll highlight some key client wins in the quarter and client momentum from recent deals contributing to our current performance across our three growth levers: consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Lastly, I'll provide a very brief initial thoughts on 2021. To start, our fourth quarter results, while the underlying business was in various stages of recovery, we saw the acceleration of cash digitization through debit, e-commerce and tap-to-pay and the penetration of new flows through Visa Direct. We also advanced our value-added services led by CyberSource, security and identity products, and our consulting. Payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volumes were all showed positive momentum exiting the quarter. From Q3 to Q4, payments volume improved 14 points, process transactions improved 16 points, and cross-border volume improved 5 points. Net revenues in fiscal fourth quarter were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 17% in constant dollars. The decrease in net revenue was approximately 11%, however, with service revenues recognized on a current quarter payments volume basis. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, a decrease of 23%. Given our strong ability to generate cash flow, we returned $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the fourth quarter. Now looking ahead, our strategic focus in 2021 remains the same. Accelerating our growth through consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all while fortifying the key foundation of our business model, our brand, security, technology and talent. In consumer payments, we've had success with traditional financial institutions, wallets and fintechs, as well as merchants. First, let me hone in on Europe, which is definitely been a key focus for us since the acquisition just over four years ago. Our first Visa client in Europe from 1974 Corner Banca in Switzerland renewed their credit relationship and extended into debit for the first time ever. In Denmark, Jyske Bank will migrate over 200,000 debit cards from a local card scheme to Visa in order to access Visa's risk, data and other value-added services. Last quarter, I spoke about our win of the UBS debit business and this quarter we also renewed the credit business as well. In the wallet space, Samsung Pay will put virtual Visa debit cards in all Samsung devices in Germany. For those issuers in Europe who want to offer a wallet solution to their customers without developing it themselves, we recently signed an agreement with the digital wallet company called Vipps. And wrapping up Europe with fintech progress, let me highlight global fintech Revolut, who chose us late last year to be their lead issuing partner. In 12 months, Revolut has issued nearly 7 million Visa credentials in over 34 markets with plan to expand more in the coming year. Let me now move to success with traditional FIs in other parts of the world. ING, one of the largest banks in Europe, recently expanded their long-term global partnership with Visa for their consumer and commercial cards in 12 countries across Europe, EMEA and Asia Pacific. In Asia Pacific, we renewed with one of the top five banks in China, Bank of Communications and we've strengthened our strategic partnership with Malaysia-based AmBank who will now become an exclusive Visa credit card issuer. In the United States, we recently won the inaugural debit card for markets by Goldman Sachs' digital checking account. With millions of customers, market has continues to create new products, create a full service digital bank and we're excited about the opportunity to help make checking with debit card functionality and attractive part of their growing product set. Also in the United States, we announced in the first quarter that we have secured the Venmo credit card and are pleased that it has started to rollout unlocking new ways for Venmo and its community of more than 60 million users to shop, share and split purchases, and our own custom automatic cash back everywhere Visa is accepted. Shopee, the leading e-commerce platform with a large user base in Southeast Asia and Taiwan is launching a Visa co-branded card across five Southeast Asian markets. And our traditional wins in the fourth quarter capped a successful year of renewals that went into effect with key partners, including Bank of America, Capital One, Barclays, Santander, [indiscernible] and Al Rajhi. Now let me turn to expanding access with digital wallets and FinTechs which are critical to growing credentials and acceptance globally. In the last 90 days, we signed multiple deals with digital wallets including Yandex in Russia, Wing in Cambodia, PAYCO in Korea, Naranja X in Argentina and Easypaisa in Pakistan. These wallets represent tens of millions of potential credentials. Our existing wallet relationships that continue to grow this year Rappi, Latin America's Super App with over 30 million users is now expanding into financial services with the new division Rappi Bank and it has chosen Visa as their exclusive network and payments provider. Rappi will leverage their deep knowledge in their existing nine markets to create new payment solutions that drive digital inclusion and cash digitization that not just for their users but also their [couriers] [ph], restaurant partners and small businesses. In Asia Pacific, in the last year, LINE Pay added one million credentials and now is approximately 3.5 million total Visa credentials across Taiwan and Japan. Our partnership with Paytm in India span both acquiring and issuing and this year the relationship resulted in approximately 80,000 incremental acceptance points and 1.4 million incremental credentials. We also see cash digitization opportunities with merchants providing payment services to their customers. Two to highlight from this quarter and they're both from Latin America. We're extending our partnership with Oxxo, the leading convenience chain with nearly 20,000 stores in Latin America as they establish a new FinTech arm. This business will exclusively issue Visa credentials in the Oxxo wallet and through their stores to further their reach of the under and unbanked. Visa also partnered with Natura and Company, the fourth largest beauty group in the world to enable financial and digital inclusion. Through a financial services platform, they're nearly 4 million direct selling consultant representatives in the region, who will be able to access a digital account of Visa credential and NAM NAM pass among other services. This progress in consumer payments is also prevalent in new flows as the pandemic is accelerating the migration to digital payments. Governments, merchants and consumers all seek fast, safe and secure ways to move money. Let's look at a few new flows, cross-border P2P is a Visa Direct use case with significant potential and we made meaningful progress this quarter. Ozone in Turkey plan to launch a global mobile remittance service in early 2021 for the underbanked and gig economy workers representing over a quarter of Turkey's 83 million population. In Russia, the VTB Bank, the second-largest bank in Russia with 15 million customers is utilizing Visa Direct for card-to-card transfers across 64 countries. Additionally, in Russia, KoronaPay, a leading remittance center - system, I'm sorry, will leverage Visa Direct for cross-border money movement. And TD Bank in Canada is offering their retail customers, our mobile platform for P2P with cross-border capability. Earned wage access and payroll or other use cases that are growing an important throughout the pandemic. This quarter, Wagestream the market leading earned wage access provider in Europe signed on to Visa Direct. Also in the two months, since with earned wage access U.S. provider Immediate launched Visa Direct as the payment option, the near real-time method is already accounting for 50% of Immediate's disbursements. And P&C in the U.S. is providing their commercial clients B2C disbursement solutions such as traditional payroll processing, another new flows with B2B which represents $120 trillion volume opportunity. On the card based, B2B front in the wake of COVID, we are seeing increased interest for digital payments including virtual cards. We are addressing this demand, by one, engaging with a broad range of issuers and partners, two, expanding into new verticals, and three, investing to streamline operations and enable acceptance. First, in terms of supporting issuance, Visa payables automation which enabled issuers to efficiently offer virtual cards to their corporate clients and sent back that said data back to the buyer to aid and reconciliation to an increase of issuers and partners in the platform by almost 50% in FY'20. Second, relative to expanding into new verticals, we are expanding partners and use cases for virtual cards beyond OTA. In Q4, we launched e-pay - we launched with e-pay in China to support a virtual card program involve OTA and education. We also announced the new set of solutions partnering with Stripe to enabled buyers to use virtual cards for payments and the initial user as a Citibank healthcare client. And third, investing to streamline operations and enable acceptance together with partners like Boost of FinTech focus and B2B payment acceptance. We are expanding commercial card adoption by streamlining the manual acceptance processes for suppliers enabling automated data reconciliation and offering flexible economics. And now let me turn to our third growth lever value-added services. Value-added services grew 15% in revenue in the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year, a testament to the resilience of this business as well as the demand from our clients for support. Often our value-added services are sold with a brand deal, but many times they're sold after or even on a standalone basis. Permanent TSB in Europe renew their credit and debit business earlier this year and subsequently signed an agreement with Visa to launch Visa transaction controls, which will provide a powerful convenient way for cardholders to track and manage all payments activity on enrolled accounts and tokens. In seller solutions, both merchants and acquirers of actively thought CyberSource's offering throughout the pandemic. CyberSource sales direct to merchant and also through robust and fast growing indirect channel with acquirers, who can leverage our platform to provide the latest digital capabilities in order to attract and maintain merchants. With that in mind, we are very pleased that Barclaycard, one of the largest acquirers in Europe will utilize CyberSource to support their merchant digital payment journeys, e-commerce and omni-channel requirements. We've also established relationships with acquirers in other regions. This quarter in SEMEA, we signed CyberSource deals with HBL the largest e-commerce acquirer in Pakistan, Equity Bank Group in sub-Saharan Africa and Bank of Abyssinia in Ethiopia. Before I close, a few words on the acquisition we announced yesterday. YellowPepper is a software company with a platform that we see as the universal adapted that allows clients to connect and scale new innovative capabilities without having to expend significant technology resources. Through a single API based connection issuers, processors and governments can access YellowPepper's rich set of APIs to initiate secure, real-time money movement transactions across a variety of payment rail using a simple alley like an email address or a phone number. For Visa, the acquisition extends to our network of network strategy by significantly reducing the time to market and cost for issuers and processers regardless of who owns or operates the payment rails. It supports our financial institutions in their quest to modernize the infrastructure and access network agnostic solutions and facilitate an easier - and it facilitates an easier integration to Visa Direct and Visa B2B Connect, which will help to grow new flows and transactions. It enables the further adoptions of value-added services both hours of Visa's as well as YellowPepper's. We're excited about the deal and we expect to close it in the next few weeks. In terms of Plaid, I want to say two things. First, we continue to engage with the Department of Justice on the review of the acquisition. Second, the Department of Justice's lawsuit yesterday against Visa and Bain & Company is related to a dispute over documents they requested as part of the review of the deal. Beyond that, we're not going to comment further. To close, this pandemic has touched all of us. Through it all, I think my resilience of our clients who worked hard to be there for their customers despite the many obstacles. I also have to pay tribute to the more than 20,000 extraordinary people who work at Visa. My colleagues have demonstrated dedication, creativity and professionalism in the face of extraordinary challenges. In 2021, we remain committed to making the changes necessary to ensure our organization better reflects the world in which we live and work. Visa is proud to lead, lend our support in the fight for racial and social justice within our four wall and beyond. In terms of 2021, Vasant will provide a good deal of detailed commentary. So let me just make a few brief points. In 2021, we'll continue to manage the business for the medium and long-term, we're recognizing the nearer term realities. This means: one, we will focus on the opportunities that are being accelerated by COVID-19. Two, we will continue to invest to grow our business and three, we will be thoughtful about controlling discretionary expenses. To be clear, while our business faces clear uncertainty we have too many attractive growth initiatives to pull back on the future. Our long-term strategy which recovered in depth just eight months ago at our Investor Day remains more relevant than ever. And I believe Visa has a tremendous opportunity to continue to trends, weaken transforming, secure, reliable and efficient money movement for everyone everywhere. With that, let me turn microphone over to Vasant Prabhu.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was the first quarter of recovery from the global shutdowns. I'll start with some high level observations on the trajectory of the recovery so far. First, the debit business has been the major beneficiary of the accelerated shift to e-commerce and the shift away from cash even for in-person transactions. In the U.S., debit is growing at twice the rate it was pre-COVID and international debit growth has stepped up from 11% to 13% pre-COVID to 17% in the fourth quarter. Debit stayed resilient through the shutdowns growing 8% in the U.S. in Q3, and declining only 3% in international markets. Debit growth was strong and stable through the fourth quarter. Second, credit was hit hard by the pandemic, declining 20% globally in Q3. However, credit has been recovering fast, exiting September, down only 5% in our major markets steady improvement through the quarter. Third, as economy is reopened, card present growth in major markets bounced back shortly from 44% decline in April to a 4% decline in September, a 40 point in recovery. Even as card present volume rebounded card-not-present growth remained robust. Card-not-present volume excluding travel grew 20% in April, 29% in May, and 33% in September. Consumers worldwide are sticking with habits formed during the shutdowns. Fourth, the cross-border recovery has been sluggish, since borders remains closed or there are significant impediments to crossing borders like quarantine and other such restrictions. From May through August, cross-border volumes were persistently down in the mid 40% range. September saw a 6 points recovery, which has continued into October. This recovery was driven by a few corridors, where travel is now relatively friction-less, like travel from the U.S. to Mexico and the Caribbean. Travel from and to the Persian Gulf States and travel to Turkey. The sharp recovery in these corridors provide some early indicators for how cross-border travel may recover and borders duly opened. And finally, the recovery so far has been uneven. V-shaped for domestic volumes, but L-shaped for cross-border volumes. The cross-border business remains a significant and continued drag on revenue growth. As a result, net revenue declined 17% in the fourth quarter approximately 11% when you adjust for the service fee lag. This is 10 points better than a similarly adjusted third quarter driven primarily by the domestic rebound. Moving now to a review of our key business drivers. In Q4, U.S. payments volume was up over 7% with consistent growth through the quarter. October volumes through the 21st, are up 9%. Debit was up 24% in Q4 and up 22% in October. Credit declined 7% improving through the quarter. In October, through the 21st, credit is declining 3%. Card-not-present volume excluding travel continue to grow over 30% in the quarter even as card present spending improved almost 2019 levels in September. A quick review of the recovery trend across spend categories in the U.S. As we did last quarter, we have three groups each accounting for about a third of our volume. The first group includes categories such as food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. These categories have consistently grown after above the pre-COVID growth rates in the high teens or even higher every week since mid-April. Through Q4, growth remained strong and stable. The second group includes categories such as automotive, retail services, department and apparel stores, which drop between 10% to 50% in April and have recovered to growth by the end of June. In the fourth quarter, these categories steadily improved and are generally back to pre-COVID growth rates. The third group includes categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic, travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants. These categories declined over 50% in April, improved 20 to 45 points through the third quarter, and adopt at least another 10 points with steady improvement every month. Travel is still declining over 40% in September, with the largest improvement so far in car rentals and travel services. Fuel is also still negative but recovered 20 points since June, driven both by gallons purchase and higher prices. Restaurant spending is almost back to 2019 levels. International payments volume grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 5% excluding China. A few regional highlights, SEMA remains our best performing region, growing 15% in constant dollars in the quarter, a 20 point improvement over Q3. The combination of easing COVID restrictions and client wins drove the strong growth. Europe improved 19 points over last quarter growing 9% in constant dollars, growth was strongest in the UK as well as Central and Eastern Europe. Fourth quarter growth in Europe benefited from UK cardholders utilizing their Visa credentials to move money into higher interest-bearing saving the funds. This is not expected to continue growing forward. Latin America also improved 19 points, growing 6% in constant dollars. Brazil spend growth was positive in the quarter, fueled by a steady recovery in face-to-face spending, very high e-commerce spending and client wins. Asia-Pacific declined 10% in constant dollars in Q4 or declined 4% excluding China, and a 11 point improvement since last quarter. China continues to be impacted by the run-off of dual branded cards that have a little revenue impact. There were more COVID-related restrictions in effect across Asia and other parts of the world. Korea, New Zealand are the exceptions, where spending is already above 2019 levels. Process transactions turned positive in the quarter, up 3% improving each month as a result of the domestic spending recovery. As you know, transaction sizes increased at the height of the pandemic, but customer behavior is starting to normalize. Process transactions growth in October through the 21st is 4% globally. Constant dollar cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe declined 41% in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we did start to see some improvement in September and through October led by card present spending in the few corridors, where there is less friction at the border. Cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe through October 21st declined 37%. Constant dollar cross-border volume including volume within Europe declined 29% in the quarter. It's important to remember that cross border volume, excluding volume within Europe drives our international fees. The trajectory of the recovery, where borders are now open provide some indication of how fast the cross-border business could rebound once most borders reopen. For example, travel from the U.S. to Mexico saw 40 point recovery from the trough in April through July, and the trend continue through the quarter. This corridor actually grew over 20% in constant dollars in September and October. Travel to Turkey, which opened in early August, improved almost 30 points in August itself and remained at that level in September. However, at this point borders remain largely closed. The World Tourism Organization reported in September that out of 217 countries, 161 countries or 74% still had complete or partial closure of their borders to foreign visitors. Of the remaining 56 countries, the majority are mandating COVID tests with quarantine. There are very few countries with no COVID restrictions. As a result, travel related spending remains depressed declining in the mid- to high-60s in Q4 and through October. Growth in cross-border e-commerce spend excluding travel and inter Europe volume has been consistently in the mid to high teens since mid-April, led by retail spending. Moving to fourth quarter financial results. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenues declined 17% on a nominal and constant dollar basis. Adjusted for the service fee lag, net revenues were down approximately 11%, a 10 point improvement from a similarly adjusted third quarter. This improvement was driven largely by the domestic spending recovery. Service revenues were down 13% driven by the 12% decline in nominal payments volume from the prior quarter. Data processing grew 4% with strong value-added services growth offset by the mix shifting the way from higher yielding cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 38% a few points better than cross-border volumes excluding inter-Europe due to some country mix and currency volatility benefits. Other revenues grew 5% led by value-added services but continue to be negatively impacted by declines in the usage of travel related card benefits and marketing services for clients. Overall, value-added services revenue grew 15% for the fourth quarter. Client incentives were 25% of gross revenues. This step up in the percentage was due to the revenue mix shift away from cross-border and the service fee lag, as well as the impacts of very significant renewal activity in this year. Client incentives were a little better than expected due to some deal timing and performance adjustments. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses declined 4% as expected, primarily driven by professional fees, G&A and marketing expenses. These expense reductions were achieved while sustaining investments in our longer term growth initiatives. Non-GAAP, non-operating expense was $126 million for the fiscal fourth quarter. Interest income fell through the quarter due to lower interest rates. Interest expense was higher from the August and April debt issuance. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.3%. GAAP EPS fell 28%, excluding special items non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, a decrease of 23%. On the fourth anniversary of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we had our first mandatory relieves assessment for the preferred B and C stock and released approximately $7.3 billion, giving preferred B and C shareholders the opportunity to sell these shares. This did not affect the fully diluted share count. A quick summary of fiscal year 2020 results. Payments volume increased 2% in constant dollars. Processed transactions grew 2%. Cross-border volumes were down 22%, excluding volume within Europe and 16% including Europe on a constant dollar basis. For the full year, net revenues decreased 4% in constant dollars. Client incentives were 23.4% of gross revenues. Operating expenses were down 3% on a GAAP basis and up 1% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP EPS decreased 8% while non-GAAP EPS of $5.04 was down 7% or 6% in constant dollars. The return $10.8 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 44.2 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $183.30 or $8.1 billion and by paying dividends of $2.7 billion. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2021, I'll start with a few general observations. Fiscal year 2020 with the year of two very distinct harms. The first quarter of fiscal year '20 had no COVID impact, net revenues grew almost 10%. Second quarter net revenues grew 6.6% with the COVID impact on our reported numbers mitigated by the quarter lag in service fees. In sharp contrast, net revenues dropped 17% in the second half. As we look ahead, it is important to remember that the first half of fiscal year '21 will lap relatively normal first half of fiscal year '20. Another important factor to highlight is the nature of the recovery we've had so far. Helped by the accelerated shift to e-commerce and the shift to digital payments, even in face-to-face transactions, the domestic business has experienced a V-shape recovery. Process transactions have largely tracked domestic payments volume growth with some impact from the mix shift to higher tickets, which appears to be normalizing. On the other hand, borders remain largely closed, or cross-border travel has significant friction in the form of quarantines or other requirements, resulting in a very slow recovery in cross-border travel. Also, the cross-border business comes at higher yields. This significant shift in mix is a drag on revenue growth, which will continue into fiscal year 2021 until the cross-border business recovers. Meanwhile, the pandemic is still with us. The environment remains uncertain. It is not possible to reliably forecast volume and revenue four quarters out. The significant uncertainties include the impact of spikes in COVID infections as we are seeing now, the timing reopening of borders, the easing of friction in crossing borders and its impact on cross-border travel recovery. The positive impact that improves therapeutics and a vaccine could have and all this. The timing and size of additional stimulus programs, the economic impact once various stimulus programs end. With that as context, I'll share a few perspective on fiscal year 2021 to try and be as helpful as we can be under the circumstances. On the revenue front, given how fiscal year 2020 played out, fiscal year 2021 we'll also be a year of two very different harms. Net revenue growth is expected to decline in the first half and rebound significantly in the second, with the highest growth in the fourth quarter. The level of the decline in the first half and the size of the recovery in the second will depend on how some of the unknowns I just enumerated play out. For example, this process transactions and cross-border travel - cross-border volume growth say at levels we have seen so far in October, through the first fiscal quarter, net revenue would be down in the high-single to low double-digit range. This includes a 1 to 1.5 point negative impact from the service fee lag. Through fiscal year '21, we expect Visa Direct to continue its robust growth trajectory. We also expect to value-added services to continue to grow in the mid teens. There is little in new pricing in fiscal year '21 but some benefit from pricing we delayed and some carryover pricing from fiscal year '20. On client incentives, we finished the fourth quarter of fiscal year '20 at 25%. There are several factors that will impact client incentives in fiscal year '21. First mix, incentives are tied more to domestic volumes than they are to cross-border volumes. The current mix shift away from cross-border curse gross revenues and causes this ratio to increase. When the mix normalizes, this will push the ratio down again. Second performance, in fiscal year '20 with a sharp decline in volumes, many clients did not meet certain volumes thresholds. And as such, did not earn corresponding incentives. As volume recovers in fiscal year '21, we expect clients will take special and on these incentives, which causes a year-over-year increase unique to the year over recovery. Finally, the impact of renewals, as we have told you fiscal year '20 was another big year for client renewals. We renewed 25% of our volume during the year with another 15% to 20% likely renewed in fiscal year '21. Factoring all this in, we currently estimate that fiscal year '21 incentives as a percent of gross revenue could be in the 25.5% to 26.5% range. As always we've given you our best sense of the range at this point and will update you through the year as we learn more. First quarter incentives are likely to be at the lower end of the range. Moving to operating expenses, in fiscal year '20, we demonstrated our ability to modulate expenses and investments as circumstances change, balancing short term imperatives with long-term priorities. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 8% in the first half and declined 5% in the second. As Al indicated, we remain very bullish about the growth potential of our business and we'll invest accordingly. Visa Direct continues its robust growth, B2B Connect is ram ping, our value-added services growth is sustaining at mid-teens levels and our recent acquisitions required investments to scale. We will step up investment in all these areas and a few others such as the Tokyo Olympics. As a result, we plan to increase our level of investment through the year modulating as we learn more about the trajectory of the recovery. Our current plan is for expenses to be down in the first quarter, in line with second half fiscal year '20 trends. Expenses are expected to grow in the mid-single digits in the second quarter as we begin to lap the expense pullbacks from the last fiscal year. At this point, we plan on double-digit expense growth in the second half, in part due to the Olympics. However, we will adjust our plans as needed and update you as the year progresses. We expect non-operating expense to average $145 million to $150 million each quarter in fiscal year '21 for two primary reasons. First, low and even negative interest rates on our cash balances, and two, our $4 billion in additional debt after we pay off our December bond maturities. Our fiscal year '21 tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range. It is too early to predict what impact the U.S. elections will have on our taxes. As always, we will provide updates if any to our tax rate expectations as the year progresses. Capital spending in fiscal year '21 is likely to be around $700 million. We expect to return most of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Our Board of Directors has authorized an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.32, starting in the first quarter of fiscal year '21. Then the flat transaction closes, we will let you know what is impact on FY '21 will be. In summary, as we've done in fiscal year 2020, we will stay flexible and agile as we work through the pandemic. As you heard from Al, the opportunity ahead is lost. The shift to e-commerce and away from cash is accelerating. Use cases for new payment flows are proliferating and ramping. Our value-added services business continues to grow at a healthy clip. We remain as optimistic about our future, as we were at our Investor Day in February, which now seems like a lifetime ago. Our strategy remains unchanged and in fiscal year '21, we will continue to prioritize and invest in our key growth initiatives. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Vasant. We will run a little long in order to ensure we have enough time for questions. So with that, we're ready to get started, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Thank you for taking my question. YellowPepper, can you give us little more color you [technical difficulty] mentioned money with email or anything like that that you could highlight in terms of the advantages of YellowPepper? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: This is a company that we're quite familiar with, we invest - we were an early investor with them, we've been working with them, what they really are - they'll allow various players throughout, at least in the foreseeable future through Latin America being able to facilitate getting any kinds of - various kinds of services up and going very quickly by connecting to YellowPepper. And then YellowPepper taking over from there. And we think as the payments of money movement world continues to grow and diversify, having a software platform like YellowPepper that makes it easier for these connections to happen and gives us an on-ramp to sell value-added services and accommodate the needs of various clients to have network agnostic solutions that it's going to give us a good path towards accelerating both core payments as well as value-added services and new flows throughout Latin America. And then over time, we will look to extend the capability beyond that region.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line is open.\nBob Napoli: Just on the value-added services, I was hoping to get a little more color on kind of the mix of the revenue that could kind of break it out by - whatever reasonable products you could have done and if which of those products are growing the fastest [indiscernible] Visa Direct?\nAl Kelly: Well, Bob, thank you for the question. So first of all, we think of Visa Direct as a new flow not evaluated.\nBob Napoli: Okay. Sure.\nAl Kelly: So let me try to get a little more color. So about 2/3 of value-added services are platform type of services that are driven by transactions. And obviously, in this environment some of those have done quite well. CyberSource, where people are looking for omni-channel solutions, risk and fraud services, particularly as lot more transactions have gone online and people looking at things like 3-D Secure at 2.0 and our offering from CardinalCommerce and then issuer processing has done well given that what's happening with debit, as Vasant described in his remarks. About other the 1/3 - so that's about 2/3 of value-added services, the other 1/3 is kind of split between service revenue and other revenue. So in service revenue, you have card benefits, which are offered as a package. And then in other revenue you have services that are generally not tied to volumes, things like travel-related card benefits, marketing services, data and consulting and analytics. So you can imagine in that grouping, there are things that are struggling a little bit and other things that are accelerating. So travel-related card benefits are obviously very sluggish as our marketing services, but things like data and consulting and analytics are continuing to grow at a pretty robust levels. So that would be hopefully give you some color. I don't know, Vasant whether you want to add anything to that.\nVasant Prabhu: No. I think we're very pleased with how as Al said the platform-based services are growing those happen to be the ones that have the best margins and it's things like our fraud services, authentication, through CardinalCommerce as well as, as Al said CyberSource, clearly the growth of omni-commerce and certainly everybody - every merchant wanting to enhance the e-commerce business is very helpful to CyberSource, which as you know is a gateway for most e-commerce merchants. And then with debit doing well, the debit processing business. So those platform-services most of it show up in our data processing line from a revenue standpoint, particularly high growth right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: I just want to ask you about the strength in debit, obviously, even without stimulus the growth continues to be impressive well above 20%, especially in the U.S. and then obviously picking up internationally. How much of that is driven by this move towards contact with an e-comm and as we get into next year, does it cause a difficult comp, just because of the growth rate is so much higher than traditional or does this growth continue at these rates and maybe somewhat offset by a pickup in credit by the time we get to the second half of next year? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Bryan. I'd say, there is a number of drivers that what's happening with debit, certainly, I think an acceleration of cash displacement at the point of sale, where people are just concerned about cash being a carrier of germs, I see that, I think that trend continues. Certainly, a significant shift online purchases and mostly in everyday spend categories which kind of favors debit a bit. I think that's going to stay up a fairly healthy level. Thirdly, what we've learned in the past and it's being reinforced now is that in these uncertain economic times, people probably would prefer to spend the money they have been than they borrow the money and hence that's a positive driver for debit. And then Visa Direct, obviously, helps drive our debit performance as well. I expect that a lot of this positive momentum will continue, but I think there's no question that, if and let's hope it does, the world gets back to normal quicker than many would might predict, that a, you will see credit come back as - as more discretionary purchases and travel start to bounce back. And maybe some purchases start to move that are online maybe move back into the face-to-face world. But I think a lot of people have gotten very comfortable sitting out there, dining room table or in their home office, shopping on online on e-commerce. So I think a lot of these drivers of what we're seeing in debit over the last six months have some staying power to them.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I mean, I\u2019ll add a couple of things. And you can see it in some of the charts, we provided on the weekly trends. I think what's happening about debit, which as I said in my comments is the biggest beneficiary of the accelerated growth of e-commerce and the shift away from cash. The two things, we are seeing is that even this credit has recovered from declining 20% in April to exiting September down only about 5% I believe if I remember right, in the major markets. You see the credit line, the debit line has been very steady. It's been growing at the same rate without really being impacted by the recovery of credit and even as card present trends have improved you're seeing the debit line hold steady. So a lot of it has to be driven by the new cases, we are enabling a new payment flows through Visa Direct, as Al said. And also the fact that, there has been a true shift away from cash and most of it has gone to debit. Now clearly some of it is the stimulus payments and if you don't have them next year clearly some of that spending - may have been spending that may not sustained but that remains to be seen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I wanted to sort of follow-up on exactly what you were talking about, Vasant, obviously there is a recovery underway, but to the extent that stimulus isn't renewed and I know that means may or may not happen. And then you have - you're going into the winter months where it may be more difficult to travel or as such. Do you feel like that's a risk to the growth trajectory of the volumes and then just a clarification on the incentive guidance, the volume and support guidance. And does that include the numbers you gave an impact from the lag of the volumes that come back versus what you're paying out? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: I'm not sure fully understood your second question. But I will try to answer it. On the first one, as we said, we live in uncertain times and it's difficult to hazard guesses on what's going to happen when if there are spikes in infections. I would say, we are tracking it very closely, and there really two things to track, its spikes in infections and then what is the response from the government? To the extent that the response from the government is to impose restrictions and shutdown, then it does have effects on spending. If the response of the government is to largely keep things open then we see less of an impact. So it will be very different region by region and country by country, both linked to the infection rate as well as the governmental response. As it relates to travel, travel habits are changing, as you saw, I mean people can't go everywhere. So corridors that are open are getting more of the travel, which is why you saw the Caribbean and Mexico are actually growing in September and October. And normally September and October, after schools open tends to be a slowdown in travel in fact we are seeing travel continue, personnel travel continue into September and October in the corridors that are open. So what you may see in terms of travel is, people really being quite astute about where they can travel and as certain corridors open up, you start to see travel moving into those corridor that may have gone elsewhere. So it all makes it very difficult to make any hard predictions about what's going to happen next. As far as your incentives question, I wasn't sure what the question was, exactly, but we've tried to factor in everything we know right now, mix shift from cross-border, service fee lag, the renewals we already had and what we might expect to give you the best range we can. We will obviously give you an update as the year goes by.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: You called out a lot of new partnerships and agreements this quarter, Al, in your prepared remarks and I'm just wondering in the context of the pandemic, have the way you structured the agreement changed at all or incentive levels, less performance-based or is there any kind of changes that might have an impact on the way incentives just kind of come in down the road in terms of how you're negotiating right now?\nAl Kelly: We will ramp - as a general, I'd say there really hasn't been a lot of change. I think that they've generally been fairly similar. I think that for the most part, I think most - as you know, most of these deals are five, seven, sub-type longer years in duration and I think almost everybody thinks that we're looking at a kind of a once in a century-type of event here. The conversation, Sanjay, Vasant was just having we're not sure how long that really last, but we're certainly not looking for it to last through the duration of what these contracts are? I think that said, we're certainly thinking about the structure of deals and trying to determine where to tweak things here and there, but I wouldn't say that we've made any kind of radical changes to how we're restructuring the deals ramping.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: My question is about Europe, this 9.1% growth in Europe this quarter that is a very strong number stronger than it had been pre-pandemic. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on in Europe, are you starting to see the pay-off of the long-term effort there to invigorate that business after the Visa Europe trend transaction. I mean, are you seeing just really elevated cash displacement. What are some of the underlying dynamics in Europe? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Lisa, I'd got say a few things. First of all, this movement of funds into these higher yielding savings accounts, definitely it was a real factor and that's not going to repeat itself, but not beyond that I think that you are seeing - be seen the beginnings of traction of a number of FinTech deals, I mentioned Revolut in my remarks, but Lydia and France comes to mind in and out, the FinTech in Turkey comes to mind that are really starting to scale up in terms of their relationship with Visa. I also think that we've had a pretty good track record of deepening some of our existing businesses and that we renewed as well, I commented on a few of those but if we go back over the past numbers of earnings calls commented on others. And I have made the point that, I think that I believe over the last five or six quarters that Europe has made a lot of progress in terms of relationship build they just going to take time to show up in the numbers, because they're either doing a start-up or you're doing a shift-in with the client and both of those just simply take time and they take time to ramp to get credentials out and then they take time to those credentials to ramp in terms of volume. The other thing, I would say is that open banking continues to be a strength for us in Europe, and we're having good success selling our value-added services, particularly, I commented in, Dan's or somebody else's question earlier, some of our products from CardinalCommerce as well as our 3D Secure products. So I think the beginnings of some of the success that we think we've been having over the last five or six quarters, plus this kind of one-time deal where people move money via their debit cards into these high yield savings accounts, and we'll see what happens, Lisa. Today, you probably saw our both France and Germany announced going into some form of partial lock-downs, again. So that's obviously not very positive news B2B driving volume across the continent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: I just wanted to follow backup again around the notion of cross-border volume is going to ex inter-Europe is probably going to drag on for a bit. And so what I'm trying to understand, are going to reconcile a little bit here is the specific opportunities that you might be pursuing, maybe more behind the scenes in order to offset some loss revenue and lost profits. So rather than kind of a very large drop list of products and opportunities. I'm thinking of things like increased authorization rates now that you have a lot more e-commerce cross-border that's happening and that's opening up the funnel for merchants. Are you able to offset some of those lost profit dollars as a result of those types of things? And then how prominently is CyberSource playing in that regard. Thanks\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I mean, we are clearly focused on all that, increasing authorization rates in particular corridors big priority, increasing activation of cards that can be used for cross-border critical priority. The growth of non-travel cross-border business big priority, cross-border business for new use cases that Al highlighted through Visa Direct like remittances, cross-border business with B2B Connect, all those are revenue streams that are new and very exciting and growing well, it's a big year in '21 to lay the groundwork for YellowPepper to scale. We have signed up a lot of clients. The volume is ramping, we're spending quite a bit of time and effort to ensure that the YellowPepper platform can scale and a lot of that will be cross-border flows not necessarily for consumer payments for but a whole range of other use cases. So there is a variety of non-specifically travel related cross-border use cases that are happening right now that we are very excited about and then we're doing as you said, the sort of the bread and butter stuff of improving authorization rates reducing fraud and all the things that would make people more willing to approve more cross-border transactions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Al, I was thinking about your answer to Lisa's question and I'm curious if you can shift into another gear and win more business in Europe with open banking and the digital shift there, I guess, how could you expand that to other regions as well. But I'm thinking about Europe, given the open banking dynamics?\nAl Kelly: I, certainly, hope so Tien-Tsin. We are very, very focused on it. I think we've talked about in the past. I mean, we really feel like we've been in the last year, 15 months really on our fund footing in Europe. We've got a really good win rate on FinTech's. We're having lots of really good discussions with banks about open banking in addition to the things I mentioned, we've got our Visa trusted listing, which allows customers to identify merchants that they trust, which will help users meet regulatory requirement and have a much better user experience for the customer. We've got the Visa delegated authentication which issuers' delegate authentication to merchant or digital wallets, which also reduces friction at the point of check out. So a lot of these discussions have gone very well and I think that people, who are clients, and potential clients are viewing us as being very supportive of what they have to do to deal with open banking downstream. So I believe that our momentum is good and you're going to continue to see it in our numbers.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Just a quick follow-up if you don't mind. And then some of the wins, you guys have had like Venmo and you talked about Revolut, pretty innovative including in the reward side of things like Venmo. I'm curious, if you'd also that you could see a little bit more of is this become available thinking about travel cards and some of the more traditional travel rewards might have less utility here during the pandemic, are you seeing that. Is that an area of focus perhaps?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think, issuers around the world are dialing back on their spending and their acquisition on travel related card at this point in looking at all alternatives. And even here in the United States obviously, I think you've seen a lot more activity on things like cash back than you are on travel co-brand. So I think in the near term that's going to be the case. I think though as travel returns, which I happen to be optimistic that it well, beside basically describe how I see it, which is that travel is for all intensive purposes, it shut for consumers. It's not that you are even having a choice of to travel or not to travel in most cases. It's so much of a hassle that right now that you just don't. It is not a good experience. And I think as travel can reopen. I think that people wanting to see the world and see family and friends and knock places off their bucket lists et cetera, it will start to come back and at that time, I think people will go back to promoting the travel elements of their card or the benefits of the card, as well as you'll see more attention paid back on the travel-related co-brand cards.\nVasant Prabhu: A couple of focus on it, let's say, bright spots from some of the early indication there is, as you know, the bulk of the cross-border business we have that's card present and the bulk of our cross-border travel is based on personal travel and that's an important one to note and that clearly seems evidence of pent-up demand because anytime a corridor opens up we shared the example of Turkey, there is a maximum pickup, there are more Americans traveling to Turkey now than they did last year by a significant amount, because they realize that's one place they can go. We've seen that from other parts of the world that are open like travel in and out of Dubai. So we're seeing a lot of travel from Europe into the UAE for example. So what we're seeing is there is pent-up demand the corridors, which are very few right now that are open are getting a lot of it and as corridor start to open you will see different travel pattern when you pre-COVID but I just seem to be a lot of desire to travel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg for from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: I know back at the Analyst Day, which I agree with you, Vasant, it feels a very long time ago. It's been a lot of time on B2B and I wanted to see now that we're six plus months into the pandemic, I mean, is COVID catalyzing accelerated growth in B2B for Visa. And if so, are there some supporting data points you might be able to share on that front?\nAl Kelly: So I'll start, Jason and Vasant can add. I would say that commercial B2B volume in the carded space is running pretty close to where you see consumer credit. So it's definitely has been hit and as the line - its growth has been, as I said fairly close to the credit line that said we've continued to invest heavily and trying to promote virtual cards is more digital spending is going to take place in the B2B arena and we're continuing to build out and invest in building out the B2B Connect network were up and have the capability up and going in 80 countries, we're looking to expand for the next 30 countries over the next year plus. And so we haven't really taken our investment dollars on building for the future, down much at all in this area, but there's no question, the volume has been impacted by lots of people curtailing their spending and lots of employees around the world working from home.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I mean just a little more color on the B2B side and the - as Al said in the card-based part of the business, we're seeing the small business side recover nicely. The large and medium-size side is the one that is still somewhat sluggish. We don't have a big travel related component in our card-based B2B business. On B2B Connect, we continue to build a nodes, lot of interest and we have some big new clients that will be ramping and hopefully, we can tell you more about that in the next few quarters. And then in the very large AR/AP business, there continues to be interest. We are very focused on trying to figure out the use cases that have traction and how we create value, but I wouldn't say that there is any dramatic shift, it remains the category of people are trying to figure out a way to create value there. So we'll again tell you more as things develop.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: We've seen obviously this uplift in the CMP transactions both online and even offline similar with contactless and I think we've been saying and I think you guys have said also there is - your technology can handle more of that market share than other local or PIN networks, given your investments. I guess first of all, can you just make sure - just verify that's true in your opinion. And then second of all, what kind of economic uplift is there from things like the CyberSource and fraud solutions you provide there. And then, Vasant, just a quick follow-up on the incentives comment you made about '21. You mentioned incentives I think 26% or so in fiscal '21, is that assume that cross-border does not - doesn't improve it all in fiscal '21? Are just stays basically October levels to get to that number. Thanks guys.\nVasant Prabhu: I mean what happens. I'll take the second part first. What happens to cross-border is anybody's guess, right. So we gave you a range of 25.5% to 26.5%. We have seen, let's say, a 6 point improvement from Q3 to Q4, from Q4, 41% down to where it's running in October is a 4 point improvement. So we've assumed some modest improvements through the year. So it's not saying that there is no improvement implied in there is some modest improvement. I think that's probably the best way to think about it, but it is a range, it's hard to estimate, we've giving you the best range. We will tell you more as the year goes by. And then your first question, and I'll now let Al take that.\nAl Kelly: So, I wasn't - in case of card-not-present, it's very, very good volume for us. As we - I think at Investor Day, we said that $0.15 in every dollar in the world. Today is, in face-to-face, it's spent on Visa Card in the card-not-present world. It's $0.43 on the dollar, simply because cash comes out of the picture. And obviously, as fraud has migrated more to online, as chip on card has depressed fraud in the face-to- face world that gives us an opportunity to work with issuers on driving down fraud by using various services and products that we can - we could provide and somebody alluded to it earlier, I mean it is still in the card-not-present world, still real opportunity to drive up authorization rates. I think it was, it was a question out relative to cross-border. And clearly, cross-border authorization rates and card-not-present are lower than authorization rates, domestically on card-not-present. But in both cases versus face-to-face, there is real opportunity to increase authorization levels to drive more volume. Darrin, you said something about contactless too, obviously that's in the face-to-face world and we continue to make, and we'll continue to make real progress there. I think COVID will help accelerate the pace in the United States which is the one market that has been much further behind, I think I said in my remarks that contactless transactions represents 43% of face-to-face and across the globe, 65% excluding the United States which gives you the magnitude of how far behind the U.S. is. I do think though that and maybe you meant Click-to-Pay, I do think Click-to-Pay will help as well, accelerate card-not-present as well, particularly for people who are - not card on file, but they are just logging on to buy for the first time and they're doing, they are being a guest. So I think that there is real opportunity for Click-to-Pay to help build a better user experience there. So we certainly remain really bullish and what can happen in the card-not-present world.\nMike Milotich: I would like to thank you for joining us today.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Milotich, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's third -- fiscal third quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted to the IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and the reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Mike, thank you very much. The past few months certainly continue to be challenging and our focus has and will always remain on the well being of our employees, clients and the communities, in which we operate. Even with significant impacts to the economies around the world, many aspects of Visa's business have proven to be resilient and have continued -- and we've continued to invest to propel Visa's growth well into the future in consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Today after discussing our results, I will then provide an overview of the ways COVID-19 is shifting the way consumers, businesses and governments want to pay and be paid and in turn how Visa is helping them. I will close with some notable deal highlights for the quarter that demonstrate how we continue to enable the movement of money globally. So to start our third quarter results. Net revenues in the fiscal third quarter were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 17% or 16% in constant dollars. All of the business drivers were significantly impacted by the pandemic. Payments volume this quarter declined 10% globally or 9% excluding China. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, which drives our international transaction revenue declined 47% on a constant dollar basis, driven primarily by the lack of travel. Including intra-Europe volume was down 37%. We processed 30.7 billion transactions or over 337 million per day through the quarter on our network, a 13% decrease over the prior year. However, in each case, the business drivers improved each month throughout the quarter meaningfully for payments volume and processed transactions and only marginally for cross-border volume. In new flows, Visa Direct grew global transactions in the mid-60s year-over-year. And our value-added services revenue grew in the mid-teens year-over-year. We also effectively managed our expenses, which declined 5% but more importantly this was achieved without affecting investments in our primary growth initiatives. Our non-GAAP EPS declined 23%. While, COVID-19 certainly impacted our fiscal third quarter performance there are many trends that are accelerating the demand for consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, which will help our business as we look ahead. In consumer payments, even with all the success Visa has had electronifying payments, there is still $18 trillion transacted in cash and check globally. In today's environment, people are sensitive to touching surfaces, including cash and check and we are seeing this manifest in interest and usage in tap to pay, which we know helps digitize cash at the low ticket level and has historically increased transactions by an average of 20% over time in mature markets globally. From second quarter to third quarter, we had nearly 50 countries improve tap to pay penetration by more than five percentage points and over 10 countries increased by 10 percentage points or more. We have helped more than 55 countries to increase the tap to pay limits, reducing the share of transactions that require consumer contact by more than 40% in several of those countries. In the United States, we added more than 80 million contactless cards in the first six months of calendar year 2020 as a number of our financial institution partners accelerated their issuance schedules. Tap to pay is likely to accelerate post-COVID, especially as consumers start going back to the office where they tend to conduct smaller transactions for their commute, paying for public transit fares and buying food and drinks. Another positive trend has been the shift to e-commerce. This works in our favor because Visa's share of digital commerce where cash is not an option is approximately three times greater than the physical point of sale. In the United States, Visa credentials active in e-commerce excluding travel were over 12% higher in June than in January. In addition to the total spend per active credential also increased during that time by over 6%, which is notable considering new adopters typically spend less than those used to shopping online. In fact when you isolate the active credentials who tend to be more significantly engaged in e-commerce, the spend per active credential increased by over 25%. And these trends are not unique to the United States. During this period in the U.K., active e-commerce credentials increased 16% while spend per active credential increased 3%. In Brazil, active e-commerce credentials increased 11% while spend per active credential increased 12%. In markets where e-commerce is not as developed there are examples of dramatic changes in adoption. Argentina experienced active e-commerce card growth of over 100%, and Romania 70%. In new flows, we continued our focus on addressing the $185 trillion opportunity. In B2B, the opportunity is across card-based, accounts payable and receivable and cross-border payments. While B2B volume is down during this work from home and very limited travel period, we are continuing to build out our capabilities and relationships to fuel future growth. A couple of quick points from the quarter. We recently established a global partnership with U.K. fintech Conferma Pay which enables companies to provision virtual Visa commercial cards to employees' digital wallets enabling tap to pay and simplifying expense reimbursement. For our large-ticket cross-border B2B solution called Visa B2B Connect, we continue to build the network out. Many banks are in the implementation phase. And when they are all live by the end of the year, Visa will be processing cross-border transactions in half of the 80 markets where Visa's B2B Connect capability is available. Let's look at the remainder of new flows. In the United States, P2P is up almost 80%. And in Latin America, we saw progress with P2P apps in Peru where there was nearly a 400% increase in transactions in Q3 versus Q2. Visa is also excited to announce a global partnership with PayPal including its Venmo, Braintree, Zoom, iZettle and Hyperwallet brands. This is an extension of a long-standing regional partnership with PayPal. This new global agreement will allow PayPal and all of its brands to offer fast Visa Direct-enabled domestic and cross-border payments and expand PayPal's real-time transfer capabilities globally. In the gig economy food and grocery delivery category, we have seen a nearly 50% growth in transactions from pre-COVID levels and have continued to add new program launches such as Instacart for shopper earnings payouts in Canada. G2C government-to-consumer use cases are gaining momentum employing both Visa Direct and prepaid cards. This quarter let me highlight some of the card examples. In the U.S., the Treasury distributed nearly four million economic impact payments via Visa prepaid cards. We also worked with CaixaBank in Spain on three projects issuing 330,000 prepaid Visa cards with government-allocated funds to support vulnerable families across the region. In France, Natixis partnered with Visa to issue 15,000 cards as a thank you to frontline hospital workers financed by the government. In value-added services, we've seen more clients turn to us for help. As e-commerce has expanded and new sellers are looking to offer omnicommerce payment capabilities that are safe and secure our CyberSource and fraud and risk capabilities have seen growth. Let me name two recent examples. A recent win in Saudi Arabia with Al Rajhi Bank, the largest acquiring bank in the country will leverage CyberSource to enable e-commerce payments platform for all Saudi Arabian government services through a centralized interface with the country's Ministry of Finance. Buying online picking up in-store has become very popular among consumers and is a key way for sellers to operate in this environment. However, this use case does bring a higher potential for fraud. One home improvement partner chose Decision Manager a CyberSource fraud offering to quickly review online orders for fraud risk and meet customer expectations for a two-hour pickup. This resulted in a massive increase in Decision Manager transactions in May alone at this merchant. Across all CyberSource risk products in Q3 we saw a nearly 50% year-over-year growth in transactions. Interest also has grown in our authentication products. CardinalCommerce which provides network-agnostic products for sellers and issuers to leverage the 3D Secure standard has seen accelerated growth in transactions this quarter versus last year. 3D Secure is making steady progress in Europe as well where the ecosystem is ramping up in advance of the secure customer authentication mandate beginning in December for most of Europe. We continue to work with the ecosystem participants as the deadline approaches given that some are not ready for the deadline. EMV 3D Secure transactions in Q3 has grown over 100% compared to Q2. Data and consulting continue to be valuable to our clients as they navigate this environment. Clients utilized our consulting services at an accelerated rate with almost 60% more projects completed than the third quarter of last year. Visa plays a critical role in providing data and analysis to help clients manage their business through the pandemic. And the client activity on our Visa Analytics Platform increased 60% just from Q2 alone. Now let me talk to new deals where we made very good progress this quarter. First our momentum in Europe continues. We renewed with one of the largest banks in the Nordics, Nordea to grow debit portfolios across the region. We expanded our partnership with Permanent TSB, a large issuer in Ireland with over 800,000 cards in force making Visa the primary card in most wallets in Ireland. We recently extended our partnership with UBS in Switzerland to debit. And we're winning processing. In Spain, we secured a significant deal to expand our processing capabilities for domestic transactions. Banco Caminos will migrate their issuing and acquiring volumes from their local processor to Visa. Europe was certainly not the exception in developing and renewing partnerships this quarter. In Singapore, we renewed our partnership with the second-largest debit issuer OCBC Bank to remain the preferred debit card issued to OCBC Bank's personal savings and current account customers. In Korea, we recently secured a renewal with South Korea's biggest issuer Shinhan Card. We renewed our credit and debit partnership with Banco de Bogota, our largest issuer client in Colombia. We recently won started issuance with Kaspi Bank, one of the largest retail banks in Kazakhstan. The bank is moving 100% to Visa over the next few years. And our leadership position in co-brand also continued. This quarter Visa renewed and expanded its strategic partnership with Best Buy including extending the My Best Buy co-brand relationship. Ford and Visa will collaborate on Ford's new FordPass Rewards Visa Card available to their 4 million FordPass rewards members and other Ford customers. Another recent co-brand win was with Verizon to launch a Visa credit card that provide savings on Verizon's industry-leading products and services along with benefits for everyday and essential purposes. And we signed a co-brand deal with Tiki, one of the leading e-commerce platforms in Vietnam. A key component to building issuance and acceptance is with fintechs. And this quarter we secured many wallet and neobank wins globally. Let me name a few. Careem, the biggest ride-hailing app in the Middle East and Africa will offer driver payouts with Visa Direct as well as credentials to their over 35 million user base. Hong Kong's digital transit card Octopus will accept Visa wallet top-ups allowing commuters to pay for transport and to pay in 35,000 retail outlets. In Saudi Arabia, we signed a strategic partnership with Hala [ph] a rising challenger bank that has the potential to penetrate an unbanked population of up to 7 million people. Neobank Vivid Money announced its official launch in Germany offering Visa debit cards in an all-in-one mobile application including innovative savings and cash-back solutions. In the U.S., U.S.-based Chime with over 8 million accounts launched access to a new Visa secured credit card, which allows consumers to build credit while spending on everyday purchases like groceries and monthly subscriptions. As I've often said, partnerships are fundamental to Visa's business model and these renewals and new deals will certainly help drive growth into the future. Before I close, I would be remiss if not to comment on the race situation in this country and around the world. For four centuries Black and African-American women and men have experienced many forms of social injustice and discrimination. It is offensive. It is frustrating and it's unacceptable. It must stop. At Visa, we are committed to do our part. Visa recently announced the next steps in our journey to drive inclusion and diversity across our company. We've announced a number of actions including the establishment of a Visa scholars and jobs program. And very importantly, last week, we announced that we are committing to increasing the number of underrepresented U.S. vice presidents and above by 50% in the next three years and increasing the number of underrepresented U.S. colleagues within Visa overall by 50% in the next five years. So to close, while there is some uncertainty in the near term for sure, we remain confident about our long-term strategy and growth prospects and our ability to make a positive difference in the world. On one hand, net revenue, EPS overall payments volume, cross-border volume and process transactions declined this quarter. Yet we saw growth in debit and in e-commerce volumes in Visa Direct transactions, growth in tap to pay and click-to-pay enablement and value-added services revenue. Furthermore, we've demonstrated our discipline. We've been able to reduce expenses by 5% this quarter while still investing in future growth. And we returned capital to our shareholders at historic levels and retained our dividend. All of this speaks to the resiliency of our business model. We have the scale, a trusted brand, digital products financial levers and most importantly, a talented team to emerge from this pandemic even stronger. We remain confident in the efficacy of our global network of network strategy, as we enable the movement of money for everyone everywhere. Now for more detail, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al and good afternoon, everyone. As we did last quarter, we will provide a fair amount of color on the business trends we are seeing as we navigate through this unprecedented time. I'll begin with the key business drivers then review our financial results and close with some perspectives on the next quarter. Starting with U.S. payments volume. For the quarter U.S. payments volume declined 7%, a sharp decline from mid-April was followed by a V-shaped domestic spending recovery. Volumes declined 18% in April, before returning to positive territory in June. July volumes through the 21st are up 7%. This recovery was jump-started by the economic impact payments and enhanced unemployment benefits, helped along by pent-up demand fulfillment and accelerated by the relaxation of shelter in place requirements. Debit outperformed credit by almost 30 points. Debit spending was up 8% while credit spending declined 21% in the quarter. Credit spending recovered 21 points from a decline of 30% in April to a decline of 9% in July through the 21st. Debit spending bounced 30 points from down 5% in April to up 25% in July. The outperformance of debit versus credit is driven by several factors. Some of them are more likely to persist than others. First, the government's economic impact payments were directly deposited into consumers checking accounts benefiting debit. Second, in times of economic uncertainty, consumers have a propensity to shift spending from money they borrow to money they have in the bank. Third, as you know, there has been a significant shift to online purchases in almost every day almost every \u2013 in most everyday spend categories which favors debit. Fourth, affluent customers tend to use credit for discretionary spending in categories such as travel, entertainment and restaurants, which have been especially hard-hit by the pandemic. Fifth, the last tranche of economic impact payments as well as unemployment benefits in over 20 states were distributed via Visa prepaid cards, which lifted debit growth by several points in May and June. Finally, in the U.S. Visa Direct was up over 75% this quarter, due to strong growth in a variety of use cases ranging from P2P, to insurance payouts, to payroll. The significant growth in debit demonstrates the acceleration of the secular shift away from cash to digital forms of payment as a result of the pandemic. The COVID crisis has also significantly accelerated the secular shift to e-commerce. Card not present spend excluding travel has grown over 25% every week since mid-April, which is 2x the pre-COVID growth rate. Card present spending improved steadily through the quarter as reopenings went into effect from declining almost 50% in early April to declining in the high single-digits by late June, but there has been little improvement since. It is too early to tell what all the underlying causes of this recent stabilization are. Recovery trajectories for card present volumes are relatively similar across states. In terms of U.S. spend by category excluding Visa Direct, performance can be summarized in three groups based on COVID impact and the recovery we've seen to-date. Each group represents roughly a third of our U.S. payments volume. The first group includes categories, such as food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. These categories have consistently grown at or above their pre-COVID growth rates in the high teens or even higher every week since mid-April. The second group includes categories that experienced spend declines between 10% to 50% in April and had all recovered to growth by the end of June. These segments include automotive, retail services, department and apparel stores, health care, education, government and business supplies. The third group includes categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic: travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants. These categories declined over 50% in April and are still declining year-over-year, although, each improved by between 20 to 45 points during the quarter. Travel remains the most impacted category still down over 50%. Fuel gallons purchased are growing again, but spend is down more than 15% in July driven by lower prices. Within the restaurant category, card present spend is still declining, while card not present spend continues to grow significantly with quick-service restaurants outperforming. Moving on to trends in the rest of the world. International payments volume declined over 12% in constant dollars in the third quarter. Similar to the U.S., debit significantly outperformed credit with debit down only 3% and credit down 20%. Card present spend improved through the quarter, as countries reopened, while card not present excluding travel spend remained elevated. Performance across categories was broadly similar to the U.S. Our best performing region continues to be CEMEA, which declined 5% in constant dollars. Within CEMEA, Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia had positive growth in the quarter fueled by a rapid recovery after April declines as well as client wins. Europe payments volume declined 10% in constant dollars in the third quarter. Central and Southeastern Europe which include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary recovered rapidly to post positive growth in the quarter. The U.K. returned to growth in June, driven by consistently strong card not present growth. Italy is almost back to prior year levels in June following one of the strictest lockdowns within Europe. Canada declined 15% and Latin America declined 13% in constant dollars. Brazil spend decline early in the quarter was one of the shallowest, but the recovery has also been slow. Brazil is now back near 2019 levels of domestic spending fueled by strong card not present growth. Asia Pacific payments volume declined 16% in constant dollars. Reopening of the Asian economies has been gradual with multiple phases depending on the country. Two of the least impacted countries were Korea and New Zealand, both of which were close to flat in the quarter. Domestic spending in Japan and Australia was back to 2019 levels by late June. India remains one of the most impacted markets globally. Processed transactions declined 13% in the quarter. Although this lags volume growth due to a mix shift, the trajectory of the processed transactions recovery is similar improving from a 24% decline in April to a 4% decline in June. Growth in July through the 21st is flat. Domestically, the mix of spend has shifted from low ticket to higher ticket categories. Cross-border transactions on the other hand are holding up better than volumes due to the mix shift from high ticket travel-related spending to lower ticket non-travel e-commerce. Cross-border -- constant dollar cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe declined 47% in the third quarter. Volumes declined 51% in April and improved marginally in May to decline 45%, but there has been little -- since. For the month of June and in July through the 21st, the rate of decline has stayed at 44%. Constant dollar cross-border volume including volume within Europe declined 37% in the quarter. It's important to remind you that cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe drives our international fees. As you know, the cross-border spend decline is driven by travel. Travel-related spend, which includes both card present and card not present in travel categories represented roughly two-third of our pre-COVID cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe. Travel-related spend declined 78% in the quarter and was still declining over 70% at the end of June. To have a recovery in cross-border travel, you have to have a reopening of borders. At this point, borders remain largely closed. The World Tourism Organization reported at the end of June that out of 217 countries, 189 or 87% had completely or partially closed their borders to foreign visitors. Of the remaining 28 countries, 10 had completely or partially suspended flights. Several other countries like the U.K. require quarantines and the rest had imposed visa restrictions or demand medical certificates. As we speak, cross-border travel, especially by air is even not possible or very difficult. While no one corridor derives a large portion of our volumes -- drives a large portion of our volumes, some of our most important corridors remain closed. Borders have to reopen before we can get a sense of what the cross-border recovery trajectory might be. In the few corridors, where cross-border travel is now possible, we have seen some significant recoveries. For example Americans are traveling again to Mexico and the Caribbean. Since the April low, these corridors have seen cross-border card-present volumes recover by 30 to 40 points. Travel to and from Switzerland to France and Germany is almost back to normal. Russian travel to neighboring countries has picked up. Travel from Europe to the UAE is gaining momentum. It is important to note that the vast majority of cross-border travel spend is on personal cards and not for business travel. Consumer travel demand for visits to friends relatives and for vacations is more likely to remain intact post-COVID perhaps even enhanced. The consumer travel recovery is likely to start with people going to countries within their geographic zone of comfort. This is already evident as we look at short-haul cross-border travel which we define as less than 3,000 miles. Short-haul air travel is recovering faster than longer haul corridors. Similarly drive to hotels are doing better as are leisure hotels versus business hotels. Growth in cross-border e-commerce spend excluding travel has been consistently in the high teens to low 20s since mid-April. The strong growth is fueled by retail spending which is growing about 30% since mid-April and drives the majority of non-travel e-commerce spend. In most countries, we see that once a consumer decides to buy something online rather than go to a local store, there is a higher likelihood the purchase becomes cross-border with little regard to where the item is shipped from. The strength in retail is offset by declines in entertainment, education, and government some of which are tied to travel and represent a meaningful portion of card-not-present non-travel spend. Much of the color I just provided excludes volume within Europe. Within the EU, borders have largely reopened. Intra-Europe cross-border card-present spend is up 40 points from the trough in April through three weeks in July, another indication of the possible trajectory of the cross-border recovery when borders do reopen. A quick review of our third quarter financial results. Net revenues declined 17% in the quarter or 16% in constant dollars. Third quarter service revenues were flat with prior year and reflect last quarter's volumes. Data processing revenues declined 5% supported by strong value-added services growth as well as acquisition-related revenue. International transaction revenues decreased 44% in line with the decline in cross-border volumes excluding volume within Europe. Other revenues declined 8% over the prior year due to value-added services impacted by the pandemic. The value-added services impacted by the pandemic include lower use of travel-related card benefits, lower marketing-related services for clients as many slowed marketing activities, and fees we waived on certain services which surged at the outset of the pandemic. We should note that had we reported service fees without a lag our service fees would have declined 11% and reported net revenues would have dropped an additional 4.5 points to approximately 21.5%. These lower service fees will impact our reported revenues next quarter. Before I move on, let me provide some more detail on where value-added services revenues are captured in the P&L. In the third quarter, total value-added services revenue grew in the mid-teens including acquisitions. Approximately two-thirds of our value-added services revenues are included in data processing as many of them are transaction-based revenue streams. These value-added services grew in the mid-teens driven by the strength in U.S. debit and prepaid issuer processing, CyberSource, as well as authentication and fraud services as Al highlighted. The remaining value-added services revenue is split roughly evenly between service fees and other revenue. Value-added services and service fees also grew in the mid-teens. Value-added services recorded in other revenues grew in the mid-single -igits due to acquisitions, increased use of our data products, and consulting, offset by declines in the usage of card benefits and marketing services I described earlier. Client incentives declined 2% versus last year and were 23.8% of gross revenue. As we've indicated before, the vast majority of incentives are tied to payments volumes. However, incentives declined less than gross revenue pushing up incentives as a percent of gross revenue. Let me explain why. First, incentives are generally tied to total payments volumes and only selectively to cross-border volumes. As declines in cross-border volumes have been deeper than total payments volumes and cross-border volumes have higher yields, incentive declines lag gross revenue declines. Second, heavy renewal activity like we had in fiscal year 2019, causes incentives to grow faster than gross revenue. As a result, the decline in incentives lags gross revenue on the way down. Offsetting these factors to some degree is the service fee lag. As I mentioned earlier, service fee lag mitigated the gross revenue decline reported this quarter. This will impact us negatively next quarter. Third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses declined 5% as we were able to execute additional cost management initiatives, particularly in the areas of marketing and G&A. These expense reductions were achieved while sustaining investments in our longer-term growth initiatives. Acting early and decisively has helped us to reduce expenses fast. Non-GAAP non-operating expense was $118 million for the fiscal third quarter. Interest income was lower due to the sharp drop in interest rates. Interest expense was higher from our $4 billion debt issue. The non-GAAP tax rate was 19%.  Finally, some perspectives on the fourth quarter. Forecasting revenues remains a challenge in this environment. It is difficult to predict when borders will reopen and what the trajectory of the cross-border travel recovery will be post re-openings. Domestic volumes have bounced back nicely in most countries and inevitably the rate of recovery will slow. Other uncertainties include the impact of the recent spike in infections and the economic impact of stimulus payments tapering off or ending altogether around the world.  A few points to note as you model revenue growth for the next quarter. As I indicated earlier had we reported service revenues without a lag, third quarter net revenue would have declined an additional 4.5 points. This will cause fourth quarter reported net revenue growth to be lower than the third quarter absent the change in trend on key business drivers.  Continued recovery in domestic payments volumes and transactions will improve the data processing revenue trend, but not reported service revenues. This will be partially offset by higher incentives related to the increasing volumes. As such the most important variable that would improve the fourth quarter net revenue growth rate is cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe.  One other point to note driven by these turbulent times: if the cross-border recovery remains sluggish through the fourth quarter, the revenue mix shift away from cross-border will persist. Adding in the impact of the service fee lag, incentives as a percent of gross revenues are likely to increase by two to three points over the third quarter levels. This percentage should normalize as cross-border volumes improve and the domestic volume recovery stabilizes.  Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter are expected to decline roughly in line with the reductions we delivered in the third quarter. Non-GAAP non-operating expenses are expected to be around $140 million. Even with a significant COVID-19 impact, we expect to generate a very healthy level of free cash flow this year. We ended the quarter with over $17 billion of cash equivalents and investment securities on hand. With access to the commercial paper market on favorable terms and our $5 billion revolver our liquidity position remains strong.  In the third quarter, we bought back 5.2 million shares for almost $900 million at an average price of $180.47. Year-to-date, we bought back 36 million shares for $6.5 billion at an average price of approximately $180. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. Crises create both risks and opportunities. We have moved fast to mitigate risks by ensuring strong liquidity, reducing expenses while sustaining key growth investments and closely monitoring network performance, security, daily settlement, fraud and other key metrics. The crisis accelerated many favorable secular trends: the digitization of cash, the shift to e-commerce and the penetration of tap to pay.  Visa Direct momentum has remained very strong and value-added services have continued to grow in the mid-teens. Our focus remains on helping all our stakeholders, cardholders, clients, governments, regulators and of course, our own associates as they navigate through these unusual times.  With that I'll turn this back to Mike. \nAl Kelly: Mike, I think you're on mute. Mike, you're on mute. \nVasant Prabhu: Al maybe we should turn to questions. Operator, why don't we move to questions? \nAl Kelly: So Vasant, I also understand that we had a technical issue that some people might not have heard the end of mine and the beginning of yours. \nVasant Prabhu: Okay. \nAl Kelly: I'm looking for a little -- I was hoping Mike would give us a little direction whether we should summarize those points. Maybe... \nVasant Prabhu: Mike is suggesting we keep going. \nAl Kelly: Okay. So maybe what I would suggest is that let me just quickly summarize what I said at the end and maybe you could talk a little bit about U.S. debit before we open it up to questions. \nVasant Prabhu: Okay. \nAl Kelly: So what I said is that certainly the future is going to have uncertainty associated with it, but we continue to believe in our strategy and our growth prospects. Certainly, there were things that declined in the quarter: net revenue, EPS, overall payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. But we did see growth in a number of important areas: growth in debit, growth in e-commerce volumes, growth in Visa Direct transactions, growth in tap to pay, advances in click-to-pay enablement and growth in value-added services revenue.  We also demonstrated our ability to reduce our expenses while continuing to invest in the future and we returned capital to shareholders at historic levels and retained our dividend. So net-net, we believe that our business model is resilient and we have a lot of confidence in the efficacy of our global network of network strategy.  I think it would be helpful, if you'd Vasant could just comment on U.S. debit because I think a lot of people might not have heard it from what I understand. \nVasant Prabhu: Okay, Al. Yes. So I talked about why debit was outperforming credit. As you may have heard debit has bounced back about 30 points and is now growing at about 25% in the first three weeks of July whereas credit recovered by less than that and is still declining 9% through the first three weeks of July, whereas credit recovered by less than that and is still declining 9% through the first three weeks of July. I went through six reasons for that. I'll do those quickly. Economic impact payments going directly into checking accounts helps debit. In times of economic uncertainty, consumers do shift spending away from money they have borrowed, to money they have in the bank. Third reason, the shift to online has caused a lot of everyday spend categories to move to e-commerce, which has favored debit, because normally debit is used for everyday purchases. Affluent customers reason number four, tend to use credit for discretionary purposes like travel, entertainment and restaurants, which have been especially hard-hit in times like these. The economic impact payments this is reason number five, were distributed using Visa prepaid cards in 20 states, including the unemployment benefits which lifted our debit growth in May and June. And then finally, Visa Direct, which helps our debit numbers was up over 75% this quarter as a whole bunch of use cases performed really well. So I think, we'll probably stop there Al and take questions. I think we might have lost Mike, so we can take questions.\nMike Milotich: Jordanne, are you there?\nOperator: Yes, I'm here Mike.\nMike Milotich: Jordanne, if we can go into Q&A that would be great.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nLisa Ellis: All right. Good afternoon, guys. Hopefully you can hear me I guess.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes we can.\nLisa Ellis: So I'm going to hit a topic you did not cover on the call. Al, question for you about big tech. The big tech companies are now facing elevated regulatory pressure obviously very present right now in the U.S. also in Europe related to some of their competitive practices. Can you comment on, how this regulatory scrutiny you see affecting one those firms' initiatives in payments? Like in particular, are there anything \u2013 any practices that they're doing that you at Visa or Visa would view should be scrutinized? And then also, do you view this sort of regulatory scrutiny on big tech as a plus for the payments ecosystem and for Visa or as potentially a negative? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Well, Lisa as you might imagine, we have relationships with all of the companies that you would consider big techs. Some are a bit more extensive than others, but we certainly have relationships with all of them. I certainly can't comment and wouldn't comment on regulatory scrutiny that they are experiencing. But if it involves payments, and we can be helpful to them, or helpful to the government in either advocating or explaining what's going on we will jump into that. There was a case with a payment initiative that we had going with Facebook in Brazil in the last month, where we did just that as an example. I think that, these big techs are \u2013 certainly, have attracted lots and lots of users and have developed relationships with them. And some of those relationships are going to require money movement or payments capability. And we certainly want to be there, and be the partner to work with them on those particular things. And we'll leave it to them to figure out and deal with any of the regulatory issues that they're facing. And we're a phone call away, if we can be helpful. But I think in most cases, it's kind of up to them to resolve them. Jordanne, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Neill from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Neill: Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could provide some anecdotal views on what I think is probably the next leg of the sort of secular catalyst here the sort of silver lining of this pandemic, if there is one which is obviously the e-com growth has been robust. But how are the bank partners and merchant partners sort of thinking about the move back into brick-and-mortar commerce in what will inevitably be a significantly greater demand for contactless payments? And then, if I could just have a quick unrelated follow-up. I was just wondering, if there's any update on the Plaid acquisition and any comments around the lawsuit there? Thank you very much.\nAl Kelly: Well, interestingly enough as you probably could see in some of our charts as card-not-present has \u2013 I'm sorry as card-not-present has started to work its way back it lagged obviously card-not-present it was impacted much more greatly by the pandemic. Card-not-present volumes have held up, so we're not seeing any declines there. And I think that what all issuers and anybody who's rooting for economies around the world to come back would love to see a situation where both card-not-present and card-present both bounce back and that bricks-and-mortar commerce on main streets and communities around the world continue to grow. I think the case for contactless Matt has been made. We have seen consumers and governments and merchants voting through their actions and contactless has had \u2013 or tap to pay had tremendous momentum kind of going into COVID. And if anything COVID had accelerated the momentum of tap to pay even in the United States, which we know has been further behind, but as I cited we've added 80,000 \u2013 or I'm sorry, our issuers have added 80 million credentials that are tap to pay-enabled in the first six months of the year. Something like 80% of the merchant volume is \u2013 that is occurring in the face-to-face world is occurring at terminals that are enabled for tap to pay. So I think it's going to just continue to grow everywhere around the world. And I believe that the COVID situation will help accelerate the growth here in the United States at a perhaps faster pace than it might have happened otherwise. As for Plaid \u2013 \nVasant Prabhu: Al, I might add a couple of things. One crisis fosters innovation as you know. And if anything this has made more and more merchants focus on omni-channel commerce which CyberSource is very much in the middle of. And increasingly merchants are getting better and better at serving customers, seamlessly across bricks-and-mortar as well as e-commerce. It has also made a lot of categories that never used e-commerce become a lot better at e-commerce. And that's \u2013 you've seen that in a lot of everyday spend categories. You've seen that with restaurants. And more broadly across retail people have come up with more innovative ways like curbside delivery has been perfected in many ways. And that we think is going to be here with us, which is really a way where you order online but you may pick up physically. So you have one more delivery option, you can get it delivered after a day or two delay or you can get it right away by going and picking it up. So there's a lot going on. And I think the most important point that Al made was that even as we've seen card-present improve from minus 50 to minus high single-digits, card-not-present has stayed very robust continuing to grow at those mid-20s levels for quite a while now. So lots of changes underway.\nAl Kelly: Matt, let me address your Plaid question. It's still pending regulatory approval. And we certainly are expecting to close by the end of the calendar year and are doing everything we can to comply with any request from the regulators that are looking at it. We are as excited about the Plaid acquisition today, as we were back in January, when we made the announcement. And we really believe we got the asset we wanted. And all of the various benefits that we have articulated in prior calls we believe are still there. Everything from the depth of their integration with fintechs, the fact that they are most attracted to a lot of fintechs that they're positioned in terms of how far along they are we believe they have the best team. And we see it as the best way to integrate into Visa. So we're \u2013 we remain very excited about Plaid and hopeful to close by the end of the year.\nMike Milotich: Next question please, Jordanne\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller: All right. Hey, guys. Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. First on the fourth quarter, fiscal fourth quarter comments. Just to clarify I think you guys are saying that the \u2013 just the lag effect of services versus prior quarter volume would impact that line by four points. But I guess we're just wondering if the \u2013 just given the trends we're seeing on transactions processed flattening out, shouldn't those trends be enough to offset that when it comes to growth in fiscal Q4? And then Al just bigger picture, when we think about the services, all these other value-added services you guys are doing well with I mean, do you see these sticking around post-COVID in terms of the demand you're seeing for analytics and potentially the card-not-present service fees or CyberSource? \nAl Kelly: So why don't I let Vasant answer the first piece and I'll come back and address the second piece? \nVasant Prabhu: Sure. So if you look at the various lines on the revenue line, service fees as you indicated and as we told you in the comments are known already. They're going to report service fees based on our volumes in the third quarter. And the volumes in the third quarter was hopefully the low point. And as we said had we not done a lag, our service fees would have been down 11% and total net revenue would have been down as you said in that 4, 4.5 range. So that is going to happen. That's a known fact. And even if volumes improve on the domestic front and transactions improve, the service fee number isn't going to change next quarter. So that's locked in. So when volumes do improve which we expect will be the case on domestic volumes and transactions, transactions revenues will definitely go up. Value-added services revenues will definitely go up. But the other thing that goes up is the contra-revenue line incentives. Incentives will go up to reflect the higher volumes because we don't book incentives with a lag. Incentives will go up but the benefit of that revenue from the higher incentives we won't get on the services line \u2013 service fee line, we will get it on \u2013 we will definitely get it on the processing line. So there's something of an offset there. I just want you to be aware of that. But the biggest variable is going to be cross-border. If there's a change in trend in cross-border and it improves then that would be the single biggest reason to expect Q4 trends to be better than Q3, recognizing that you've got pressure going in the other direction from the service fee lag. So there's some complexity created by these things because of the turbulent times we're in. We've tried to help you with it. And hopefully, we can help you some more if you like answer more questions later on.\nAl Kelly: And Darrin on your second question, I'm very bullish on what's going to happen with value-added services in a post-COVID world. First of all two-thirds of our value-added service is a platform-type services, CyberSource issuer processing risk and fraud. The need for those is going to continue. And if anything the volumes and transactions that will run through those will go up. Where we've seen some declines are in travel-related card benefits which is going to get better as travel comes back. We've also waived some fees because of the pandemic. And once we're past the pandemic, we won't waive those fees as readily, so that volume will go up. Travel-related benefits will go up, as I said, as travel comes back. So I see value-added services being very well positioned coming out of COVID and feel very good about the contribution they'll make and how they'll continue to diversify our revenue profile over time. \nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I think the other things to add there, three of our largest value-added services we think are going to sustain their growth which has already accelerated. Our issuer processing business, which is directed towards debit. Debit has become the engine for cash conversion right now. Debit growth rates as you saw are 25% in the first three weeks of July. So as long as debit growth rates are at an accelerated level, the issuer processing business will clearly have high growth rates. CyberSource always benefits from the shift to e-commerce. And now with their focus on omnicommerce, CyberSource clearly is benefiting from the shift. And then finally our risk and fraud services, certainly benefit as things move more to e-commerce which is where fraud is an area that we can really help a lot on. So they're reasons to believe that higher growth rates can sustain post-COVID. \nMike Milotich: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.\nJames Friedman: Hi, thank you. Al in your prepared remarks you shared some P2P growth characteristics. You were going kind of quick there. I -- that disclosure was new at least to me. But I was wondering if you could repeat what you said and also at the same time share some use cases about how you're seeing the P2P applications develop?\nAl Kelly: Well what I said in my remarks was that P2P is up almost 80% in third quarter and in Latin America -- that was in the United States I'm sorry up 80% in the third quarter. And in Latin America there we saw progress with two different apps -- P2P apps in Peru where we saw a nearly 400% increase in transactions in Q3 over the prior quarter Q2. We've got this tremendous track record of working with P2P providers. And as we said in the past, we were heavily skewed toward the United States and Russia. But we're -- and where we have relationships with most of the big P2P providers; Square Cash, Venmo, Zelle etcetera, I think that now we're seeing our P2P capability through our Visa Direct platform becomes something that people are looking to us for as P2P applications are developing in other countries around the world. \nVasant Prabhu: Since we had some issues earlier we'll run longer. So we'll probably go for at least 10 minutes past the hour. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nCraig Maurer: I was hoping Vasant, you could comment on if we see cross-border -- the cross-border recovery continue to stagnate into next year and domestic volume continue to pick up intra-Europe cross-border continue to pick up where should we be thinking about incentives as a percentage of gross revenue going? What's the risk to next year in terms of upside from that percentage? And then perhaps, Al maybe a comment or two on the renewal of the Durbin Amendment version 2 or 3 whatever we're at this point and EPI in Europe? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. In times like these I think it's not easy to make long-term projections clearly. In terms of cross-border and its recovery yes it's possible I suppose that it remains sluggish. It all depends on borders reopening. Wherever borders have been opened or the restrictions have not been significant, we've seen some pretty quick recoveries. So to the extent that there are borders reopening, it may not be globally but there could be corridors opening up as we're already hearing Australia, New Zealand you've seen that it's mostly open across the EU. It's starting to open in other geographies within regions. So it's not black and white, I think in terms of the cross-border recovery. You could see some changes in travel patterns because of how countries open up. But if cross-border remains depressed certainly the mix won't help us. And that will cause the percentage of incentives to gross revenue to stay higher than what you might call -- what it would might have been normalized mix of earnings -- of revenues. The other factor that's influencing it is probably most acute in the fourth quarter which is the service fee lag. Normally our service fees from one quarter to another don't have such significant swings because our business tends to be quite stable, so that service fee lag effect will moderate. So I think the best way to describe it is, it will probably normalize from the levels you see in the fourth quarter. It will certainly normalize because of service fee stabilizing. It will probably normalize some because the cross-border business will recover in corridors, but we'll wait and see how fast cross-border normalizes. \nAl Kelly: Let me address your other two questions you asked about Durbin. Visa is fully compliant with all the requirements of the Durbin Amendment. And we don't have any rules or requirements or other restrictions that inhibit a merchant's ability to select their routing decisions make the routing decision of their choice. And merchants are free and often do route to various unaffiliated networks enabled on a debit card. So that would -- I think we're in good shape as it relates to Durbin. EPI, we have a history of dealing with either regions or groups of countries or countries developing their own scheme or intra-market network. It's something that we're very, very used to dealing with. We do know though that developing a network is not an inexpensive thing to do and it's not a onetime investment. You have to continue to push and invest and innovate and be creative to stay ahead as it relates to all the elements of security, fraud prevention, risk, authentication etcetera. And so we will continue to monitor and engage constructively with regulators and banks in Europe on EPI. But on the other hand, we're going to continue to invest heavily behind our various networks to make them as good as they could possibly be. And we will be continuing to focus on making sure that our clients know the benefits that they can obtain by doing business with us and running on our networks. \nMike Milotich: Next question please, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey thanks. I just want to ask on the spread in U.S. debit and credit I know you went through it a couple of times Vasant. But it's wider than what we saw in 2008, 2009. So is there a way to try and quantify how much of the debit outperformance we can attribute to secular versus stimulus benefits? And curious, also, I just want to make sure any impact on yield differences between the two products. I don't think so, but just wanted to make sure.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. There are some modest yield differences depending on parts of the world and so on. I don't think you should view that as a huge factor. In terms of the reasons that might stick as we go ahead, I think we went through five reasons. One, the economic impact payments and unemployment benefits being distributed on Visa prepaid cards, clearly, that's linked to the crisis and probably is not something that will continue. Affluent customers putting off some discretionary items like travel entertainment and restaurants, which has hit credit in particular, that probably normalizes over time, so that you can attribute to COVID. The propensity for people to spend money -- spend the money they have versus money from -- borrowed money that is something you do see in times of uncertainty. And then, some of the economic incentive impact payments going into checking accounts, clearly, has helped debit. But there's a few others that are clearly sticking. The fact that Visa Direct is still going very strong, that has been helping debit for a long time and we'll continue to do that. The fact that debit has become the mechanism for cash conversion to digital in everyday spend categories and in just about -- in most categories, which have seen a big increase in e-commerce has benefited debit, I think some of that sticks. So I think the best way to describe it is that, the acceleration of cash conversion has disproportionately helped debit and that is most likely going to stick.\nAl Kelly: And Tien-Tsin, it's Al. I would only add that I think the -- if I look back, same observation you do about the 2008, 2009 time frame. But e-commerce is just much, much bigger and it just appears that people who are doing card-not-present e-com non-travel are using their debit cards much more than their credit cards.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you parse out some of the drivers of the 36% decline in international transaction revenue yield? I imagine a lot of that's just the big drop in cross-border travel. But if you could help us think through the drivers in terms of how much might be inter-European versus debit? And how should we think about international transaction revenue yield going forward?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. So I think it's very important to continue to point people to the decline of cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe volumes. The decline was roughly -- was 47% in cross-border constant dollar volumes excluding intra-Europe. So the revenue decline is, roughly as you can see, in line with that. The reason being that -- and if you look at total cross-border volume that includes intra-Europe. Intra-Europe looks more like a domestic transaction. In fact in our international revenue line, the contribution from intra-Europe transactions is very small. The international revenue line is driven almost entirely by volume excluding intra-Europe. Now there's a few other things there that can have an impact. Exchange rate shifts can. Changes in currency volatility can. So that explains -- and then, some small changes in mix in terms of which corridors are doing better than others, because of some yield differences across corridors. But that explains the 44% decline in revenues versus the 47% decline in volumes ex intra-Europe. But as you can see watching that volume line ex intra-Europe is the best indicator and that's what you should focus on.\nDavid Togut: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, could you just comment on the 10% growth in processing transaction yield year-over-year and thoughts going forward?\nVasant Prabhu: Right. There's two factors driving it. One is that, cross-border transactions have held up a little better than cross-border volume. So the mix has helped a bit, because cross-border transactions for processing have a higher yield. And the second is we have value-added services and some acquisitions in that line. And as you heard, value-added services are growing in the mid-teens in that line. So those two things have helped data processing yields go up.\nDavid Togut: Much appreciated.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Koning: Yeah. Hey, thanks guys. And I guess following up on that last question, you said that the ex-intra-Europe volume down 47% but 44% revenue decline. Is that gap going to change much? I know FX volatility probably helped a little bit in Q3 to make revenue a little better than the volume decline. But are there any other kind of yield factors in there other than FX volatility to think about?\nVasant Prabhu: The variables that can make a difference there, first of all the 44% to 47% is a relatively small delta. There'll always be some differences between the two. They won't match each other precisely. But you're right, currency volatility is one factor. Another factor would be mix. Certain corridors can have better yields than others. So if the recovery of cross-border favors higher-yielding corridors, you can have something of a difference. But other than that, it should track pretty closely to volumes, ex intra-Europe volumes.\nDave Koning: Okay. Well, thank you.\nMike Milotich: And Jordan, we\u2019ll take one last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Al, can you expand upon your recent conversations with regulators and governments? Now on one hand some merchants are lobbying for lower fees in this crisis and I understand that's not a new phenomenon. But then there are very real benefits of digital payments, especially in this current environment. So just \u2013 can you just talk about how your conversations with regulators and governments are evolving in this crisis? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Look, I think like many people governments are finding themselves in uncharted territory here. And they're all well intentioned trying to figure out the right things to do. Our biggest piece of advice to governments as it relates to core payments is to do no harm at the moment. I mean, right now I think the less amount of moving parts, as we're fighting through this pandemic is the best answer for everybody. This is not a time for any kind of changes. Governments are also increasingly talking to us in terms of looking for information that we have in terms of trends, because they're trying to understand what's happening in their economies. And in many ways, we could get them real-time picture of what's going on faster than they can get it themselves. And the last thing, I would say is that, there's a lot of interest in the form of governments to become more role models in terms of what they want to see in their countries from a digital adoption point of view. And so as they are \u2013 have genned up stimulus programs, unemployment programs, thank-you programs, and all kinds of other things, they're looking to Visa to help advise them on how they could distribute funds digitally as opposed to cutting checks. So, I think my view at the moment is that governments have \u2013 are being very, very thoughtful and reasonable in terms of what they're saying, and they're also being good listeners. And so, we're going to continue to do our job to provide them with whatever information they need and to provide them with whatever advice and counsel we can provide to be helpful to them both in their role as governments, and setters of laws as well as in their role as potential clients for various Visa services. Before we close out, one of the things I gather that did not \u2013 when we had a little blackout with \u2013 in terms of the transmission was I did before I closed make a comment about the race situation in the country and around the world. And I'd like to just cite that again. For four centuries, Black and African-American women and men have experienced incredible forms of social injustice and discrimination. And it's offensive, it's frustrating and it's unacceptable and it has to stop. At Visa we've committed to do our part. We recently announced the next steps in our journey to drive inclusion and diversity across our company. We announced a number of actions, including the establishment of a Visa scholars and jobs program. But very importantly, last week we announced that we're committing to increase the number of underrepresented U.S. vice presidents and above by 50% in the next three years and increase the number of underrepresented U.S. colleagues within Visa overall by 50% in the next five years. We want to do our part to eradicate the social injustice in the world. It's way past time that that has to be the case. With that, thank you to everybody. Mike, did you want to \u2013 \nMike Milotich: Yes. Thank you, Al. So yes, once again, I apologize for the technical challenges. We will make sure that the replay that's on our website as well as the transcript reflect everything. And if you have additional questions of course feel free and reach out to us here on the Investor Relations team and we're happy to help you. So, thanks so much and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "V", "quarter": 2, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-04-30 21:36:07", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Visa's Fiscal Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Milotich, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Jordan. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Visa's fiscal second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted to the IR Web site. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's Web site and the Investor Relations section of our Web site. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and the reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And one last note before we get started. Given the amount of content we have today we want to allow time for Q&A, and so we're likely to run over by a few minutes. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Hey, Mike, thank you very much. And good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us today. First and foremost, I hope you and your families are well and safe. A year that looked quite promising after a solid first quarter has been substantially disrupted by COVID-19. While the business has been negatively impacted, in March and April, our focus has been doing the right things for our employees, our clients, and our communities around the world whose lives have been affected in unimaginable ways. We continue to manage our business for the long-term although we are pragmatic in understanding short-term circumstances. Through that end we are certainly being quite careful about our spending on our expense base, and we are pulling back on discretionary spending especially related to personnel, travel, professional services, and marketing. Throughout all of this we remain committed to investing in the future, in product development, in technology, our brand, and business development. You may recall that at our Investor Day we laid out a compelling case for Visa's growth as we look to be a single point of connection for money movement globally. And there are three primary levers to that growth, consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. I want to be absolutely clear that nothing has changed about these opportunities in terms of the medium and long-term growth for the company. On our call today, I'm going to cover our results, our response to COVID-19, and some updates on the underlying business and long-term prospects for growth. To start, our second quarter results. Net revenues in fiscal second quarter were $5.9 billion, an increase of 7% or 8% in constant dollars. Although cross-border volumes were already weakening in February, driven by Asia, for the most part the business drivers were not meaningfully impacted by COVID-19 until the latter part of March. A quick snapshot on our quarterly results are as follows. Payments volume grew globally 5% or 7% excluding China, with over 500 million transactions on Visa per day for each of the 91 days in the second quarter. Cross-border volume declined 2% on a constant dollar basis, and we processed 34.9 billion transactions on our network, an increase of 7% over the prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS growth was 9%, helped by prudent expense management. We recognize, given the environment, that the investment community would appreciate as much information on our performance as possible. And to that end, Vasant will dive into more detail than usual when I am finished my remarks. Since the COVID-19 outbreak we've been in very close and regular contact with employees, clients, partners, and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times. Our foremost priority is the health and wellbeing of our employees and their families. To that end, I pledge to our 20,000 employees that there would be no layoffs in calendar year 2020 related to COVID-19. We recognize the critical role Visa plays in maintaining the stability, security, and resiliency of the global payments ecosystem. And let me state that our network infrastructure and application performance has been unaffected even as we transition the vast majority of our employees to a work-from-home status. Our business operations have comprehensive and coordinated plans in place to address business continuity and recovery needs around the world. We're working closely with our clients in a number of initiatives, starting with tap to pay which has gained even more momentum in the United States with issuers and merchants as they seek to reduce the need for cardholders to make physical contact at the terminal. Navy Federal recently started issuing tap to pay cards. So now nine of top 10 U.S. issuers are participating, and we have surpassed 175 million tap to pay cards in the United States that have been issued, that is more than any other country on the globe. On the merchant side, a large grocery chain recently rolled out tap to pay to more than a thousand stores, so now nine of the top 10 grocery stores are enabled for tap to pay. At the end of the second quarter almost 60% of face-to-face transactions, excluding the United States, were tap to pay. And tap to pay transactions grew over 40% year-over-year. We've also launched a Web site where merchants can request free tap to pay signage for their terminals. And large merchants like KFC and Pizza Hut have ordered them for all their stores in the United States. Globally, we actively engaged with merchants, acquirers, issuers, and governments to increase tap to pay limits. In fact, over 50 markets in the last few weeks have announced increases. To name a few, 26 European countries, including the U.K., Poland, and Ireland, 25 countries in the Middle East and Africa, including the Ukraine, Georgia, and Egypt. Also Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have increased their limits. And we expect other countries to follow recognizing the benefits of digital payments. Visa is also working closely with governments around the world to respond to the crisis in a number of ways. For example, in the Dominican Republic we developed a virtual prepaid solution to rapidly expand the government's emergency disbursement program, from 800,000 to 1.5 million beneficiaries. Likewise, we will be deploying Visa Direct solution to support Guatemala's emergency relief program to reach two million households over the next three months. In the United States, Visa supports over two dozen state government programs, including unemployment insurance programs. And given the environment, we are seeing a 400% growth in accountholders just in the last. Data is another area where Visa has been able to assist governments during the crisis. We're providing helpful insights into economic performance to nearly 20 government agencies around the world. Visa is also helping our communities. We recently announced the commitment by the Visa Foundation of $210 million to support two programs. $10 million towards charitable organization on the frontlines responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as public health and food relief in each of the five geographic regions in which Visa operates, and $200 million to support small and micro businesses around the world with a focus on fostering women's economic advancement. Let me now shift to updates on the underlying business, which will be really very good for us in the medium to long-term prospects for growth. Even with COVID-19, commerce and innovation continued, and our core business had a number of positive developments with several key relationships renewed and new partnerships formed. This is all in support of the opportunities for meaningful growth that we see in consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Let me just highlight a few of them. In the United States, these are one two notable deals from issuers who recently completed mergers and previously had contracts with both Visa and the competitive network. We are very pleased to announce the extension and meaningful expansion of our consumer credit, consumer debit, small business, and commercial issuing, as well as our DPS debit processing partnerships with Truist, the sixth largest U.S. issuing bank. We look forward to working with this bank on a myriad of Truist brand building, innovation, and consumer experience efforts in the years ahead. Additionally, following the merger of TCF Bank and Chemical Bank to create the 27th largest banks in the United States, these are one of the existing business and new debit business. In Europe, we continue to make progress. In the U.K., we extended our long standing partnership with Barclays, which processes nearly half of the UK's debit and credit transactions, enabling us to jointly focus on innovation and support Barclays' growth into new markets. Also in the U.K., Visa signed an extended agreement with Cooperative Bank, building on our 30-year relationship to support their 3.4 million retail and small business customers. In France, Visa renewed a 10-year agreement with Group BPCE, our largest client in Continental Europe with more than 40 million customers. Visa and one of the largest German Banks Comdirect Bank announced an agreement to issue consumer debit cards and grow their consumer credit business, and ING-DiBa extended its relationship with Visa for both debit and credit. A Pan-European commercial bank selected Visa to grow their consumer credit and corporate card business across six European markets: Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the rest of the world, we renewed and expanded partnerships with some of our largest clients. We renewed deals with two large debit issuers, Al Rajhi Bank, the largest retail bank in Saudi Arabia, and Chunghwa Post, the Post Office in Taiwan. In Australia, we signed a 10-year exclusive issuing partnership renewal with the Bank of Queensland, one of Australia's leading regional banks to serve their close to 1 million personal and business customers. In Latin America and the Caribbean, we extended partnerships with the largest issuers we have in Panama, Peru, Jamaica and Costa Rica. In Brazil, we were chosen as the preferred brand by Caixa, the largest banking customers and debit card issuance; and XP, a leading investment platform that is moving to issue digital credentials and cards. We also obtained our license to operate as a clearinghouse for card payments in Mexico, which will allow Visa to provide domestic network processing services. This is a key step for Visa to bring innovative solutions as well as World Class security and reliability to a very important market. As you know, Visa is the global co-brand leader and this quarter was no exception in terms of sizable wins. We announced the co-brand partnership with core hotels as the fourth largest global hotel chain with 39 brands such as Fairmont and Sofitel. This represents the most significant de novo co-brand opportunity in the travel sector in recent history. Our partnership will expand the Accor Live Limitless Loyalty program to its 64 million loyal member base and more than 250 million customers globally. In February, United Airlines Chase and Visa announced an extension of our long-term credit card partnership into 2029. Visa is proud we've extended our partnership with United and Chase. We're excited to bring the strength of our brand and network to continue building on the program's success to deliver even more value and cardholder engagement. As Visa seeks to grow our consumer business, wallets remain very important for both new issuance and acceptance and we've made noteworthy progress this quarter. Previously mentioned partnership agreements with Paytm in India and Toss in South Korea are now issuing credentials. In addition, we add new wins with STC Pay in Saudi Arabia, AGA in Nigeria, PayCo in Korea, and Kias in Japan. In China, we signed a five-year partnership with Tencent, the parent of the WeChat platform with more than 1 billion monthly active users. This collaboration with Visa marks Tencent's first co-brand card with an international card scheme. And we look forward to partnering on innovative cross-border solutions for Chinese credential holders. In Sub-Saharan Africa, we've announced a strategic partnership with Safaricom, the largest telecommunications firm in Kenya, and the provider of financial services through M-PAiSA. With 24 million M-PAiSA users and 173,000 M-PAiSA merchants, wallet partnerships like these are paramount to expanding our issuance and acceptance globally. Collectively with WeChat and Safaricom, we now have relationships with wallet providers that give us the potential to embed Visa credentials in two billion wallets. Shifting to new flows with $185 trillion of opportunity, we're focused on moving money end-to-end for businesses, governments and consumers. In Europe, we're working with Lydia the number one Fintech in France for the younger, younger people that are below 30 in age and a P2P service with over three million users and growing at over 4,000 users per day. In the United States, we recently renewed our important relationship with Square for their cash app program, including Visa Direct capabilities and the cash card issuing platform. Visa Direct continues to be a powerful capability, especially in the COVID-19 environment. As one specific example, Visa Direct transactions for workers speaking earned wage access or on demand pay across supermarkets, quick serve restaurants, healthcare, and hospitality categories increased well over 100% year-over-year this quarter. We're also working on digitizing cross-border P2PAY. This quarter Remitly launched cross-border in seven countries. MoneyGram expanded to 11 additional countries and KB Kookmin card one of the leading issuers in South Korea also initiated a cross-border program, all with Visa Direct. Cross-border also plays a sizable role in the B2B space. And we entered into an agreement for B2B virtual cards with ICBC, the largest bank in China, representing our first B2B partnership with a bank in China. Visa and Australian cross-border Fintech Airwallex announced the new Global Partnership with the launch of a borderless B2B cross-border card, and we continue to look for new ways to drive new flows with unique capabilities and solutions. Value-added services are an extension of our core business and represent a significant opportunity for us to deepen relationships, help clients and grow our business. This quarter was no exception in terms of clients looking for assistance. In DPS, in addition to Truist, we renewed six issuer deals that represent nearly 20% of DPS's annual transaction volume. In terms of disputes, our recently acquired Disputes platform Verified signed an agreement with a large e-commerce provider to enable the delivery of key transaction details from their CRM systems to issuers in near real time which helps prevent disputes and reduces charge-backs. In terms of data, as you can imagine, our clients are very interested in benchmarking their performance throughout the quarter, leveraging our Visa Analytics platform. Nearly 5,000 client users were enabled at the end of the quarter, accessing 33% more reports than the first quarter for a total of 90,000 reports access. In consulting, clients are consulting and analytics at an increased rate. We delivered approximately 50% more projects than in the second quarter of last year. The CyberSource business continues to gain momentum globally and supportive acquirers and merchants around the world with innovative Omnicommerce, gateway, and fraud management services. For example in India, CyberSource is now the market leading payments gateway, in part due to the introduction of our safe quick technology for e-commerce merchants, which allows card holders to enroll and store card information for quick and secure checkout. Merchants also saw a 15% increase in authorization rates when using Safe Click. These are just some examples of how during challenging times our clients look to us. So, in closing, you can see that there's a lot of business momentum. Yes, there is no doubt that our performance will continue to be impacted by COVID-19. We continue to focus our attention on supporting the shift to e-commerce, the acceleration of PathToPay and do digital payments, as well as providing our clients with critical value added services. Although the road ahead will certainly have its challenges for a number of quarters, our business model is resilient, and our strategy to enable the movement of money globally is more relevant than ever. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. This is an unprecedented time. And we know you all have many questions about the COVID-19 impact on our business. To provide you with up-to-date data in this fast-moving crisis, we will discuss trends occurring after the quarter ended more than we normally would. Also, while the absolute level of growth or decline is important, the second derivative of the rate of change in trend lines is equally important. To help you with all this, we've added a slide to our earnings presentation with weekly data for March and for April through the 28th. This slide provides additional details on U.S. payments volume growth, as well as process transaction and cross-border volume growth. Starting with U.S. payments volume, after strong growth in January and February, payments volumes dropped precipitously in the second-half of March, as lockdowns went into effect across the U.S. By the last week of March, payments volumes were declining 28%. Credit spending was harder hit than debit and declines have been more than 25% every week in April. On the other hand, debit was down in the mid-teen through the first two weeks of April and spiked into positive territory in both week three and week four as the first wave of economic impact payments were distributed. It is too early to tell if this uptrend in the second-half of April is the start of a recovery, a new plateau, or will fade in a couple of weeks. Through April 28, U.S. payments volumes are down 19%, debit is down 6%, and credit is down 31%. As may be expected, there is a drastic difference in thought present and card not present performance with card not present or ecommerce volume excluding travel up 18% in April and card present volume down 45%. There are also significant differences in how lockdowns have been impacting spend categories. One-fifth of U.S. payments volume is full in drugstores along with Walmart, Costco and target. This is the only category still growing up approximately 20% in April, and essentially all this growth is coming from online spending up over 100% in the last two weeks of April, assisted by the adoption of curbside pickup and delivery. Another one-fifth of U.S. TV is in categories that are less discretionary, like telecom, utilities, insurance, and business supplies and equipment. These are holding up relatively well, shrinking less than 15% at the end of March, and have recovered to flat with a prior in April. A third of our U.S. payments volume is in categories that are declining between 15% to 50%, such as retail, automotive, healthcare, education and government. There are significant variations in performance within these categories with more essential purchases showing more resiliency. For example, home improvements within retail, or hospital and medical equipment within healthcare, categories where spending can be delayed or is more discretionary or more heavily impacted. For example, a federal spending within retail or dentist and doctor visits within healthcare. About one-fourth of our payments volume is in the hardest hit categories, including travel, fuel, restaurants and entertainment, all declining over 50% in April. The travel decline affects all sub sectors and is the deepest at around 80%. Fuel declines were driven both by falling prices and fewer gallons purchased, which typically offset one another to some degree, but not right now. Within restaurants, quick service restaurants are holding up better, in part due to being better equipped for this environment, but apps drive-thru and delivery infrastructures already in place. Within entertainment, amusement parks and movie theaters are especially hard hit, while gaming is a small component of the category is up over 200% Visa Direct activity has slowed a bit, but growth remains robust at around 70% in second quarter and in April. Use cases such as P2P and food delivery disbursements even accelerated while ride sharing and merchant settlement disbursements are negatively impacted. As economic impact payments have been distributed, we have seen significant increases in home improvement, automotive, health care and some retail goods and services categories. Travel fuel restaurant entertainment categories have not benefited. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 4% and over 7% excluding China in the second quarter. Growth remains strong CEMEA, and Latin America growing 19% and 14% respectively, in part due to climate both regions. Asia-Pacific, excluding China grew 3%, decelerating four percentage points from the last quarter, as the COVID-19 impact was significant starting in early February for a large part of the region. Europe grew 6%, down two percentage points versus last quarter, with the largest deceleration in central and southern Europe. Looking across some key international markets that we process the majority of transactions, major markets in Europe as well as Canada have trends similar to the U.S. both in terms of the trajectory and the depth of the decline. Australia appears to have lockdown better with a shallower decline. Much like the U.S., leverage in all these markets is outperforming credit, and there has been a tick up in the second-half of April. Within Asia, there are variations. Hong Kong dropped in early February along with the rest of China and appears to be recovering in April. Singapore dipped early then stabilized and has dropped sharply again under most stringent restrictions. Japan is on a downward trend, as a lockdown goes into effect. India with a very rigorous and sudden lockdown has experienced one of the fastest and deepest declines. Elsewhere, Brazil is doing relatively better so far. Across markets, performance by category is generally similar to the U.S. Differences across countries seem to be driven by the quality of the e-commerce infrastructure in place, and consumer adoption of digital payments prior to the outbreak. With economic stimulus payments in the second-half of April, categories benefiting the most are some sectors of retail like home improvement, business supplies and equipment, healthcare, education and government. Travel fuel, restaurants and entertainment generally remain depressed. In two key markets, where we do not process transactions, Korea and China we have some limited data sets. This data indicates Korea may have been among the least impacted markets. In April, a recovery is well underway in both markets. Process transactions grew 7% for the quarter, with sharp declines in March and are down 25% to April 28, slightly better than levels reached in the last week of March. Transactions typically grow several points faster than volume, as we penetrate small ticket transactions in everyday spend categories. In the recent uptrend or stimulus payments, that relationship has temporarily changed, as consumers have prioritized higher ticket categories like home improvement, and automotive over low ticket categories like restaurants and entertainment. Constant dollar cross-border volume declined 2% in the second quarter, or 5% excluding volume within Europe. Volume growth was strong and steady in January and started to slowdown in Asia by the second week of February, as the crisis spread around the world, we saw significant week on week volume declines in March, exiting the month declining 44% or 51% excluding intra-EU volumes, and volume remains down 43% to April 28 or 52% excluding intra-EU. The majority of the cross-border spend decline is travel related, both card present and card not present. All card present and travel related non-card present spend represents roughly two-thirds of our cross-border volume, excluding volume within Europe. This spend declined over 40% in the month of March, and is down 80% in April in line with the last week of March. The trajectory and depth of cross-border travel related declines is quite uniform across corridors and regions. Growth and cross-border e-commerce spend excluding travel decelerated in March, but remain positive led by retail spending. In April, cross-border ecommerce spending is recovering across categories and markets and has grown faster than pre-crisis levels. A quick review of our second quarter financial results, net revenues grew 7% in the quarter, or 8% in constant dollars. As a reminder, our service revenue is driven by last quarter's payment volume. Based on current quarter volumes, total net revenue growth would have been around two points lower. Second quarter service revenues grew 9%. Data processing revenues rose 11% supported by value added services and acquisition related revenue. International transaction revenues grew 2% continuing to benefit from last year's pricing actions. Other revenues rose 20% over the prior, aided by value added services. Client incentives were 22.6% of gross revenues, up slightly from last quarter. As we told you previously, the expected client incentives to step up due to high renewal activity, which continued in the second quarter as noted. The majority of client incentives are tied to overall payments volume growth in the current quarter, but there are contracts with clauses specific to cross-border, as well as annual or multi-year targets that are adjusted with changes in performance. GAAP operating expenses were up 4% excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring acquisition related costs. Non-GAAP expense growth was 3%. This is significantly lower than our original plans for the quarter as we moved fast reduce expenses when we saw the widest spreading more on expenses in the few minutes. GAAP non-operating expense was $95 million for the fiscal second quarter, including $2 million of med equity investment losses. Our GAAP Q2 tax rate was 19.4%. Moving now to how COVID-19 might affect the rest of this fiscal year. This pandemic is global in scope, very significant its impact and early in its evolution There is a high degree of uncertainty about what happens over the next few months. As is self-evident, a prior outlook for fiscal 2020 is no longer relevant. And it is not possible to provide you with any reliable forecasts for the second-half. Our revenue trajectory over the near term will be driven by three critical variables: first, the depth of the decline, second, the time we stay at trough level, and third, the trajectory of the recovery. It is impossible to reliably forecast for the depth of the decline, timing, trough and trajectory of recovery are going to be over the near term, especially since these variables differ across categories and countries. It will depends on many factors, which we will be tracking including city, county, state, and country decisions on when and how they reopen the staging of the reopening by business type and category. How permanent the shift in consumer behavior is by category, consumer willingness to engage in activities, where social distancing may be harder to execute, like dine in restaurants, mass entertainment, hotel stays, and airline travel, and when borders reopen, consumer confidence and venturing beyond the geographic zone of comfort. In the final analysis, this is a health crisis. As such consumer behavior and the pace of normalization will be significantly influenced by the availability of testing, advancements in therapeutics, and ultimately a vaccine. We have no crystal ball that allows us to reliably forecast revenues in this environment. As it relates to our revenue there is one point to note, we report service revenue with a one quarter lag, so when we have a recovery it will take another quarter before it shows up in reported service revenues. In fiscal year 2020, our third quarter will be helped, and the fourth quarter hurt by this lag. Why revenue outcomes are hard to predict? We can give you more clarity on expense outcomes, since we have more control over them. In early February, as we saw the impact of COVID-19 in Asia, we move fast to rethink our expense plans. As a result, we were able to reduce a second quarter expenses from our previous expectation of mid-teens growth to the 4% we reported. In fact, if you exclude the acquisition, we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19, which were not in our expenses in the second quarter last year, expenses were up only 1%. We have plans in place to hold second-half expenses flat compared to last year, and excluding acquisitions, our expenses will be down in the low single digits year-over-year. We're evaluating additional actions to reduce expenses even further. As you all know, ours is a business where expenses are largely fixed. And we want to preserve to the extent possible critical investments that will drive long-term growth in new flows and value-added services. Also, as Al has indicated, we will not layoff employees related to this crisis in calendar 2020. Operating within these parameters we have reduced expenses in the second-half by scaling back hiring plan to only the most critical roles, redeploying existing resources to high priority areas, reducing and redeploying marketing spend, as is planned for the now delayed Tokyo Olympics, prioritizing projects to reduce professional fees, and the use of external resources. And of course, like most companies, we're saving on travel and meetings for the foreseeable future. While we expect operating expenses to be flat or down in the second-half, non-operating expenses will be higher. With the $4 billion in debt reissued, in April, interest expenses will be higher, while interest income has dropped sharply with the rate declines. We now expect non-operating expense to in the $250 million in the second-half excluding gains on losses, versus $148 million in the first-half. Moving on to cash flow, liquidity, dividends and buybacks, our free cash flow in the first-half of fiscal year '20 has been tracking ahead of expectations. However, given the anticipated revenue decline in the second-half, our free cash flow this fiscal year will be below what we had planned last October. Despite the COVID-19 impact, given the cash characteristics of our business, we still expect to generate a very healthy level of free cash flow this year under any scenario. We ended the quarter with $13 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities on hand. Since the end of the quarter, we have added to our cash balance with our $4 billion debt issuance. We issued debt in three tranches, seven, 10, and 20-year maturities, at a weighted average coupon rate of 2.16%. We have ample liquidity with cash on hand as well as access to the commercial paper market on favorable terms, and a $5 billion revolver which remains undrawn. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. In the second quarter, we bought back 17.8 million shares for $3.2 billion at an average price of $180.10. Year-to-date we have bought back 30.9 million shares for $5.6 billion at an average price of $179.94. Our plan to buyback over $9 billion in stock this fiscal year remains unchanged. Crises bring with them both risks and opportunities, and this one is no different. We've acted fast to mitigate the risks. We are actively working on identifying and capturing the opportunities. It is very likely that this crisis could accelerate trends that were already underway, like the shift to ecommerce and the shift to digital forms of payment. It is speeding up tap to pay adoption, driving growth of new flow use cases we highlighted at our Investor Day, increasing demand for our value-added services, and offering opportunities to add to our capabilities through selective acquisitions. While our short-term performance will suffer a setback, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of our business. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: Thank you. Jordan, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning and I hope you guys are all staying well and healthy. Just a question now on the structural nature of travel, could you just talk about how you feel about cross-border travel and the structural impacts that might occur as a result, and when you expect it to rebound? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Sanjay. Hope you are well as well. Look, right now I think -- I don't know what percentage, but some huge percentage of countries are hunkered down, and that's largely driven by government mandates. I do think that over time people will -- obviously these lockouts will loosen up. And I think the first thing to come back will be domestic travel as people look at stretch their legs and move around a bit. I think cross-border travel will take a little bit longer to come back. I think we need some advances. And as Vasant made note of in his remarks, I think we're going to need some advances in terms of testing and therapeutics, and ultimately a vaccine will start to make everybody feel a lot more comfortable. So I think it's going to take some time and it's going to take -- but I think it will come back. I think it's possible that there could be some business travel that doesn't return at the same level given the fact that we're in an environment where people have been working from home for seven, eight, nine, 10 weeks depending upon the market, and realize that they can get done what they need to get done. So we'll have to see how that ultimately plays out. Offsetting that, Sanjay, is the reality that I think the cash displacement opportunity in the business as well as the explosion of ecommerce are going to be real structural opportunities that didn't really exist at the same level before COVID-19.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. So following up actually on that last question and answer, could you talk a little bit, Al, about the -- that evolution, if you will, of ecommerce and cash conversion. And related perhaps to the elements of the economics to your business of those types of transactions? And probably should have said at the outset, glad you are all healthy. Thanks for the extra data, and hope you can keep that up too.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Moshe, appreciate it. Hope you and your family are well as well. First of all, there isn't a tremendous amount of difference in terms of the economics to Visa whether it's credit or debt, or card present or card not present. There just isn't that much of a difference. I think that's the main point. I think beyond that we're seeing people during these last couple of months start to buy things in the ecommerce environment that they would typically buy in store, whether that's furniture, electronics, in some cases apparel. And I think to the degree that they've had good experiences, that that's a really good thing. And remember, when you think about ecommerce the reality is that it's a very, very positive thing for us because cash isn't a competitor in that space. So the reality is that we get a lot higher share from those transactions that go to ecommerce than we get in the face-to-face world, and I think there are some permanent changes. Now, whether gaming stays up at the level of that as people are finding things to do while they're home, I suspect that'll come back down a bit, but I think, in general, ecommerce will explode coming out of this.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, a couple of points -- data points to add to that. I mean you might have noticed that ecommerce -- cross-border ecommerce excluding travel is now trending at a faster growth rate than it was prior to the crisis, and a lot of that is what you might call retail spending. More than half of it falls into categories that are people buying goods and services on a cross-border ecommerce format. The other thing that perhaps could be permanent changes are there are categories now, for example, food and drug, where the propensity was more towards face-to-face transactions, that have had massive shifts to, obviously at this point for reasons where they have no alternative, to online buying. And some of these goods could be fairly permanent. And then beyond that, even face-to-face, there's certainly a growing tendency to not want to use cash, and also of course not even do -- just to tap your card. The aversion to cash could be persistent, which means that even in face-to-face transactions the penetration of digital forms of payment could be growing in a permanent and structural way faster then it might have prior to the crisis.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks so much for all this data. Just on the client incentive side, forgive me if I missed it, but did you give us a little bit of an outlook there on how to second-half might look on client incentives with all the wins that as we have listed. I heard the majority is tied to volume growth, but any other detail would be great. And then just as a quick follow-up on Truist, can we assume the legacy non-Visa SunTrust cards will be flipped or would those be reissued at expiration, just wanted to clarify that. Thanks. \nAl Kelly: Tien-Tsin, thank you, and hope you're well. I'll take the second-half and let Vasant comment on client incentives. We're obviously thrilled with [technical difficulty] deal came out, and over time there's going to be some cards swept, but we're going to work very hard to Truist. Remember, they're building a new brand here. So the BB&T and SunTrust brands, they're looking to sunset those and get the Truist brand out there as soon as possible. So I think given that these cards are a ongoing manifestation of the brand that are shown every time they get pulled out of the wallet, I think they're going to want the move fairly quickly, but we're still working through the details as the deal just recently got done. Vasant, you want to comment on the client incentives?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, Al. So on client incentives, I think you asked two questions. Our expectations in terms of client incentives as a percent of gross revenue, we gave you a range at the beginning of the year. I believe it was 22.5% to 23.5%. That range has not changed. So we still expect to be in that range, even as we've had, as we told you, a very, very high level of renewal activity as well as wins and so on, that Al went through. As far as how our incentives might respond to what's happening right now, the incentives are always meant to be linked to performance, and especially volume performance. So our incentives are pretty much linked to volume performance and should move with volumes. And that'll play out over the next few quarters. So hopefully that answers your two questions.\nTien-Tsin Huang: No, it does. I appreciate it, guys. Stay healthy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nBob Napoli: Hi, thank you and good afternoon everybody. A follow-up I guess on just the growth of value-added services and what you're seeing in the growth rate of value-added services over the last several weeks. And then I guess in line with adding the value-added services, the acquisition of Plaid, is that still on track, and how is Plaid performing?\nAl Kelly: Hey, Bob, thank you, nice to hear your voice. First in terms of value-added services, these tend to be excellent revenue streams and quite resilient. And some of them are certainly transaction-dependant, and the volume could go down, but honestly in times like this the value goes up though to our clients. So those would include things like CyberSource or our risk products or debit issuing processing products. And then obviously we have value-added services that really are not really tied to volume, and they're also extraordinarily valuable in times like that. I referenced two of them in my remarks, both the criticality of data to our clients, because everybody is seeing the numbers go down and they want to make sure that they're not way out of whack with where everybody else is, and then obviously consulting services. It's also an exciting time for us to be able to introduce other new clients to some of our value-added services. So the crisis gives us an opportunity to have dialogue and make sure that our clients are using all the tools that they can from Visa. So we're going to continue to make sure that we stay in close contact with our clients throughout this, and where appropriate introduce them to value-added services' offerings that they may not be using. As it relates to Plaid, we're on track. As you know, we have to go through regulatory review, and we expect to have that done by the end of the year, and we remain as excited about Plaid as we did when we talked about it at Investor Day. In terms of how it's doing, we don't own them so I can't really comment on that at this time.\nBob Napoli: Thanks, Al. Thanks, Vasant, appreciate it.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good evening, and good to hear your voices. The government involvement in the digitization of payments has been something that you mange very carefully because it has its pluses and minuses. As you're going through this crisis how do you anticipate how the governments might act differently with respect to digital payments coming out of the crisis, meaning any new regulations you could foresee, new government-funded initiatives, positives or negatives for your business? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Well, I think, Lisa, first of all, you're right on that I think that governments are just as interested in digitization as any other business at this point, and it helps with transparency, it helps them understand whether funds are going with more accuracy than they might get, they might get otherwise. Certainly, I think it's also possible that governments could on the other hand look at pricing in the marketplace. I continue to believe that pricing should be set by markets and not by governments. I think markets do a far better job of doing it than governments do, and I would say that specifically as it relates to Interchange, there's a tremendous amount of value delivered by our bank partners in terms of the credit, they extend to enable buying to the services they provide to the servicing they provide, to the fraud they provide, to the risk services they provide and rewards that they provide. So there's a tremendous amount of benefits that the economies of countries see and the individual citizens in those countries see. So and I would also say that any actions that would disrupt any type of recovery during a pandemic like this would be foolish and potentially very damaging.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citibank. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Al. Hi, Vasant. Hope you're all healthy, and appreciate the incremental detail. I wanted to ask about this pricing in the current environment, but the ability to exercise price improvements to reflect value and other factors and the willingness to use it when merchants are not in great shape. So that and then the quick follow-up just on the clarification on one of the charts, when I look at U.S. payments volume growth versus process transactions growth in the operational performance metrics mid-April, they both look down 30%, but now one is down 10% and the other is down 20%. So there's a different pace of recovery. I was wondering if you could explain that.\nVasant Prabhu: I can take that question on transactions versus payments volumes. And Al, I'm sure will take the other one. I had it in my comments. So, I'd encourage you to go back and look at them, but just to repeat that, it is we think a temporary shift. Typically, as you know, transactions growth does better than volume growth because we are penetrating more deeply into smaller and smaller transactions. The reason it's different in the last two weeks of April, is what we have seen is that as some of these stimulus payments have come through, people are prioritizing pent-up demand in areas like automotive, like home improvement, and they're not spending it on lower ticket categories, like entertainment and restaurants. So what you're seeing is a mixed shift in how people are spending money to hire higher ticket items. As a result, PV has improved more than transaction labs. So that's what you're seeing, and that's probably not what the long-term trend is going to be, but it's what we're seeing right now.\nAl Kelly: Hey, Ashwin, just let me first add to Vasant's comments, think about a normal day, when people actually go to work and they're not working from home, you go and you get some coffee at a gas station or at a mass transportation shop, you pay for your transit, you pay for your breakfast, you pay for your lunch, all of those kinds of everyday low ticket transactions are not happening in this environment. So, in addition to what Vasant was saying, you could just, that's a huge driver of the change here and why we're seeing higher average ticket costs, but lower level of transactions. The other question you asked was about pricing. Look, we're in an unprecedented period, certainly not something I've witnessed in my life where the impact of this pandemic is truly global. Our focus right now is to make sure that we're bringing as much stability through the payments ecosystem as possible, which is why we get into our major co-release this month of April where we normally do, and I don't know that we've ever not done it before, but this is the times where it was called for, and I think we're going to certainly be very cognizant of the uniqueness of this time in terms of pricing. As like, I think most companies in most industries will be reevaluating their plans on all kinds of fronts, including the pricing lever and how much they pull it given this new reality.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Bye. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hi, thanks guys. I'm glad everybody's doing okay there. Look, I wanted to start off just if we, Al, if we had to sort of put all the pieces together a longer-term, and assume that some travel maybe wouldn't come back per se, we're not sure yet, but there are enough positive implications of what's happening around contactless incremental flows, more digital and maybe some of your services that you think can actually offset that. Is this, I mean, have you done the work to think about whether those can add up to maybe offset, but then just one quick follow-up would be on capital allocation. I guess I maybe I missed it, but I didn't hear anything about changing plans around buybacks or anything along those lines. Can you just give us some update on that? Thanks guys.\nAl Kelly: So, I'll tackle the first question, and let Vasant tackle the question on capital allocation and buybacks. So Darrin, I again, I think that there are -- and we're still talking about it there might be others, but I think the big, big opportunities here are e-commerce and cash displacement. Cash, $18 trillion spent on cash, and I think people are realizing that currency is a germ-carrying mechanism, and people don't want to be subject to it moving from one person to another person, it's actually catching the joins that way. So I do think cash displacement is going to really, really take off, and we've seen that in terms of the interest of governments to raise contactless limits, the interest of merchants to move to contactless, the interest of issuers, who are lagging behind to issue contactless enabled cards, and I hope we see it, as we start to talk to long tail sellers or merchants, who might have here to for resisted jumping into card acceptance, and they'll realize now that they really need to on a going forward basis if people shun cash. So, I think that's a big opportunity. Likewise, I think e-commerce is a big opportunity, and I think Ryan McInerney in his presentation, talked about the fact that somewhere around $0.15 or $0.16 on every dollar around the world is spent on visa cards and the face-to-face world, but when you move into the world of e-commerce, it's like $0.44 or $0.45 that's a big opportunity for us. And then as you said, and I mentioned earlier, I think there'll be some negative on travel, certainly in the short-term, and I think that people are going to be quite reticent to leave their country in the short-term until there is some advances because they don't want to be, they want to be stuck somewhere. They don't want to be for a prolonged period of time. So I think the degree that travel comes back is not clear, but I think this world is still a world of globe -- full of global citizens who ultimately are going to feel the urge and the desire to get back on airplanes and explore the vastness of the earth. We have not done the work, Darrin to say how these things offset one another. I think at this point we're more interested in studying the things that Vasant referred to in his remarks to get a better sense of kind of just the recovery before we get into how this might create some permanent change. Obviously, these are things we're talking about, but not things we've dimensioned as of yet, but I do think there is some exciting opportunities that will largely your offset or fully offset the changes in consumer behavior as it relates to grab. Let me ask Vasant to answer your question on capital allocation Darrin.\nVasant Prabhu: So, with the list of capital allocation, first in line of course, as we want to invest as much as we need to in our business because we still think the long-term growth opportunity remains extraordinary, and to that end, even as we scale back expenses, we have preserved the investment in critical growth areas like new payment flows, including Visa Direct, B2B in our value-added services. So that's part one. Part two is M&A. We remain very focused on adding to our capabilities where it makes sense through acquisitions, and there may be some opportunities here over the next months and years, and certainly Plaid is something we're looking forward to closing on as Al said, but M&A would be next in line. In terms of dividends, there has been no change in our dividend policy. In fact, last week, our board approved our regular quarterly dividend. So those of you who are owners of our shares will get that soon. And finally, in terms of buybacks, we have had no changes in plans. As I mentioned in my comments, we have bought back $3.2 billion in stock in the second fiscal quarter. So through the first-half, we bought back $5.6 billion. So we're a little ahead of our pace. Since we view this particular crisis as structurally one that does not diminish our business in the long run and most likely enhances it, and we don't see any long-term secular trend lines changing. We felt that in period, in the month of March, our stock was trading below our views of intrinsic value, and therefore we were buyers. So there has been no change in our buyback program. We do have plenty of liquidity. We're watching that very closely. As I told you, we had $13 billion in cash and cash like instruments on hand, and then we issued $4 billion in debt. So, as we speak, we're close to $17 billion in cash on hand. So we are very focused on ensuring adequate liquidity, and that is cash on hand not counting our revolver or even our access to commercial paper markets. So, hopefully that addresses all your questions.\nDarrin Peller: Yes, it's helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon, thank you for taking my question. So I have a follow-up on e-commerce, as you noted that e-commerce very good for you as cash is simply not an option. Can you expand upon other benefits Visa sees in e-commerce in terms of greater sought services, tokenization value added as we process more of those digital transactions. And then as a follow-up based on what you're seeing in the market is the uptick in e-com usage coming from people who are already very avid e-com users or is it new demographics GOs were also coming online, who were historically reluctant to buy. We're just trying to figure out if new payment habits and digital views are being acquired now?\nAl Kelly: Thanks for the question. So in terms of e-commerce, certainly it gives us an opportunity amongst other opportunities to sell our CyberSource capability as more and more businesses I think are going to seek to be omni channel and businesses that didn't realize that they paid the price. I believe Vasant talked about it in his remarks that one of the differences that we saw from country to country was that countries that did not have mature e-commerce capabilities or infrastructure, definitely have suffered more than company or countries that that do have it. I think that e-commerce relationships and tend to be sticky as you can get their card front of digital wallet or front of on file. Certainly, as we've talked about it a few times, the reality is that we can easily see that e-commerce brings new people into the fold that previously wouldn't have spent -- if not having the capability for being able to buy online. So, I hope it does. It accelerates improvements and the experience in e-commerce. I've talked a number of times about the fact that we still have work to do because the abandonment rate is not very -- is still too high, authorization rates can be too low, and there's a real opportunity to improve those and improve the experience and FRC is one of the reasons that we want to do that. We're also seeing that new users in e-commerce is up materially in segments like food and drug, and restaurant, and QSR, where e-commerce was never big before as people are looking to have alternatives to just the food that they get from the supermarket. So we're seeing that uptick as well.\nMike Milotich: Last question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our last question comes from Eric Wasserstrom from UBS. Your line is open.\nEric Wasserstrom: Great, thanks very much. Can you hear me all right?\nAl Kelly: Yes.\nEric Wasserstrom: Okay, great. So I know it's a little difficult in the context of the withdrawn revenue guidance, and as you've underscored, there's many conflicting dynamics there, but is there some way that you could help us frame how we should be thinking about maybe the puts and takes in operating margin? Obviously, you've done a lot to contain costs. It sounds like there's going to be some yield shifts on the revenue side, of course, you've got Plaid on the horizon. So, is there some way over time you could help just frame what operating margin might look like or within some bounded range or something?\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. I think you can sort of get to it yourself. So, we gave you a sense of what our second-half expense growth is going to be. We said it would be flat, including acquisitions, it will be down in the low single-digits excluding acquisitions, and we hope to do better than that. We're still working on some expense reduction programs. So, if you have a general idea, and remember our non-operating income will be higher, non-operating expense will be higher because of interest expenses going up and interest income going down. So, you sort of know those lines. So, it all depends on where revenue comes out. So, you can model revenue decline, you know where expenses are, and it will tell you what the -- you know the margins will then end up being. As we've always said, we think of this as margins are an outcome, not an objective, but they're a function of what your revenue growth is versus your expense growth. The expenses are declining in the low single-digits, but your revenues are declining more than that, as is likely in the third quarter, then it will have a margin impact. In terms of modeling revenues, I mean, we've given you the most up to date information as to what the trends are. So, as we look at it, it all depends on do you think where we are is the trough, when do you think we will start to recover from that trough, and then what is the nature of recovery going to be, is it going to be a sharp V shaped recovery, is it going to be more like a U shaped recovery as people talk about, where it's a slow start and pics up steam or it will be -- is it fits and starts where you get some recovery and some stabilization, and then another recovery and some more stabilization, and as you saw, I mean this varies across categories, and it does vary across countries. So there's a lot of variables here, which is why we've chosen not to give you any kind of specific forecast. We'll wait and see.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thanks for the clarity.\nAl Kelly: And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to email or call us and Investor Relations team.

In our time today, let me first touch on our results and then discuss how we\u2019re going to grow our core C2B or consumer payments business and capturing new payment flows, which is all part of our network-to-network strategies. To start, our first quarter results, we had a terrific quarter and the business is performing well. We reported net revenue growth of 10%. But if you adjust for exchange rates and very low currency volatility, our net revenue growth was approximately 13%. Our EPS growth was 12% or 14% on a constant-dollar basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions made after Q1 last year. Key business drivers were largely consistent with the fourth quarter as we expected. For the first time in our history, total network volume this quarter was over $3 trillion. Payment volume grew at 8% globally, 10% excluding China and the UK. Cross-border volume rose 9% on a constant-dollar basis and we processed nearly 38 billion total transactions on our network, up 11%. Let me touch briefly on holiday spending, starting with the United States, the growth was similar to the 2018 and 2017 holiday seasons, which were both strong years. Credit growth was slightly better than last year and debit growth slowed slightly due to lapping tax reform, which had a positive impact on U.S. debit growth throughout all of last year, including the holiday season. E-commerce grew three to four times faster than non-e-commerce. E-commerce also drove more than one-third of all consumer spend, up two percentage points versus last year. Retail spend growth was stronger than last year, fueled mostly by e-commerce. However, that was offset by slower growth in travel and restaurant spending. To give you a brief sense of the holiday season in the other major markets, Brazil and Canada saw slightly stronger growth than last year. The UK growth was similar to last year's level, and growth in Australia slowed slightly. Now let's look at the core business overall for the first quarter. We are growing our core payments business in three ways; through large clients and markets; number two, making progress to capture the opportunity in emerging and other markets through new partnerships, including wallets and fintech; and three, all while helping the ecosystem remove friction. We continue to have significant renewals and wins amongst some of our largest financial institutions. These have renewed our issuing agreement with Capital One effective January 1 of this year. We're very pleased to continue our longstanding relationship with Capital One. We recently renewed our agreement with DKB, our largest issuing bank in Germany, and we're looking forward to developing new service as a product within this exclusive innovation partnership. In the Caribbean, we\u2019ve renewed a multiyear contract with Royal Bank of Canada for credit and debit. This agreement also includes some new debit wins covering 17 Caribbean countries and territories. In Latin America, we're pleased to have won the credit and debit business for Santander in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. This leadership position with financial institutions also extends to the merchants, as we are a leader in co-brand with 13 of the top 20 portfolios globally. This quarter we could take it to solidify our leadership position. In the United States, we were selected for the new Venmo co-brand credit card reflection of our strong partnership with PayPal. The opportunity for this product is quite significant as Venmo has over 52 million users currently. We're excited to continue growing our longstanding co-brand relationships with Caesars Rewards and Harley Davidson. Sony has relaunched both of their co-branded credit cards connected with the Sony Rewards program. Together, Sony and Visa are partnering in a number of ways to grow these programs and bring compelling offers to their cardholders. We already had a strong relationship with Costco as their co-brand provider in United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Mexico, and just this corner secured the China co-brand. In Europe, Visa extended our co-brand partnerships with Norwegian Air Shuttle and S-Group, respectively. In CEMEA, we renew the Emirates NBD\u2019s credit business and half of that portfolio is represented by the Emirates Skywards co-brand program exclusively with Visa. And the rest of the portfolio is bank branded credit. Our wins are not limited to just large issuers and merchants as we continue to make progress to capture the opportunity in emerging and other markets through wallets and investments. In Africa, we have recently taken several steps to help accelerate the shift to digital payments. On the credential side, mobile money wallets are already prevalent across Africa. But without a virtual or physical debt or credential associated with them, many international online services are unavailable to users. To help solve this problem, we announced a collaboration with MFS Africa, which is Africa's largest digital payments hub connecting through one API to more than 180 million mobile wallets on the continent to distribute Visa payment credentials across the continent. In an effort to build acceptance, we recently announced an investment and partnership with Flutterwave, a Pan African digital payments platform that enables multipayment acceptance and processing. Together, Flutterwave will further scale its consumer payment service called Barter and its merchant acquiring service called Rave through Visa products such as Visa Direct, Visa QR and Virtual cards. In addition, Visa established its strategic partnership and will acquire a minority stake \u2013 equity stake in Interswitch, a company focused on the digitization of payments that processes more than 80% of domestic transactions in Nigeria, and sales payment processing across 23 other countries in Africa, and operates the largest domestic debit card scheme on the continent with 23 million cardholders. Our partnership will help accelerate Visa deployment of payment experiences, leveraging interswitches, processing and integration capabilities and scale their bill pay services across Africa. As we grow our business in emerging markets and with new players across the globe, we\u2019re ever focused on improving the point-of-sale experience and reduce the friction for the entire ecosystem. In the card-present environment, we continue to see meaningful momentum in tap to pay what we consider to be the most friction free way to pay in person. We have reached a point, where one in every three card-present transactions that runs over our network is tapped versus one in four a year ago this quarter. This past year, we doubled the number of countries, whose face-to-face transactions are at least two thirds contactless. Transit continues to be a key user case and an important way to habituate tapping behavior. In New York city on the MTA, Visa crossed two million taps in November, from the beginning of the pilot and three million in January. The MTA recently announced the tap to pay expansion to their entire system by the end of 2020. And we are currently pacing a 350,000 Visa taps a week on the MTA and nearly, one in every 10 transactions in the New York Metro area is a tap to pay on a Visa card. We also launched Africa\u2019s first contactless transit system in Johannesburg this quarter, in addition to launches in Ho Chi Minh city as well as Taiwan, Sweden, and Ukraine. In the e-commerce environment, click-to-pay or what we once called Secure Remote Commerce, speaks s to streamline the digital payment experience across networks offering greater security and improved sales. You may recall, we launched with a select number of merchants in October and by the end of December more than 40 merchants had adopted the new click-to-pay solution. Now that the holiday season is over, we recently completed the migration of 5,500 U.S. merchants to click-to-pay. We expect to complete the migration of the remainder of Visa Checkout merchants in the United States over the coming months. Additionally, all 50 million consumers, who are already enrolled with Visa Checkout, were automatically converted to click-to-pay. Globally, we continue to make progress on securing the ecosystem with tokens. Introduced in 2014, tokens have expanded into 107 countries equating to six billion tokenized transactions in 2019. We now have over 750 million tokens globally. Over the past 18 months, Visa Sign, it is now live with the majority of large e-commerce platform for card-on-file tokenizations, including Adyen, Raintree, CyberSource, PayPal, Stripe, as well as some big e-commerce companies including Amazon and Netflix, amounting to hundreds of millions of new tokens, which is accelerating the pace of e-commerce transactions now processed over the Visa token service. Collectively, we have secured merchant and partner commitments for tokenization in the e-comm space that will add up to approximately $1 trillion in Visa payments volume. Putting it together, our core business remains strong as we continue to win with traditional players, new players, and speak to remove friction. Outside of our traditional C2B business, we\u2019re making progress and capturing new payment flows. in the card-based B2B space, we had several wins in the first quarter. In Singapore, we\u2019ve won the government procurement card for Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation or OCBC with the Singapore government mandating the digitize payments by 2023; OCBC is targeted to capture a significant public sector procurement volume. Within the CEMEA region, Visa signed a partnership with NEC payments, a digital banking and payments processing platform to expand NEC\u2019s regional and international issuing business focused on virtual card for B2B payments such as travel and insurance. In Hong Kong, we partnered with Neat, a fintech offering digital business account services to be an exclusive partner with Visa\u2019s issue virtual commercial cards. Visa Direct serves P2P, B2C and even B2small business with over 700 million transactions in the first quarter of 2020. This quarter, we wanted to highlight significant progress in the B2B cross-border space. MoneyGram announced it is now live enabling international transfers that rely on Visa Direct, the new service, which has been available within the United States in September; it\u2019s starting with transfers to Spain and the Philippines. TransferWise, the global technology company for international payments will also begin offering its customers the ability to send, receive funds in real-time to Visa Direct. The integrated capability currently available in six countries including Spain and Poland will soon be available across more countries in Europe. Our continued progress with Visa Direct speaks to our network of network strategy, where consumers did business as in governments to move money to anyone anywhere, each new network endpoints be it a car, the consumer or a business account or a wallet, compounds the value of the capabilities we offer to partners and improves the customer experience through a single Visa connections. As I talk about network, it\u2019s hard not to mention Plaid, although I\u2019m not going to cover into too much detail until the transaction closes. We see Plaid is having the potential to deliver real value to Visa in multiple ways. We have received a number of questions on their revenue model. So, I thought I would cover it quickly. Similar to us, we have a usage base revenue model, pricing is structured on a pay per API call basis, and varies by product depending on the type of financial data consumed by the customers at the fintech, which speaks to the power of their network. We are truly excited about the acquisition. To close, we\u2019re off to a strong start in the first quarter with much to be excited about as we look forward. We are deepening partnerships with traditional players in markets and expanding assets with new players. We\u2019re removing friction in the ecosystem and we\u2019re making significant progress to capture new flow. This is all part of our network of network strategy as we continue to focus on clients and moving money globally, seamlessly and safely. I want to take a quick moment to mention our Investor Day on February 11 here in San Francisco, which will simultaneously be webcast. You will hear from for knowledgeable and deep bench of leaders will discuss our view on the evolution of the ecosystem and how we intend to deliver Visa\u2019s future growth to our customer \u2013 consumer payments business, new flows and value-added services. The formal presentations should run from about 8:00 AM to 2:30 PM Pacific Time and we look forward to your participation. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al and good afternoon everyone. We had a strong start to fiscal 2020 with results coming in consistent with our expectations, excluding acquisitions and investment gains, constant-dollar net revenue and EPS growth about 11% and 14% respectively. Exchange rates reduced revenue growth by over one point and EPS growth by approximately one and a half points. The four acquisitions completed in the last six months, increased reported revenue growth by approximately half a point and expense growth by approximately three points. starting in fiscal 2020, we're providing adjustments to our GAAP numbers each quarter to help investors\u2019 better track ongoing business performance. Non-GAAP results will exclude three items: 1) the impact of equity investment gains and losses 2) amortization of acquired intangible assets or acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2019 and forward, and 3) certain non-recurring acquisition-related costs. Prior non-GAAP results were also adjusted to reflect this change. this quarter, the impact of non-GAAP adjustments is de minimis. In addition, you will find a helpful schedule on the first slide of our earnings presentation. In addition to GAAP and non-GAAP results, we provide the growth rate impacts of exchange rates as well as the inorganic impact of acquisitions. in other words, the revenue expense and EPS impact that acquisitions had on our reported numbers this year, which were not in our reported numbers in the first quarter last year. A few highlights from the quarter. Key business driver growth rates, payments, volume, process transactions and cross-border volume that's stable and consistent with prior quarters. Net revenue grew 10%. However, the underlying growth trend in revenues is masked by two significant drags related to currencies. First, a stronger dollar reduced nominal net revenue growth rates by over one point. second, currency volatilities were at the lowest level we have seen in over five years. as maybe expected, the sharp decline in currency volatility had a significant impact on international fee revenue. If you adjust for the drag from unusually low currency volatility and the drag from the strong dollar, underlying net revenue growth is robust at approximately 13%. Constant-dollar payments volume growth of 8%, slowed by one point compared to last quarter. This trend \u2013 this change in trend is driven by differences in processing days when compared to the first and fourth quarters of last year. The processing day impact was over one point in the U.S. and several points in Canada. excluding the processing the impact, Q1 payments volume growth was similar to last quarter and second quarter service revenues associated with these volumes will be in line with our expectation. constant-dollar cross-border growth rates, excluding volumes within Europe, were also stable at 9%. our reported constant-dollar cross-border growth rates accelerated 2.9% as we are now lapping the pan-European e-commerce platform, which re-oriented acquiring across countries last year, converting transactions from cross-border to domestic. As we have discussed in the past, this shift at minimal revenue impact to Visa, has cross-border transactions within Europe, have revenue yields similar to domestic yields. We repurchased 13 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $179.71 with $2.3 billion in the quarter. Our board has authorized a new $9.5 billion share repurchase program. with this additional authorization and the $1.7 billion of remaining authorized funds as of December 31, 2019, we have $11.2 billion available for share repurchases. including our quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, we returned approximately $3 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Turning now to our key business drivers and financial performance. payments volume growth in constant dollars was 8%, credit was up 6%, debit was up 11%, growth excluding China and the UK was 10%. as a reminder, Chinese domestic volumes are impacted by dual-branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was up 8% with credit growing 7% and debit 9%. Excluding the processing day impact I described earlier, growth accelerated almost one point due to a partial lapping of the Cabela\u2019s conversion and multi-higher fuel prices. Underlying consumer spending growth was largely consistent with the last quarter. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 8% and 12% excluding China and the UK. Growth in CEMEA remains robust 22% with strong growth across Russia and the middle East. Latin America also remains strong at 17%, given by some wins and strong performance of existing clients. Asia Pacific excluding China grew 8% decelerating over two points primarily due to slow growth in Japan, Australia and Hong Kong. Europe excluding the UK grew 12%. UK growth remains weak and slowed one point after improving in each of the last two quarters. process transactions continue to grow at 11%. constant-dollar cross-border growth of 9% was up two points from the last quarter that\u2019s stable that 9% excluding volumes within Europe. Both travel and e-commerce growth were in line with the last quarter excluding volumes within Europe. Outbound commerce accelerated from Russia, Africa and across Europe, which was offset by weaker growth out of the U.S. and Asia. Inbound commerce accelerated a bit into the U.S., but decelerated a little into Europe, which is consistent with the weakening dollar, compared to the pound in Europe. Growth into China and Hong Kong remains weak. Net revenues grew 10% or 11% in constant dollars excluding acquisition. The impact of our acquisitions on revenue growth was approximately half a point. Service revenue growth is consistent with the last quarter at 9%. data processing revenue growth was also in line with the last quarter at 16%. international transaction revenue grew 9%, decreasing two points from the fourth quarter despite its smaller exchange rate drag due to the unusually low currency volatility. other revenues grew 22% slowing 13 points from the fourth quarter as we lap ASC 606 impacts from last year, partially offset by faster growth in our value-added services. client incentives were in line with our expectations at 22.4% of gross revenue, up 30 [ph] basis points from last quarter. As we told you in October, the expected client incentives to step up from our fiscal 2019 exit percentage, the lower end of our full-year outlook range in the first quarter due to the level of deal activity this quarter and last year. GAAP operating expenses were up 14%. excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets and nonrecurring acquisition-related costs from the four acquisitions that closed in the last six months. Non-GAAP expense growth was 13%. Personnel expense growth is primarily driven by increases in stuff to drive our growth initiatives, which we\u2019ve stepped up in the second half of last year. Acquisitions and some nonrecurring expenses also contributed to personnel expense growth. Marketing expenses decreased 1% due to the timing of some spending as well as the reporting change that shifted some expenses to the general and administrative line. The impact of acquisitions added two points from non-GAAP expense growth. Exchange rates reduced reported expense growth by approximately one point. Non-operating income/expenses include equity investment gains of $13 million, which we are now excluding in our non-GAAP results. Investment income also includes a small non-recurring benefit, which is exactly offset in personnel expenses with no impact on earnings. Excluding these non-recurring items, investment income is lower this year due to falling interest rates and lower cash balances. Our tax rate of 17.7% was lower due to some items that are unique to our first quarter each year. This was anticipated and reflected in our outlook for tax rate this year. Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. First, let me share business driver growth for the first four weeks of the quarter. Through January 28th U.S. payments volume growth was 10%, with U.S. credit growing 9% and debit 12%. Processed transactions grew 13%. Cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis grew 8% or 7% excluding cross-border volume within Europe. Cross-border volumes in the last two weeks of January are negatively impacted by the shifts in the Chinese new year with potentially some initial effects of the coronavirus outbreak. As we look ahead to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we\u2019re assuming stable growth trends on key business drivers, payments volumes, processed transactions, and cross-border volume. The exchange rate drag on net revenue in the second quarter could be approximately 1 point, 50 basis points better than our prior outlook and consistent with the first quarter due to some weakness in the dollar since September. More than offsetting the small benefit could be the unexpected drag from currency volatility. The unusually low currency volatility so far this fiscal year continues to persist into January. As maybe expected \u2013 as expected client incentives as a percent of gross revenue will climb to the upper half of our outlook range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Count by the extra day in a leap year, second quarter net revenue growth rates are expected to be in the low-double digit and modestly better than the first quarter. Our second quarter revenue outlook does not reflect the potential effects of the recent coronavirus outbreak in China. It is too early to assess this impact. Second quarter expense growth is also expected to be modestly higher than the first quarter. As we had indicated in October, expenses will grow at the highest rate for the year in the second quarter as marketing expenses ramp up relative to a low level of spend last year. Also as the dollar has weakened the exchange rate benefit on reported expense growth will be about 1 point, 50 basis points lower than we had anticipated in October. Our non-operating income/expense in the first quarter had a run rate of around $65 million, when you exclude the $13 million gain from equity investments and the small non-recurring benefit I mentioned earlier. The run rate of non-operating expenses will be somewhat higher in the second quarter due to lower interest income as a result of lower cash balances and lower interest rates. Our tax rate outlook for the second quarter remains unchanged at 19% to 19.5%. Overall, we\u2019re maintaining our outlook for fiscal year 2020. I will mention a few adjustments and trends that they're monitoring. On the net revenue front, we are still expecting low-double digit net revenue growth in constant dollars. Based on current exchange rate and future expectations, the currency translation drag could be at the lower end of our previous 1 percentage point to 1.5 percentage point range at approximately 1 point. The four acquisitions we\u2019ve completed in the past six months are still expected to add around 0.5 point of net revenue growth. As we highlighted in October, a significant factor impacting fiscal year 2020 net revenue growth is the unusually high volume of renewal activity. In fiscal year 2019 we renewed 30% of our payment volume, with 15% renewed in the fourth quarter alone. And we indicated fiscal year 2020 renewal activity could be front loaded, with another 15% to 20% of payment volume renewed in the first half. Since then, it has become apparent the renewal activity in fiscal year 20 could be even higher, with three to four large unplanned renewals now on a discussion. We could bring this year level of renewal activity almost on par with last year. We are pleased about this since in most of these situations, we will most likely not only renew our existing business but could also gain a larger share of these clients over the term of our new contracts. One major client renewal is already complete, and the other could get done in the next two or three months. As such, we now expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be at the high end of our outlook range of 22.5% to 23.5% in FY2020. Excluding acquisitions and last year\u2019s MDL-related special item, our outlook assumed four expense growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range in constant dollars or 7% to 8%. This climbs to low double-digit growth when you add in the four acquisitions we have closed on in the past six months, which contribute three points to four points to expense growth. Based on current exchange rates and future expectation, nominal expense growth is likely to benefit by one point. As such, our expense growth for the year is expected to be in the double-digits, with 50 basis points \u2013 which is about 50 basis points higher than we expected in October. As I indicated earlier, non-operating expense at a run rate of approximately $55 million in the first quarter. This expense will move modestly higher in each successive quarter this year due to declining interest income from lower rates. Our full year outlook for tax rates remains unchanged at 19% to 19.5%. Q1 tax rates were lower than the full year outlook due to some items that are unique to our first quarter each year and were largely anticipated in our full year outlook. Excluding the four acquisitions, our outlook for adjusted fiscal year 2020 EPS, constant-dollar growth remains in the mid-teens, built off fiscal year 2019 EPS of $5.40. Four acquisitions are expected to dilute EPS by $0.05 or $0.06 a one point drag on EPS growth. Based on current exchange rates and future expectations, exchange rates could reduce EPS growth at approximately one point. Including the acquisition and exchange rate impacts of 2 points, our outlook for adjusted fiscal year 2020 nominal EPS growth would be in the 12% to 14% range. We still expect for the fourth quarter to be the highest EPS growth quarter. Our fiscal year 2020 outlook does not include any impact from the planned acquisition. We will update our outlook when we have more clarity on the timing for closing on the transaction. When we announced the acquisition, we gave you some preliminary estimates of revenue and earnings of revenue and earnings implications for fiscal year 2020 and 2021. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: We're now ready to take questions, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, good afternoon, guys. So just wanted to start on the incentive side, I mean the guidance change here is really only half a point, I mean if people were previously modeling the middle of the range. I'm just wondering if you expect to make up for that half a point through better gross revenue or does it feel more like you just may land net revenue slightly lower within that overall unchanged low-double digit guidance range, especially since the currency volatility has fallen off as you guys pointed out?\nAl Kelly: Yes, a couple of things, Jason. Yes, we'll see how incentives play out for the year, but the way it looks right now, the renewal activity will be higher and so we are signaling that it could be at the upper end of the range. And as you said, if people are in the middle of the range, that's up a point higher. On the other hand, we are signaling that if exchange rates stay roughly in the range they're in on where people are expecting, that is about at the lower end of the range too. So you pick up some of it there. In terms of currency volatility, we were able to absorb most of it in the first quarter and still get very close to as you saw what our expectations were. We're factoring that into our second quarter outlook. What is going to be for the second half? I think we'll wait and see. It's not something you can predict further out and the time will tell.\nMike Milotich: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nDan Dolev: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So a quick question on cross-border, it looks like a nice uptick. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Well, I guess, remember last year, Dan, you had a number of things going on, especially at the back end of the quarter with a government shutdown, Brexit, U.S.-China trade talks, et cetera. So we were expecting some uptick off of some of those factors that had a negative impact on cross-border at the time. And so we're back up in what I think we would expect to be a fairly normal range at this point.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks so much. Everything was really consistent here, but just looking at the regional volumes, just a couple of questions or clarifications. On the Asia front, it looks like it\u2019s slowed to the 4% zone. Curious what was the outlook here based on what you see? And then with Europe, I'm pretty stable, soften and tends to go low end of the 8% to 9% range. But I know you guys have made a lot of investments there. What are your expectations for European? Can you sort of break out of this zone based on some of the investments you've made? What do you see there? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Yes, I might start and I'm sure we'll add. In Asia, we highlighted three areas. Japan was really more of a quarter-over-quarter comparison. There were some changes in consumption taxes in Japan that seemed to push some spending into the period ahead of the tax going up. So it was pushed more into the last quarter. And so it's \u2013 we don't think that's an ongoing issue. The other one was Australia. Australia, you had some of the wildfire impact. And that seems to be one of the bigger factors there. And last was Hong Kong, and you saw \u2013 you know what some of those are. We have seen impacts in Hong Kong from some of the protests going on. So that was pretty much it. Across the rest of Asia, the trends are very good. In Europe \u2013 UK is a big chunk of our business and the UK has been very weak and actually slowed through the elections and had a very relatively weak holiday season and slowed by a point in the quarter. If you take the UK out, growth was a pretty healthy 12% in the rest of Europe. The only thing \u2013 I'd add two points, Tien-Tsin, one is the consumption tax that Vasant referred to. Now the government has decided to re-date some of that consumption tax when people do contactless transactions in Japan as part of the government's push on the cashless going into the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. So that actually going to turn out to hopefully be a good thing, not only stimulate spending, but to stimulate tap-to-pay spending. The other point on Europe; as Vasant rightly pointed out, the UK has been a bit of a drag for us, but we've been extremely focused on the continent and had some \u2013 we've had some good wins in fintechs and some good renewals. And those things are in the pipeline and I feel pretty good about where Europe's going to head over the next couple of years in terms of growth.\nMike Milotich: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller: Hey, thanks, guys. Just a couple of quick ones. One is on the, look, the improvement in volume we're seeing in January seems to really underscore the comments you made around like nuances in Q \u2013 calendar Q4, like the processing day. Just if you can comment on what you're seeing in terms of the consumer given, are these improvements into January just timing or do you actually see a healthier type of spending trend? Al, just one quick follow-up also was around the rebates incentives given, so many are being done now. Can you just comment on the types of returns you're expecting to see for those? Are these longer contracts than they used to be? Are they coming with more value added offerings? Something along those lines would be great.\nAl Kelly: Well, I think Darrin other than in the UK consumer has held up pretty darn well. And our volume in this last quarter when you factor in the processing day change, which is kind of a bit of an anomaly, but if you look in September, the last day of September in 2018 was a Sunday and a lot of merchants that acquires whole volume on a Sunday. So what ended up happening, a bunch of one day worth of \u2013 a lot of volume for one day got pushed into the first quarter of 2019. We did not have that same phenomena this past quarter because the last day of September this year was a Monday. So we just simply had a dynamic that it was \u2013 was hard to grow over. And so when you actually adjust for that, our growth quarter-over-quarter was pretty similar. So in general, I think the consumer has held up quite well and there's no reason to see it go down other than, again, depending upon where this coronavirus ends up going and who knows at this point. Just to be clear, when you have to have rebates and incentives, when I was referring to the rebate, that was a rebate being given by the government in Japan. I don't know whether that's what you\u2019re referring to. But in general, we are trying to obviously strike the right balance in terms of incentives that we do in deals, try to make many of them as many of those incentive dollars growth-oriented as possible so that as partners\u2019 volume picks up, their incentives picks up, but we're also getting the associated volume with them. And as \u2013 it\u2019s probably no guarantee, we obviously push for contracts that are as long as possible. There's \u2013 to some degree, most of them kind of fall in a five- to seven-year cycle. Every once in awhile there's some 10-year deals. And then there's issuers that like to do deals every couple of years and those would tend to be more of the issuers that have dual issuers. So, it\u2019s always a bit of a balancing act to try to get to the right level, but I think we try to structure these incentives in smart ways, where they\u2019re growth oriented, they\u2019re focused on consumption of different numbers of Visa products, and try to build relationships with issuers that go well beyond just an issuing relationship to encompass Visa Direct to encompass tokenization, et cetera.\nMike Milotich: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys. I wanted to ask about Capital One, I know Mastercard also announced a renewal with Capital One. So maybe, you could help us sort out of that contract breaks and if this is a net positive for both networks. And then just secondly, Vasant, on expense growth, I think your comments last quarter was expected to be similar to the fourth quarter, which I think was around 11.4% that came in a little bit higher. Was there any pull forward in expenses, because I think operating margins at the street we\u2019re expecting were a little higher than they came in. Thanks so much.\nAl Kelly: Bryan, let me just try to point on Capital One and then I\u2019ll let Vasant comment on acquisition. Look, Capital One has been a classic dual issuer and it \u2013 always, it depends on what portfolios each network happens to have and how they perform at any given point in time. But there were big terrific banks with a lot of innovative people on your team. We love working with them. and so it\u2019s a good thing for us and I\u2019m sure that next, I would say it\u2019s a good thing for them as well.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Expense growth was a couple of points higher than we might have expected. Some of it is exchange rate. So, as you saw, the exchange rates were somewhat better than \u2013 the exchange rate impact was somewhat better than we expected on revenues, which means on the expense side were somewhat worse, I think that was about a point. And as we \u2013 as I indicated in my comments, there were a few other non-recurring types of things that added another point. So, in general, they want any real surprises, they will pull forward of investments that it was just a couple of these kinds of items.\nMike Milotich: Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nTrevor Williams: Hi, good afternoon, and appreciate you taking the question. This is a little bit higher level, but I\u2019m curious internationally with a couple of government-backed systems like Mir in Russia and Troy in Turkey that mandate domestic processing. I guess first just, how you see your role in the economics you can earn in both of those markets over the longer term. And then second, more broadly, if you\u2019re comparing today\u2019s backdrop to, I don\u2019t know, five or 10 years ago, just what kind of threat you guys think nationalist\u2019s payments agendas could pose to the international business going forward? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Trevor, some of these domestic \u2013 our processing platforms with domestic teams are not terribly new. Our objective is to work closely with both regulators to make sure it\u2019s an even playing field and then work closely with our clients to make sure that we get a fair share of business. Many times our processing network of VisaNet actually just playing a simple has a lot more richness to its various offerings. And people we\u2019ve had cases, where banks see that and preferred to process with us, because of the investment, the level of security, level of innovation. So, we\u2019ll continue to be up against this kind of \u2013 this backdrop, but I think, it\u2019s still allowing us to grow at healthy levels and we\u2019re trying to partner in a thoughtful way as much as we can. Your question about the backdrop on nationalism today versus and years ago, I think you\u2019d have to say, it has become a little bit more pronounced simply, because it wasn\u2019t that nearly as prominent, a decade or so ago. But again, I think our job is to continue to innovate more closely with regulators and with our clients to have as much of an even playing field as possible and continue to show that processing on Visa or minimally partnering with Visa as your team has good advantages to it that people want to work with us.\nMike Milotich: Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Al, if I look at a long-term history of your growth versus your largest competitor, it\u2019s been quite stable more recently though the last one or two years, you\u2019ve seen some Delta open up between your metrics and your peers. So, can you talk about some of the drivers of this and more importantly, if you look out next few years, can we expect the gap to narrow, because of what you\u2019re doing with fintechs internationally in order to strengthen Visa direct?\nAl Kelly: Thank you, Harshita. Look, both companies that perform extremely well on a number of dimensions, look at the most recent quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with our results. And look, Mastercard had a great quarter and they\u2019ve had some good quarters, the last couple of years as have we. That said a few points, first of all, volume metrics are \u2013 don\u2019t have any standards attached to them and it\u2019s really difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison between the two companies and really understand what\u2019s going on fully in terms of the volume. On the revenue side, revenue Deltas have been a bit smaller in a number of the recent quarters is huge mix differences in our business. We\u2019ve had a very big position in the United States and we want to trade that for the world. It\u2019s just playing simple and much more mature market that doesn\u2019t have the same high double-digit, mid double-digit, even over 20% kind of growth prospects to it. But we\u2019re certainly pleased to have the partnerships with the banks that we have in the position that we have in the United States. The last one I\u2019d make is I \u2013 my expectation is based on the investments that we\u2019re making in value-added services, in new payment flows, in working with fintechs, working with neobanks, working on engagement with our existing customers, building out our effective footprint that I\u2019m quite confident that overtime, we\u2019ll close that gap and continue to perform very well for our investors.\nMike Milotich: Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon guys. A question on Visa Direct, you mentioned the greater than 700 million transactions in 1Q. You\u2019ve highlighted previously the Visa Direct was growing in the triple digit. So, I guess question one is it still growing that rate and then also how are the yields tracking in Visa Direct? I mean, is it sort of comparable to debit? I know there\u2019s a lot of cross-border in there too. And last one, Al, related to Visa Direct, I promise that you mentioned a few new partnerships as you complete the Earthport integration. What are some of the major use cases for Visa Direct you\u2019re seeing rolling in as we move through 2020? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: So, first of all, Lisa, our growth of Visa Direct remains incredible. It didn\u2019t quite get the triple-digit growth this quarter, but it was a very, very high single-digit, double-digit and close to that level. In terms of yields, we really haven\u2019t talked much about it. but to your point, this addressing is going to increasingly have some more cross-border transactions that will run over that, that platform and that our push platform. and that is obviously a very \u2013 a very good thing for us. I think when we talk about use cases, I think they\u2019re going to fall into some of the same topics they fall into today P2P disbursements, remittances and I think that those businesses will continue to grow. And you\u2019ll see on Investor Day that we\u2019ll highlight a good number of Visa Direct use cases with quite a few specific examples. So, we look forward to taking you through on 11th.\nMike Milotich: Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good afternoon. Given the ongoing weakness you\u2019re seeing in UK volumes and the incremental one point deceleration you called out, could you update us out on your growth pivot moving employees out of London and into some of the higher growth markets of Italy, Poland and Germany, and when might this growth pivot accelerate your volume growth in Europe?\nAl Kelly: So, David, we don\u2019t have any active plans to kind of move people out of the UK. We\u2019re just playing simple as we grow the business, adding employees on the continent and certainly, adding the vast majority of employees, where we would add in that region or in market offices on the continent. First, I\u2019d also comment that I\u2019m certainly hopeful now that at least there is some clarity around the Brexit outcome that we might find a new normal in the UK that would allow their economy to pick up. Certainly, I was in Davos last week and certainly, the officials in the UK that I talked to feel as if it\u2019s on the verge of starting to come back. We\u2019ll see what happens. in terms of the continent, in many of these markets, we\u2019ve been behind playing simple. And over the last four or five quarters, we\u2019ve been \u2013 after we got the integration behind as we started in investing in fairly significant ways and we\u2019re winning deals and trying to build our credit business, build our acceptance footprint. And so it takes a little bit of time for the pipeline to work its way into the numbers. But I think over the next couple of years, we\u2019ll start to see some real payback for the progress that we\u2019re making now on the continent of Europe.\nMike Milotich: Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I appreciate your commentary on the coronavirus, but I was wondering if you could dimensionalize the cross-border China business and maybe, any impact it may have and sort of how you could address it? And then secondly, on the three to four unplanned renewals, is there any context as to why it\u2019s happening that banks are choosing to renew early? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: So, on coronavirus, it\u2019s \u2013 let me start, it\u2019s certainly just too early to know. When we look at our numbers, we see some declines. But Chinese New Year this year was earlier this week, January 25, and last year in 2019, it was February 5 and spending slows around the holiday. So, we\u2019re given that we\u2019re about 12 days earlier this year, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s really impacting the volumes at this stage. As said, that\u2019s definitely going to be impacted. I mean, when planes are being halted both in and out of China, and you\u2019re probably reading as we are that companies were telling their employees to stay home. So, even for the e-commerce world, employees are staying home, who\u2019s picking and \u2013 who\u2019s picking goods and shipping them. So, I think for sure, there\u2019ll be some impacts and \u2013 but we\u2019ll have to see how pronounced it gets and how long it goes. I\u2019m not into predicting game for that at the moment. In terms of the early renewals, what tends to happen is probably about half the time, it\u2019s us and half the time, it\u2019s the client, who says as we\u2019re talking to them about deepening our relationship and we\u2019re talking about to them about all the dynamics that are going on in payments and/or we\u2019re talking to them about building a deeper relationship by them consuming more and more of Visa\u2019s capabilities and solutions. If a deal is going to be up in a year or a year and a half or two years \u2013 excuse me, that\u2019s no longer than that. But if the deals are going to come up and say you haven\u2019t had the two years or less, one of the two of us also the client will say, why don\u2019t we just get our deal done and extend it out a number of years, so that we can focus on all of these capabilities and we can work together on trying to grow the business versus starting down a path, where we\u2019re starting to consume \u2013 the client is starting to consume more Visa products. And then we have to halt everything while our teams on both sides go into negotiation mode and it just goes down the wheels of progress. And I think what\u2019s happening, because payments is just more complex than it was four or five years ago, and the number of offerings is greater than it was, even two or three years ago. I think that this is what\u2019s kind of driving this, I don\u2019t want to call it a phenomenon, but driving this occurrence. and this year, as Vasant said in his remarks, there are four decent-sized financial institution that were not scheduled to be up this year. They were not built into our numbers or incentive. One of them is already done, I referred to it in my remarks, which we saw then they on the deals that we did with them in South America. So there's three others where there's live discussion going on right now and it's too early to tell whether a deal definitely gets done or not, but my expectation is that more likely than that, at least a couple of them that were not planned will get done.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please?\nOperator: Next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the acquisitions that you've been doing, and perhaps the changing reporting, what that may indicate. In the past, Visa has done a lot of investments in companies and fintech, et cetera, even before fintech was coined as a term, but it seems like you've picked up, at least in the last year the pace of acquisition. Is this part of \u2013 should we expect more acquisitions and you'd be more active in actually acquiring companies that then you have been the past? Or is this maybe a little bit anomalous? Just wondering how you're thinking about incorporating some of the development that's happening outside Visa into Visa proper?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, I think I will add some more things. We'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but just a quick response to that question. I don't think we are deliberately stepping up the level of acquisition activity or investment activity in some kind of change of direction. Our approach has always been, we build any core capability and if it is faster or cheaper or the talent that we can get from the outside that would be valuable. Then you would consider acquisitions and there's a logic to every one of those we did. On the investment side, typically, when it's complementary capabilities, we prefer to partner and we do lots and lots of partnerships, as you know. Business has built on partnerships. Occasionally, we get into a situation where a company may like us to invest or we want to invest because we do want to enhance our relationship, get closer, have a better commercial agreement, get some exclusivity and so on. The reason the volume has gone up to some degrees because as you know, there's a lot of activity nowadays in terms of companies with business models and capabilities that are very valuable to us, either as capabilities for us to own or capabilities to partner with. So it reflects what's going on in the marketplace too. And it will \u2013 the pace of activity will depend on exactly applying the criteria I just mentioned. It could go up if we find more than meets our criteria or it could go down.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. Al, you went through a pretty exhaustive list of breaking down core versus new flows and then reduced friction has kind of three big tenets of growth. Where I'm trying to, I guess parsed out, how do you break those down? I mean, it's core like 80% of the growth as we think about the next couple of years. Then layering in these other two to three assets? Or how should we kind of parse out that as we kind of think through all of these opportunities for you? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Well, yes, Dan, on Investor Day, we'll talk a lot about all three of these. To be very honest, we don't have a debt mix that we're trying to get to across the three items that you cited. We're trying to make sure that we do as well as we possibly can against all three, to try to make sure that we're delivering a sustained good level of revenue growth. And some of it will depend on what's happening at a particular point in time and economies and where we end up choosing to put investment dollars. So there's a lot of factors that go into it. But we're not setting out to hit some certain mix. We're setting out to do a really good job in our core business. We're doing to try to extend the business through new payment flows and value-added services. And with the acquisition of Plaid extend of business and our network and network business even further. So that's really what our objective is. Dan.\nMike Milotich: And one last question Jordan.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is now open.\nDave Koning: Hey guys, thank you. When we look at cross-border, the reported volume growth all through last year was pretty slow and I know that has to do with just currency, right? But the revenue growth was way, way above volume growth. This quarter volume growth has gotten better, but the disconnect, I guess between volume and revenue has gotten smaller. Like that gap between volume and reported revenue growth has gotten smaller. Why is that? And should it be closer? Should it stay closer like that throughout this year?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, the delta between volume growth and revenue growth are driven by a variety of factors. The most important of currency related, right? Most of the time the delta is driven by currency impacts. Clearly pricing plays a role. So there was some pricing in there that was causing the revenue growth to be faster than volume growth. Currency effects can then move in one direction or the other. And then when volatility is moving in a big way and this quarter, we had a very big move. If you're looking at volatilities, we are at five years lows now, not seen since 2014. Historically, those have corrected over time, so that we think is a transient thing. But when volatility has declined, the revenues related to those volatilities are also in that line. And this quarter those had a big impact. If volatilities were the same year-over-year, our revenue growth would have been fairly comparable to last quarter on the international fee line.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Jordan.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Jennifer, thank you very much. And good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. In the fourth quarter and throughout Fiscal 2021, Visa's delivered strong results against the backdrop of economic uncertainty and the lingering impacts of the COVID pandemic.  In doing so, we demonstrated the resiliency of our business and validated our growth strategy as we continue to drive the rapid growth of digital payments and enable innovation in money movement globally.  A quick summary of Q4 results. Fourth-quarter payments volume was a 121% of 2019 up about 0.8 points from Q3 and up 17% year-over-year despite the backdrop of a global pandemic this quarter.  We also set a record with total global payments volume of $2.8 trillion. Cross-border volume, excluding intra -Europe, was 86% of 2019, 4 points better than Q3 and up 46% year-over-year and process transactions were a 124% of 2019 up 4 points from Q3 and up 21% year-over-year.  Our net revenues grew 29% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was a $1.62 up 44%. And talking too many of you over the last few months, I know you're wondering what the head for Visa and the payments ecosystem as we emerge from the pandemic.  So rather than doing my usual report card on the quarter, I'm going to speak more broadly today about the four key reasons why we believe that these as even better positioned for growth than before the pandemic: 1. there's still enormous opportunity ahead in consumer payments, 2.  We continue to enhance our network of networks capability to facilitate money movement more seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem and accelerate the penetration of new flows. Third, value-added services simultaneously help our clients leverage our scale and sophistication while diversifying these as business and driving more volume. 4.  We enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps to accelerate Visa's growth. So let me start with number 1, the enormous opportunity in consumer payments. We see that the pandemic has helped to further digitize cash.  In the last 12 months, global debit Cash volumes, which are primarily the amount of cash withdrawn from Visa debit cards has increased 4%, while debit payments volume has grown 23%, both on a constant dollar basis. In 2021, the number of monthly active e-commerce credentials and spend per active credential continue to grow strongly.  For example, in the U.S., monthly active credentials and active spend per credential both grew by more than 20% on average versus 2019. We've grown credentials for both traditional and new players to 3.7 billion up 7% year-over-year. After renewing client contacts that represented 55% of our payments volume in the previous 2 years, we renewed contracts that represented 20% in 2021.  Let me just highlight a few of those deals in Q4. In our Asia-Pacific region, we renewed 3 of these as top 20 issuers, including China Merchants Bank and Bank of China. And in North America, we renewed 3 of the top 15 issuers. PNC renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit at small business credit and debit portfolios.  Regions also renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit at small business credit and debit portfolios. And RBC and Visa have ventured into a renewal of their agreement with respect to the issuance of credit, debit and prepaid cards in Canada. Fintechs have also fueled our growth.  In the last year, nearly 30% more fintechs issued Visa credentials, and they have more than double their payments volume. Furthermore, fintechs are scaling. Robust, growing acceptance to more than 80 million merchant locations up 14% year-over-year. And when you include small businesses behind players like Stripe and Square, the number is north of a 100 million merchant locations.  We've grown top to pay to 70% of all face-to-face transactions globally. Excluding the U.S., we have more than 70 countries with over 50% contact with penetration. U.S. penetration is now over 15% more than double from just a year ago with 400 million cards; quadruple what we had 2 years ago.  We know from other markets that tapping brings increased spending and transactions while digitizing cash. We also continue to innovate to make it easier for partners to access and utilize our platforms and capabilities.  One recent example is Visa Cloud Connect, which enables clients to connect to VisaNet via the Cloud, eliminating the need for investment in local data centers, telecommunications infrastructure, and any specialized payment hardware. To summarize, consumer payments as an opportunity, and Visa's credentials, acceptance, and innovation that make us feel confident about our ability to accelerate growth in the future.  Moving now to our network of networks, we continue to enhance our capabilities to facilitate money movement seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem while accelerating the penetration of new flows. The total new flows opportunity is $185 trillion. Payments infrastructure, regulations and settlement systems, are all very local in nature, which creates a lot of complexity in a world of global trade.  Our network of networks capability enables Visa as the single connection point to help clients to move value domestically and cross-border over all networks including Visa's own networks, RTPs -- ACH is a new network in the future, like stable coins and public blockchain. In FY '21, we continue to build out Visa directs global reach surpassing 5 billion transactions across 500 programs in nearly 550 enablers, such as acquirers, processors, banks and fintechs.  In the U.S. alone, nearly 120 million cards have sent or received funds using Visa Direct. Visa Direct is unique as it is more -- has more endpoints and more used cases compared to the next competitor and offers flexible technology. Our growth plan for Visa Direct focuses on four key levers. First in trench existing use cases. P2P is our largest use case and an FY 2021; we surpassed 200 P2P programs globally.  An insurance disbursement is another use case, and this quarter we added nationwide to begin distributing claims. Second, we want to capture the cross-border opportunity for cross-border P2P during the fourth quarter, we added pay send, and soon Western Union's U.S. customers will be able to send funds to eligible Visa cards in the Philippines, Thailand, Colombia, and Jamaica, followed by a robust expansion plan for other countries.  The odd remittances we're also leveraging our cross-border capabilities for marketplaces, supplier payments. Student tuition payments and more. Our third lever to grow is scale the over 20 live use cases. Recent examples include, tipping, fund raising, brokerage account funding in airline vouchers, and in the fourth quarter, we added Yardi in the rental space area for property managers to distribute the security deposits.  Finally, scale new markets. Visa directed scaled rapidly in several markets, but there are many more where the market conditions are right for acceleration. For example, in Peru, we have a strong P2P footprint and are now adding new use cases like the innovative payrolls solution launched in partnership to?swell.  We have? Salary on-demand provider that also seeks to improve financial inclusion. Globally, we have more than quadruple the number of earned wage access providers on our platform since 2019. In short, we are just scratching the surface on Visa Direct and expect to drive rapid growth in the years ahead to capture the $65 trillion market opportunity. We also have many examples of partners utilizing Visa Direct and our B2B capabilities.  This quarter we're pleased that BIM will offer their 400,000 plus business customers the ability to make B2B payments via Visa Direct and through Visa virtual cards. We also have wins with Credorax in Europe for travel through a new commercial card agreement and through JPMorgan's participation in Visa's commercial pace solution.  These initiatives will support virtual card capabilities spur growth in new payment flows and drive incremental volume over time. Visa B2B Connect now operates in more than 100 markets and offers a multilateral network with distributed ledger technology that addresses the pain points of existing solutions, which include transparency and speed.  We're also pleased to have launched a partnership with Citi to be a global settlement bank for Visa B2B Connect, which broadens the endpoints available for clients to include Citi's business accounts for moving money cross-border, and their clearing capabilities for banks that have not yet been integrated into the B2B Connect network.  Given the size and breadth of Citi and our role in facilitating money movement, we're very excited about this capability to expand the Visa B2B Connect network. Looking ahead, open banking plays a V essential role in the network of networks. We believe Visa can accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe with our pending acquisition of Tink. Together we can provide a secure, reliable platform for innovation that can be expanded globally.  Whether it's leveraging account data for value-added services or facilitating account to account or paid by Bank money movement. Open banking creates opportunities from Visa to offer our clients and partners a one-stop shop for money movement, security, data, and valuable customer experiences. Blockchains also will continue to expand our network of networks.  Our settlement capabilities on our continued innovation around Crypto APIs and services have been key to winning new partnerships. We have nearly 60 crypto platform partners with the capability to issue Visa credentials, and there -- we're already capturing over 3.5 billion of payment volume in FY21.  The third reason we're even better positioned for growth post COVID is value-added services, where our scale and sophistication simultaneously help our clients be more successful while diversifying Visa's business and driving more value. Our value-added solutions differentiate Visa's network enable our clients to adapt to the changing payments ecosystem and deliver valuable services across other rails, enhancing our network and network capabilities.  In 2021, 40% of our clients used 5 or more value-added services and nearly 30% use 10 or more, which is up from 20% in 2020. Let me highlight a few services that have grown significantly in 2021. Cybersource added 28 new acquirer partners and 45,000 merchants. As a result -- and as a result, we're growing payments volume twice as fast as our broader client base and our risk solution on Cybersource called Decision Manager grew over 30%.  We have doubled the number of tokens over the past year to 2.6 billion and enhance the capabilities to manage them through Visa Cloud token across more than 8,600 issuers and 800, 0000 merchant\u2019s tokens have led to a 2.5% increase in approval rate and a 28% reduction in fraud rates.  These adept authorizations and Visa Risk Manager utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, which helped reduce fraud by $26 billion screening 30% more transactions in 2021 than in 2020. All of our efforts in authentication, risk, and identity and authorization optimization have led to cross-border card-not-present approval rates increasing by nearly 2% in the past year.  Therefore, value-added services revenue grew 25% in Q4 and also drove additional volume. Since the pandemic began, our bags revenue has averaged the quarterly growth rate in the high teens and was approximately $5 billion in FY '21.  Finally, the fourth reason that we that we believe we have great room to grow is, that we can enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps accelerate Visa's growth. These as past, present, and future about fostering innovation and enabling new partners capabilities than used cases.  We enable the disruptors -- we help them scale. Disruptors are good for payments at good for Visa. Given our role in the ecosystem, we don't pick winners or losers that we're well-positioned for growth across many potential outcomes. Let's take Wallets as an example. Wallets have done a tremendous job of building a user base in some cases building acceptance.  But at some point they reach a point where they are seeking a digital growth and many of them are embedding Visa credentials in their wallet. So the consumer can use anywhere these as accepted, as well as receive and send cross-border P2P payments. Line pays an excellent example with four portfolios totaling 5.6 million Visa credentials across 3 countries, including a new co-brand in Thailand that was launched in the fourth quarter.  Buy Now Pay Later or BNPL is a newer example. But we think we'll have a similar outcome. While installments are fast-growing, there just a fraction of the total industries payment volume estimated to be about 100 to 150 billion. But we are bringing scale to disruptors. We have a two-pronged strategy where we provide a network solution as well as solutions for our BNPL, Fintech partners.  The network solution offers issuers the ability to extend installments to their existing credit clients and merchants to offer a seamless installment option to their customer with flexible terms; we continue to expand our partnerships in Q4 with HSBC in Malaysia, Moneris, Canada's largest payment processor by volume, and ANZ in Australia with 2022 large volumes.  We also partnered with fintechs in a number of ways. We generate revenue as customers pay their installments with a Visa card through virtual cards for B2B or consumer payments, and through value-added services. The majority of the installment payoffs are on cards today. For example, in Canada over the last year, the number of Visa cards used to repay installments has grown more than 300%.  We believe we're currently experiencing BNPL 1.0. Individual fintechs and companies are cutting individual deals, merchant by merchant. Eventually, we believe the business model we evolve to BNPL 2.0 data with fintechs partners issue Visa credentials to leverage our acceptance and platforms to overcome the difficulty of scaling acceptance globally, merchant by merchant.  We're already seeing this evolution begin to take shape. Just this quarter, Florida signed a global brand deal that accelerate expansion at scale into several markets. So to close, Visa is better positioned than before the pandemic to capture the opportunity ahead supported by the strong growth in consumer payments, the scale of our platforms, network, and capabilities, and new flows and value-added services becoming a greater portion of our revenue.  And as cross-border volumes return over the next 2 years, it will only help to further drive our growth. Furthermore, over the history of our Company, we've demonstrated that our innovation, willingness to partner, and compelling and competitive offers have made our business resilient and successful.  With that, I will now turn it over to Vasant to review Q4 and also provide a view of what we believe these -- all these opportunities mean for Visa's financial performance in the coming year. Vasant, over to you.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon everyone. Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of two very different halves. In the first half, net revenues declined 4%, and non-GAAP EPS was down 2% as we lapped a pre -COVID first half of 2020. In the second half, the recovery was well underway, and we were lapping some of the worst 2020 COVID impacts. As a result, net revenue grew 28%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 43%.  Fiscal's fourth quarter results were better than we expected with net revenues up 29% driven by strong U.S. domestic trends. Robust value-added services, growth, and higher cross-border volumes from a faster than anticipated recovery in travel. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter's payment volumes, net revenue growth would have been approximately 22%.  GAAP EPS grew 70%, including equity in Investment gains and a one-time non-cash tax expense last year. Non-GAAP EPS rose 44% helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shift increased both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 0.5 a point. In constant dollar, global payments volume was up 17% led by continued strength in debit, as well as improving credit spending.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, global payments volume was 21% higher, 0.8% point acceleration from Q3, with debit slowing 1point, and credit improving by 3 points versus Q3. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 18% or 26% higher than 2019, and a 1 point acceleration from the third quarter.  China domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded [inaudible 00:19:57] conversion, which are minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume was up 30% over 2019, consistent with the third quarter. Credit improved 3 points to 17%, about 19 helped by consumer small business and commercial spending.  Debit closed 4 points, but remained very strong at 44% about 2019 without much benefit from economic impact payments. Card-present spend improved 3 points to 15% of our 2019, its highest level yet in the pandemic, driven by higher fuel and restaurants spending.  Card-not-present volume excluding travel, slowed 6 points to 53% over 2019 at some food and drug spending shifted back to card-present, and retail spend was not as strong without the benefit of stimulus payments. International constant dollar payments volume improved 3 points from Q3, up 15% over 2019 levels.  A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 58% from 2019, accelerated 10 points from the third quarter with robust performance across the region fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our EMEA region remains strong, up 48% from 2019 levels consistent with Q3, also fueled by cash digitization and client wins.  Europe was up 20% from 2019, improving Q3 points from Q3 due mostly to strong performance across Continental Europe, Asia-Pacific remains our weakest region, up 5% from 2019 and consistent with Q3, excluding China. Many countries instituted restrictions in the quarter including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Singapore, but all have started to recover in the past few weeks.  India payments volume has fully recovered from the severe COVID outbreak in Q3. Global process transactions with 24% over 2019, improving 4 points from the third quarter as transactions improved faster than volume. Tap to pay penetration increase in many markets and ticket sizes started to return to normal in the US.  Visa Direct transactions grew 35% down from the 50s in the previous 3 quarters. This quarter, we lapped a very strong Q4 of fiscal year 20 when Visa Direct hit 1 billion transactions for the first time. Stimulus payments have ended and we're lapping the COVID-related spike in P2P, which is moderating U.S. growth rates.  Meanwhile, the international business is ramping nicely, as well as growth from new skills such as cross-border remittances, earned wage access, and marketplace pay out. Across broader volume, recovery continued as more countries open their borders, while e-commerce spending, excluding travel, remains strong.  Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe was at 86% of 2019 volumes, a 4 point improvement from Q3, driven by the continued recovery in travel that started in May. Cross-border card-not-present volume excluding travel, continue to be very strong at 43% above 2019, declining 13 points from the third quarter, but consistent with Q2. As a reminder, the boost we saw in Q3 was primarily from cryptocurrency purchases.  Cross-border travel-related spending excluding intra -Europe versus 2019 improved 13 points from Q3 to Q4. It has risen from 40% of 2019 in April to 50% in June, to 61% in September. In terms of air travel, related spending is improving. The flights in Asia-Pacific outbound spend in each region is indexing at similar levels versus 2019 and each improved by between 10 to 20 points in Q4 versus Q3.  The largest improvements were in Canada, the Middle East, and across Europe. Europe in-bound spend improved by 24 points versus 2019 as popular travel destinations such as France and Italy relaxed their border restrictions. As we've seen consistently during the pandemic, there is pent up demand for travel as bookings accelerate when the borders opened.  Latin America remains by far the strongest destination, well over 2019 levels. U.S. to Mexico travel remained robust with spend more than 60% of our 2019 levels in Q4, Asia-Pacific remains mostly closed and did not meaningfully improve in the fourth quarter, remaining below 30% of 2019, both inbound and outbound.  Moving now to a quick review of fourth quarter financial results, service revenues grew 41% consistent with 39% nominal growth in third quarter payments volume and helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 20%, in line with 21% trusted transactions growth with a small impact from unfavorable country mix.  International transaction revenue were up 41%, 7 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding into Europe due to lapping, high-currency volatility last year and unfavorable regional mix. Other revenues grew 36% led by consulting and data services, as well as travel benefits.  In total, value-added services revenue grew 25% led by security and identity, as well as consulting and data services with some benefit from COVID-related lapping effects. Client incentive is lift 26.7% of gross revenues in line with our expectations.  The 90 basis point increase from Q3 was primarily driven by strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America and fewer adjustments for underperformance in certain geographies, partially offset by improving cross-border volume. Operating expenses grew 15% in line with our expectations. Marketing expenses grew 58% in the quarter as we stepped up spending and also lapped reductions in Q4 last year.  Personnel and professional services spend also accelerated as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We recorded gains from our equity investments of 101 million excluding investment gains, non-GAAP, and non-operating expense worth 118 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax matter.  GAAP EPS was $1.65, non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 44% over last year. We bought 13.2 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $231.33 for 3.1 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned over 3.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. On October 22nd, Visa's Board of Directors authorized a 17% increase in the quarterly dividend to $37.5 per share.  For the full-year, net revenues increased 10%, and non-GAAP EPS of $5.91 was up 17% the return 11.5 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 39.7 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $219.34 for an $8.7 billion and by paying dividend of 2.8 billion.  Before we discuss the year ahead, let me share performance through the first 3 weeks of October. U.S. payments volume was up 32% about 2019, consistent with September with debit at 44% and credit at 22% about 2019. Process transactions were 26% about 2019. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis was 94% of 2019, which is up 8 points from Q4 and 2 points from September.  Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 4 points compared to September to 65% of 2019. Card-not-present non-travel was 49% about 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter and down 2 points from September. Looking ahead to Fiscal Year 2022, our business has been on a recovery track for the past 3 to 4 quarters.  However, we're not back to normal yet globally. There are many factors to consider as we project the trajectory of the recovery. Debit and e-commerce outperformed and stay resilient even if credit recovers and in-store shopping returns. The full impact of stimulus payments and support programs ending remains to be seen.  Cross-border travel is recovering well, but still well below peak levels with the pace of recovery depend on cross-border -- on border openings. Asia has not reopened to the degree the rest of the world has. The timing of reopening in key countries across Asia, both domestically and for cross-border travel is a key variable.  Most importantly, COVID variants are still with us and vaccination rates remained low in large parts of the globe. With these factors as the backdrop for casting the trajectory of the return to normalcy remains difficult. Visibility, 4 quarters out, while improved, is still not great. For the past few quarters, we have been providing you our best sense of the business one quarter at a time and we will continue that practice in fiscal year '22.  Assuming current trends are sustained through December, you would expect first quarter net revenue growth in the high teens. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are likely to be in the 26% to 27% range, in line with the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. Sustained investment spending combined with low comparable last year, leads to operating expenses continuing to grow in the mid-teens.  Non-operating expense is expected to be in a 120 to 130 million range and tax rates in the 19% to 19.5% range. Looking for quarters out projecting growth, revenue growth poses the greatest challenge, in a significantly dependent on the pace of the cross-border travel recovery, as well as the other factors I just mentioned. It is all a function of your assumptions for these variables.  In order to be helpful, we will share the assumptions we are making for internal planning purposes. For domestic volumes and transactions, were assuming no disruptions from COVID-related lockdowns. As such, we assume that the recovery trajectory underway in payments volume and process transactions stays intact through Fiscal Year '22.  Cross-border travel, we assume that recovery underway continue steadily through Fiscal Year '22 to reach 2019 levels in the summer of 2023. We assume the index to 2019 climate from around 60 currently to around 80 by September 2022. We also assume the strong growth in cross-border e-commerce continues.  We expect new flows and value-added services growth in the high teens. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to range between 26% to 27% for the year, consistent with the fourth quarter, Fiscal Year '21 level. Pre -COVID, this percentage increased by 50 to 100 basis points each year due to the impact of new deals and renewals.  In Fiscal Year '22, we expect to benefit from revenue mix improvement as cross-border travel continues to recover; partially offset by the lapping of incentive reductions we had in Fiscal Year '21 due to the COVID impact. These assumptions result in high end of mid-teens net revenue growth for Fiscal Year '22, including over 0.5 point of exchange rate drag from the strengthening dollar.  First quarter growth in the high teens will moderate through the year, as we lap the recovery in Fiscal Year '21. As I said, these are our assumptions for internal planning purposes. We will continue to provide our outlook for the business one quarter at a time for Fiscal Year '22.  In terms of the other elements of the P&L, we expect operating expenses to grow in the low-teens in fiscal year '22 as we step up investment across all 3 lines of business to lay the foundation for sustained higher growth post-COVID. We're already increased marketing investment. We will invest heavily in our technology platforms to continue to enhance functionality, flexibility, security, and reliability.  We will invest to sustain the high growth we have in our new flows and value-added services business. And we will continue to add resources in-market to help our clients utilize all of our new capabilities. Expense growth will be higher in the first half and moderate in the second half as we lap the resumption of investment spending in Fiscal Year '21.  Non-operating expense is expected to be in the 120 to 130 million ranges each quarter, and our tax rate for the year is also expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range. None of these assumptions include tinker Currencycloud, which we expect to close in the first half of the fiscal year. They will not be material to Fiscal Year '22 revenue or non-GAAP EPS.  Visa remains a network of choice for innovative and money movement. We enabled the innovators and disruptors. We help them scale. And in turn, innovators drive our growth. We have continued to enhance the functionality and flexibility of our network to substantially expand the money movement use cases we saw, supporting the new-generation of fintechs as well as driving growth in our new flows business.  A value-added services, our differentiation, and create more value for our clients than alternative networks can. Our network of networks strategy substantially increases our loans, which we believe can create more value for all network participants than any closed loop or geographically limited network.  As we said at our Investor Day, we have a 10x growth opportunity ahead of us, and we are well-positioned to capture it. We ended Fiscal Year '21 the good momentum, a high-growth, resilient dividend e-commerce business, recovering credit and cross-border travel, and new flows and value-added services on newer growth engine driving further acceleration. With that, I'll hand it over to Mike Q&A.\nMike Milotich: Thank you Vasant. We're ready to take questions, Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson, you may go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Al, I wanted to follow up on number 2 on your list that was related to Visa's network of networks. You highlighted open banking as one area that you view as a positive for Visa because it enables new flows and value-added services.  It's often perceived, so actually that open banking as a negative for Visa because it can shift volume away from debit. Can you just elaborate on this point and how Visa benefits from open banking? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thank you, Lisa. Look, I think -- first of all open banking as you know is in its early stages. We believe by jumping into the middle of it, that we can help the ecosystem determine what is the best routing for different transactions. There are certainly are transactions that will lend themselves to A to A kind of approach which we know is one of the things that people will think about as a threat.  But there are an awful lot of transactions, many transactions where people appreciate the protections that are provided by a network like dispute resolution, fraud security, and the like. When money is moved instantaneously that's nice at one level. But if once it's moved, it's awfully hard to get it back and it's much more about other elements than just speed.  We also think by getting involved with Tink we are right at -- and have the opportunity to really learn as we go and we think that there is an opportunity to potentially provide value-added services even on transactions that might route over a different network. So I would say, Lisa, the bottom line is you could see some transactions that are incremental, that might move off these or off of our normal rail, but what the way we look at it as by leaning in, we're going to learn more about it and we're going to be able to influence what's happening and will also be able to make sure that we can provide other capabilities and value-added services to the various transactions.\nOperator: Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: David Koning from Baird, you may go ahead, sir.\nDavid Koning: Oh, yeah. Hey, thanks, guys. One thing I noticed was the last 6 years. I looked at the fiscal years and every year, U.S. volumes grew the same or faster than rest of world volumes. Maybe discuss a little bit. I know COVID the last year generated some of that, but as we look over the next 5 or even 10 years, A, does that reverse, and B, as part of the U.S. growth, just all the new fintechs stuff that's happened in the US, just creating a lift that is allowing kind of that outpacing?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think David; it's a combination of things. It's certainly is the explosion of some of the neobanks and fintechs. Although you're saying those really developed all the way around the world, I would also say though that our Visa Direct platform is much more mature in the U.S. than it is in other markets besides somewhat alluded to that point in his remarks, and that has certainly helped spark some of the growth as well.  I also think that the U.S. had -- prior to the pandemic at least been more advanced in e-commerce capabilities. And was much adjusted even more quickly than other markets might have. As we saw a rapid move towards cash digitization as COVID set upon us in March of 2020. All that said, we are setting out to invest around the globe and we want our business to grow in all markets and territories in which we do work.  We are more than happy to have the U.S. continue to grow, but I think as I look at the future of the business over the next 5 to 10 years, I expect still healthy growth in the U.S., but I do expect our volumes to continue to grow in a nice way around the world.  I mean, you saw this prior quarter as good as the growth was in the U.S. in the quarter, both Latin America and CEMEA had very, very strong quarters. And International growth was really held back by Asia-Pacific, which is really been hit very, very hard by lockdowns and restrictions as a result of the pandemic.\nVasant Prabhu: One other thing I might add as you look ahead, I mean, all the things Al said that even international is a little held back right now is because Asia, which is almost 20% of our payments volume is only growing at the levels -- low-single-digit levels, because they are largely still not open. The one thing to think about as we look ahead, as we said earlier, that Al said on his comments, contactless payments are already 70% penetrated outside the U.S.  So that's still a growth engine in the U.S. that is just beginning to take off and given the size of the U.S., that will be a meaningful contributor to transactions growth. And we also know that Tap to Pay digitizes cash and allows us to capture a much larger share of transactions at the point-of-sale.\nDavid Koning: Thanks, guys. Great.\nOperator: Thank you. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead, sir.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. I want to go back to one of the comments that you made as it relates to Buy Now, Pay Later in the growth of that, and how you see that as a growth avenue for Visa. Can you talk a little bit?  I think I conceptually get the idea of expanding acceptance and the advantages that this can provide there, but if you provide a little bit more color of like how you think that evolves and what those transactions will look like in a way that will benefit Visa? Thank you very much.\nAl Kelly: I think in the short-term, James, we're seeing many, many of these players use us and use our credentials, whether they're virtual cards or debit or credit card to actually pay off the various installments. And so we're getting instead of one transaction, we're getting four transactions. And certainly that's very good for us.  The point I was making is that in many ways, BNPL is a closed loop capability; somewhat it came to what Wallets were 3 years ago. And close looks just end up hitting a wall. They don't end up -- they end up hitting a wall where it's hard to scale, it's hard to bring the level of depth of choice that you can add to your customers.  And so what I think is going to happen is that BNPL players will become issuers who will issue Visa credentials that we'll have the, their value proposition for installments embedded within the product itself.  So that they can therefore scale very, very quickly by immediately having access to the 100 million merchants that I referenced in my remarks. And so that's what I believe based on history is going to happen and that's what I'm referring to when I say BNPL 2.0.\nJames Faucette: That's great, Kelly. Thanks, Al.\nOperator: Thank you. Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW, you may go ahead, sir.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. So the reopening of the U.S. border should be a pretty big catalyst for you guys. I'm just curious if you guys are seeing anything in terms of bookings that's giving you any perspectives on the trajectory that you outlined. And maybe what's assumed inside your expectations. Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: The U.S. border, the inbound to the U.S. maybe referred to the fact that international revenues have not grown as much as international volumes. Lots of the reason is the inbound travel has been quite strong into the CEMEA region and Latin America, which have been quite open. And it has improved quite a bit in Europe.  And because of the U.S. being largely restricted for inbound travel other than for U.S. citizens inbound to the U.S. is still -- it's better than Asia, but it is -- I'd say weaker than any of the other regions, Ex - Asia. So that's a clear upside there. It is a higher-yielding corridor, and so clearly there will be benefited there as the travel from Canada, travels from Europe is permitted. In general, I mean, it's hard to predict the mix.  It is incorporated in our views of how cross-border is going to improve. Cross-border travel, for it to go from what we said to the levels we are assuming at the end of fiscal year '22. You would have to assume improvement inbounds to the U.S. and that's all part of the equation.\nMike Milotich: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. You may go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. And I wanted to follow up on your comments and enabling disruptors as they could try for Visa. As we're seeing this rise of two-sided networks around the world, digital wallets, buy now pay later constraints, super apps.  And you talked about them becoming newest issuers of Visa credentials or something that you're already seeing. Do you think they also pose risk if they use account-to-account payments that open banking at the funding mix in terms of cost longer term? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Again, my view on all of these new players has always been that we assume they can be additive to the ecosystem, and we assume that we can be helpful to them. And so we lean into all of these new players very, very early. It's one of the reasons why we had the position we have right now in crypto where we have partnerships with over 60 players because we leaned in right from the beginning.  And all of them have the capability and many of them are already issuing these credentials. I think some of these players will help continue to digitize payments and take money away from cash. I think that it's extremely likely that some transactions will be A to A, but there's A to A transactions today, a lot of regular bill pay is for all types of purposes A to A. So I'm not really sure.  It's that that new bigger deal, but that said, we think that we're in a far better position to buy leaning in and working with these players. And if we don't actually have the transaction on our net. Network or we're out of the processing of the transaction overall, there's still the possibility of providing other capabilities from our tool box of solutions in value-added services to bring to the party.  So how it's all going to play out, we'll have to see, but I'm optimistic that the position that we're taking, which is to lean into all of this is going to put us in the best place to be successful.\nVasant Prabhu: Our approach on network of networks strategy is fundamentally to go to people with solutions that can meet all their money movement means. And we've told you about how we do it with a variety of players. Whether it's cross-border remittance providers, we allow them to do account-to-account, account-to-card, and card-to-account, any which way they can. We make it easy for them with one connection to get them money wherever it needs to go.  In effect, we get your money from point A to point B. The entire journey may not be on our rails, maybe part of the journey are on some other rails, but we can get it there and we provide all the things you expect from Visa, which is the trust our brand brings the reliability, the flexibility, the security, the dispute resolution, and all those capabilities. So fundamentally, it's all about solution providing -- about providing solutions, and not just about rails.\nHarshita Rawat: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Hey. Thanks, guys. It's kind of a two - sided question, but first is on the medium to long term. When we look at debit being stronger, understanding obviously an acceleration on e-com and just the other structural positives you've seen with cross-border 94% of '19, even with travel, it only 65 services strong.  I just be curious if you can touch on what you see structurally sustainable about these higher than probably what you'd expect pre -pandemic trends, standing versus not. And then when you think about your '22 qualitative look, what would you say were the areas you would try to build in the most conservatism into the outlook in terms of macro assumptions?\nVasant Prabhu: I think the first question. First. So in terms of the structural changes that have happened -- that are sustainable, the cash digitization engine is clearly extremely healthy. And that is a big driver of debit, because debit is the first gateway to digital payments that consumers use. And we've seen that debit has sustained its growth almost globally.  Even as we have seen, card present come back and reopening happen and similar statements go where there's been quite a bit resilience to debit strength helped by Visa Direct too. So all indications are that the cash digitization engine, especially in emerging markets, is really taken off because habits are being formed and people have gotten used to using digital forms of payment.  So we think there's quite bit resilience there and as evidence of that, even as things have started to normalize. The shift to e-commerce too has been remarkably resilient. We've seen -- if you see the charts we send out with our press release, you can see card-present has a pretty decent recovery in the past few quarters.  And if you look at how well e-commerce has held up. Card-not-present has held up. Again, there's been quite a bit of resilience there. Many new categories, people have gotten used to doing using e-commerce. And the biggest thing is cross-border e-commerce. Cross-border e-commerce has been extremely resilient.  If you look at it, it's indexing in the 140s. We saw a spike last quarter because of crypto currencies, but its back into the 140s as it was in the second quarter, which is very hefty growth compared to its prior growth rate. And it has held up even as cross-border travel is coming back. And even as card presence spending is coming back. So those 2 structural changes have shown quite a bit of resilience.  Once you look past those our value-added services have held up extremely well through the pandemic. If you look at the average growth in our value-added services over the past 6 to 8 quarters when we had the pandemic, it's been in the high teens. And our new flows businesses have been extremely high growth too. We're expecting high teen\u2019s next tier.  So those two new growth engines have shown quite a bit of resilience all the way through the pandemic. And that clearly lays a great foundation for the future as they become a larger and larger part of our business. If they're growing faster than our core consumer payments business. So that's a structurally higher growth rate because they are larger part of our mix.\nOperator: Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead, sir.\nBryan Keane: Hi. Good afternoon. Al, some of your peers have decided to buy the ACH rails and Visa has decided not to take that strategy and rely more on Visa Direct. So I was just hoping you could give us your latest thoughts on not needing to own the ACH rails and how it stacks up versus competitively versus what you guys have on Visa Direct.\nAl Kelly: Well, whether it's -- Bryan, whether it's ACH or RTP rails, they're -- is available to us as they are to anybody else. And we don't believe that we have to operate them in order to be successful in our network of networks strategies.  We think there's other places to spend our time and our money and core to what our view is, is that we want to be the traffic cop and facilitator and enabler so that we -- a sender can provide us the funds and tell us where the destination is around the world and through Visa Direct or B2B Connect, and utilizing for the first or last mile at ACH network or an RTP network gives us a great capability to reach what we believe is an unprecedented level of endpoints around the world that we think very, very much a differentiator.  And Visa Direct beyond its reach because we're using our Visa net platform, offers incredible operating scale. It allows us to leverage our value-added services that operate on VisaNet. So and we've had great success in commercializing the capabilities through the various use cases that I referred to in my remarks.  So we think the place to invest is in the capabilities to move funds seamlessly with great transparency and good economics, and continuing to invest there is where we take the smart thing to do.\nVasant Prabhu: I might just try to; perhaps clear up what maybe a misconception in the question you asked. Most ACH rails are owned by bank consortiums, the central banks around the world. You might be referring to -- if I think it's the competitor you're referring to they -- that's the RTP rails you're talking about and they don't own the rail. The RTP rails are typically always owned by bank consortiums, essential banks.  They are in the business of building the rails and then handing them over. And then in some cases, operating the rail, which by the way as I said opens to everybody to use a regulated rate. So the competitive you're referring to does not own RTP rails to the best of my knowledge anywhere. They have, in some cases, the opportunity to operate them in return for building them.  In some cases, they just build them and move on and they're not proprietary rails. They're open to everybody including us. And we looked at it hard and we concluded that the business of building these rails is not an attractive business. And the business of using these rails and the business of adding value-added capability as intelligence through these rails is a good business, and that's the business that we choose to be in.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thanks for the clarification.\nOperator: Thank you. Trevor Williams from Jefferies, you may go ahead, sir.\nTrevor Williams: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on yields in data processing. I know there are a few moving pieces in there, but was a little surprised this quarter to see those ticked down by a few percent from the September quarter, despite the improvement in cross-border.  So I think it'd be helpful just to get a sense of what the main variables or there I think from Vasant\u2019s comments, it sounds like there was just some country mix, but as we look to 4Q and 22. Just with the expectation that travel keeps working back towards the 2019 levels, like you guys have embedded just I mean, how much can that yield line benefit next year? And if there's any pricing that we should be thinking about rolling on next year with that, thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: I'm not sure there was any yield impact. If you just look at first of all, on the data processing line, both volumes and revenues are -- there's no lag, right? So the revenue should move in line with volumes in the quarter. And it did this quarter. I believe it was 20% and 21% or something volumes in net revenues. So they moved in line.  So there really wasn't really any change in yield. Now, clearly, the cross-border business is, relatively speaking, still recovering and below where it was, and therefore, the yields have been impacted by the mix shifting away from cross-border, and the mix improving is clearly helping the yields. But from one quarter to another, the yields were relatively stable.  There was nothing unusual going on there. I'm sure after the call, if there's any confusion, Mike and Jennifer could clear it up. But my short answer would be the yields are just fine and there was nothing unusual there.\nTrevor Williams: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\nTien Tsin Huang: Thank you so much. [Indiscernible] getting late, I just want to ask as you put your internal budget and investments together for fiscal '22, aside from cross-border recovering, what products or initiatives [Indiscernible] side are you most excited about this year? I know you lead with the 4 points about bigger picture growth been thinking about just near-term products and initiatives that we should be focused on.\nAl Kelly: I'll go with that, Vasant respond as well, Tien - Tsin. Look, I think you know each of the last 3 or 4 quarters, we've seen the recovery take more shape and I think there's --I'm in -- I feel very good about the way the business is advancing right now. I think consumer payments is positioned to stay strong, but in response to the question, a few questions ago, I think e-commerce is going to sustain.  I think Tap to Pay is going to sustain. We're starting to see some of the benefits of our acceptance footprint in places like Latin America grow and we're starting to see more of a shift to PV and away from cash throughout that region.  So consumer payments is still bread and butter for our Company and growing credentials, growing acceptance points, and continuing to work with our issuing partners on engagement and getting the most out of their existing customer base remain a very, very high priority for us. And I think we've gotten really good traction on our two other revenue streams in new flows and value-added services.  And I'm -- we've got a new flows value Visa Direct. We've talked a bunch about and feel very good about that. And I think as the world starts to see people return to the office and travel start to return, I think that's going to help the B2B space. And I think a lot of what I commented on in terms of wins and advances and value-added services in Fiscal '21 will continue into Fiscal '22.  So I think in short I like the fact that we've got a more diverse business model and more leverage to pull. Of course, we want to continue to plant flags and geographies where the business is still are payments and money movements a little bit more, more nascent. But all-in-all, I'm quite bullish on how the business looks as we enter Fiscal '22. Vasant, you want to add to anything?\nVasant Prabhu: Sure and then just to sort of give you a sense of where all the investment money is going. I mean, the broad team is we have substantially expanded the services we offer. The use cases we serve. And so what that means is we are investing significantly to continue to make our network more flexible. Add more functionality. Every day, our network is getting more flexible and adds more capability. We are substantially more services now to sell to our clients.  And there are many new types of issuers and new types of acceptance points. So significantly increasing the number of sort of the boots on the ground closest to our clients. So there's a big investment in the ground closest to clients to make our clients easily incorporate these services into their business, and also to bring in all these new types of fintechs if you want to call them, the innovators into our ecosystem.  The third dimension also is broadening of our brand. You've seen our new brand positioning. If you have watched the Olympics, you couldn't have missed it. It reflects where the future of Visa is.  It's not just about consumer payments. So there's clearly an investment in making sure that that message gets across. So broadly speaking, it's enabling new U.S. cases, new geographies, new clients, and repositioning the whole brand for essentially the leader in money movement.\nTien Tsin Huang: Thank you both for the update.\nOperator: Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse, you may go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks a lot for taking the question. I'll make this a little bit more of an industry question, but out alludes to something you mentioned earlier in terms of consumer protections, charge-backs to speed processes associated with card-based transactions. Maybe you could just talk a little bit broadly about in terms of, of course, there are many account to account and bank-based payment methods that are out there globally.  Generally speaking, what types of protections do they have, if any? And then the follow-up to that is how Visa can potentially work with some of those account-to-account and our bank-based payment methods to help add some of this in terms of the scheme, the process, the protections, security etc.\nAl Kelly: Well, the protections are very important. People tend to be on the biggest consumer protections that we think about are obviously fraud, making sure that consumers are not liable for fraud and charge-back protection that if you order a red large shirt and you get a blue medium one, that the ecosystem will stand behind you and either get you a replacement or get your money back.  To the best of my knowledge, Tim, I don't think that the A2A options offer any of those kinds of protections to consumers today that I'm aware of. And I think we'll have to see as A2A advances and as we get deeper into open banking, particularly starting in Europe, which is really ground zero for open banking. And obviously one of the reasons why we're excited about owning Tink.  We'll have to see whether we think that there's a way for us to step into try to help provide some of those protections for A or it could well be that A2A just has a different profile for our profile of protections or lack thereof for those transactions versus transactions on the run on network like Visa.\nTimothy Chiodo: Excellent. I really appreciate that context. Thank you so much Al.\nMike Milotich: We have time for one last question Michelle\nOperator: Thank you. Ashwin, Shirvaikar from Citi. You may go ahead, sir.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. So I mean, less than I think it was in your comments you mentioned sustained higher growth post-COVID and unpack this along the lines of U.S. versus non-U.S. in some of the debit versus credit parts. So that was quite helpful, my question is what the margin structure looks like as the revenue structures. First normalized and then possibly steps up beyond what was historically.\nVasant Prabhu: Looking at the average operating margins for the Company, as we've said before, our general view is that our goal is to grow volumes and revenues based on the opportunities available which we -- which as we've discussed are significant. And then we invest what it takes to do that. Margins are an outcome and not an objective.  Our business does tend to have a high fixed cost structure, the marginal transaction comes a low marginal costs. Value-added services businesses have good margins. New flows businesses have good margins. Yields and margins are different. The new flows businesses can have different yields than our core payments business.  But given that it leverages, the infrastructure and it's very much a scale business does come with very good margin. So you saw what happened to margins this year. We had a nice improvement from the drop we had in the COVID era. So net-net, I mean, we don't see anything vastly different from a margin perspective in the future, it will still be driven by the same factors. As I said, it's an outcome, not an objective.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Understood. Thank you.\nMike Milotich: Well, thank you, everyone for joining us today. If you have additional questions, feel free to reach out to myself for Jennifer and we're happy to help you. And thanks again and have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host from Investor Relations, Ms. Jennifer Como and Mr. Mike Milotich. Ms. Como, you may now begin.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Michelle. Fiscal third quarter 2021 earnings call. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge the filing was a little later than usual due to an issue, but hopefully, you had opportunities to review prior to the call. Joining us today are Al Kelly Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A reply will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlight has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ materially as the results of many factors.

For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliations are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAlfred Kelly: Thanks, Jennifer. Good afternoon. Thank you for joning us. We had a really strong fiscal third quarter as payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volume, all approved globally. In our time today, I will first cover our results, and then discuss our performance to date across our three growth levers: consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. The first Q3 results, net revenue rose 27% or 39% if service revenues were recognized on the current quarter's payment volume. This growth far exceeded our expectations due to the strength in the U.S., improving cross-border volumes and lower-than-expected client incentives, largely due to deal timing. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.49, up 41%.  As we look at volumes of transactions, keep in mind that year-over-year growth rates are less indicative of performance and the business trajectory due to the COVID-19 impact. So once again, we provide metrics compared to 2019 on a constant dollar basis as well as year-over-year growth rates. Payments volume was a 121% of 2019, which is up 5 points from the second quarter and represents a 34% year-over-year growth rate.  Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe was 82% of 2019, 7 points better than the second quarter, and up 53% year-over-year. The process transactions were a 120% of 2019, up 4 points from Q2 and up 39% year-over-year. Vasant will provide more color on our results, so now let me transition to progress relative to our business strategy efforts across our three growth levers helped to fuel strong results while positioning us to capture future opportunities.  In consumer payments this quarter, we saw a favorable secular trends and had a number of wins with large issuers, co-brands and fintechs. Cash displacement trends continued this quarter. Globally, cash volume on Visa debit credentials. The dollar amount of cash taken out of ATMs was 98% of 2019 levels flat on Visa debit credentials, was 140% of 2019 levels, up 5 points from Q2. While debit remains strong and has accelerated since Q2, credit spending is now also improving. Global credit payments volume was a 104% of 2019, up 4 points from the second quarter.  At the same time, face-to-face payments, volume trends are stable to improving, while eCommerce or card-not-present remains elevated. When we average across our top markets where we process versus 2019, we see card present improved 10 points, with card-not-present, excluding travel improved 1 point in Q3 over Q2. Travel is starting to recover both domestically and in cross-border. Again, averaging across our top markets, where we process versus 2019, domestic travel spending improved more than 20 points in Q3 over Q2.  Globally, cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe versus 2019, improved 6 points in Q3 over Q2 and exited the quarter with June at 50% of 2019. Simply looking at the absolute levels, it was a record quarter for these with $2.7 trillion in payments volume and payment transactions per day globally, which is up $60 million per day from the last quarter and nearly a $160 million transactions per day from a year ago. And we expect much more recovery to come, especially in the areas of credit and cross-border travel.  Tap-to-pay is a key accelerator for many of these trends, including face-to-face spending in both credit and debit. We continue to see countries increasing tap-to-pay limits. For example, in Brazil, the limit was doubled five months ago and the face-to-face tap-to-pay penetration has already more than doubled from 6% to 14% in that short period. In the United States, this quarter, we surpassed $370 million tap-to-pay enabled cards and we now have three cities above 25% face-to-face tap-to-pay penetration: New York, San Francisco, and San Jose. Merchant progress continued as well. Target has doubled its tap-to-pay penetration in the last year to two out of every five face-to-face transactions, and Costco 's U.S. gas stations have reached 40% penetration in tap-to-pay payments, since enabling this feature, approximately six months ago. Now shifting to clients. We continue to win with large issuers globally. Let me share a few examples from the quarter. In the United States, we're pleased to have renewed our long-standing partnership with Navy Federal Credit Union, the largest U.S. credit union with over 10.5 million members for a multiyear credit, debit, and processing agreement. Also in the U.S., Google Pay introduced the Visa Virtual Card that links to U.S. Android users' global pay balances, enabling these users to spend their balances at stores. In Italy, we extended our agreement with Banca Sella, part of the Sella Group, the largest private and independent banking group in Italy, for the consumer credit and commercial portfolios with plans to launch a new innovative digital credit small business solution.  In Singapore, we're expanding our strong partnership with DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia. We have [Techinical Difficulty] and we will continue to grow in the DBS debit portfolio. Latin America, we renewed the HSBC debit portfolio, one of the top five portfolios in Mexico. In our CEMEA region, we won the consumer credit portfolio of Qatar National Bank, the largest financial institution in the Middle East and Africa, and we renew the credit portfolio of Saudi British Bank, one of the largest Saudi Banks. We're also building momentum as the global leader in co-brands. In the U.S. alone, we have 7 of the top 10 co-brands And this quarter, we're pleased to renew higher than the U.S. and renew and grow the Williams-Sonoma co-brand, which will be relaunched with an expanded scope across the Williams-Sonoma brands, including Pottery Barn and West Elm. We secured a new co-brand relationship with PayPal in Australia and MercadoLibre, the largest e-commerce retailer in Latin America. In partnership with Banco Itau, we also won the co-brand business of Magalu, a major retailer with one of the largest co-brand portfolios in Brazil. Finally, in the Asia-Pacific region, we have secured a significant part of LINE Pay's business, with a partnership renewal and Taiwan, the largest co-brand program in the country. Fintechs are also core to our consumer payments growth. And this quarter, we forged new partnerships and deepened relationships with long-time clients. I just mentioned LINE Pay in Taiwan and we also continue to see strong momentum in our partnership with LINE Pay in Japan and with LINE BK in Thailand. Over the last year, they have added more than 2 million Visa credentials across those markets. Likewise, in India, longtime partner, Paytm, has issued 6 million virtual Visa debit card. In addition, they've recently started to issue physical Visa debit cards, which they expect to ramp up over the coming months. Kakao Pay, one of the top three mobile wallet providers in Korea with more than 30 million users, recently signed on to issue Visa credit cards. In the Middle East, we're partnering of STC Pay, the fintech subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's largest telecom operator to embed [Technical Difficulty] STC Pay wallets.  More than a million Visa credentials have been issued since September of 2020.. Rappi, Latin America's Super App with over 70 million users, has now started issuing Visa credit cards in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Peru, with plans to expand to additional countries in coming months. And at the crypto space, we recently signed three partnerships: one with Tala, the partner on cryptocurrency solutions for the global unbanked, and two with crypto exchanges, FTX and CoinZoom to begin offering Visa cards.  We now have more than 50 crypto wallet and platforms up from 35 in Q1 and more than the next leading network. And collectively, they drove over $1 billion in payments volume [Technical Difficulty] represents a significant engine of growth. The market opportunity in new flows is 10 times greater and we continue to make progress in our efforts. We had several capabilities within carded B2B that have been gaining traction. Our freedom solution enables corporates to control and monitor corporate card spending and expand to new use cases, including payables and virtual card capabilities.  Across Australia and New Zealand, we have renewed our long-standing partnerships with ANZ Bank for Freedom\u2019s expense management capabilities as well as NAB and BNZ to deliver expense management and payable solutions. And in the United States, Wells Fargo will deliver these capabilities to their corporate clients as part of our partnership we announced earlier this year. Visa\u2019s commercial pay, which offers a mobile app enabling virtual card issuance and management of business incidentals with enhanced data, will be part of OCBC Bank\u2019s virtual purchasing card offering in Singapore.  Visa Direct transaction growth remains robust with nearly a 0.5 billion more transactions this quarter than in the third quarter of last year. We continue to see large banks enable Visa Direct payouts for their customers, including CIBC this quarter. In the payroll category, ADP, a leading global technology company, providing human capital management solutions, recently integrated its wisely offering with Visa Direct to provide ADP clients with a digitally-enabled, convenient, and cost-effective solution for employee off-cycle payments. In the P2P space, the WhatsApp payment feature, powered by Visa Direct and Visa Cloud Token Framework, launched in Brazil in May. And we're seeing early success with a significant number of Visa credentials enrolled and sizable growth in P2P money transfers. PayPal announced instant transfers for merchants settlement and P2P via Visa Direct in Australia. We also developed new use cases this quarter for Visa Direct. First, GoFundMe is integrating Visa Direct to soon launch funds disbursement to individuals and organizations. Second, Questrade, the Canadian brokerage platform, announced the launch of Instant Deposit, allowing investors to fund their trade accounts in seconds. Let's now move to our third growth lever, value-added services, where revenue growth grew 28% in Q3. Let me discuss our efforts across a few of our capabilities. First, installments. In addition to investing in and partnering with numerous installment providers globally, we've also developed our own solution, which had some notable progress in the quarter. In Canada, Scotiabank is extending their post-purchase installments offering to -- they're offering to eligible Visa retail credit clients. CIBC is launching installments during purchase and Desjardin, North America's largest financial cooperative will be offering during purchase installments for their eligible Visa customers. In addition, Global Payments is enabling on installment solution for their merchant customers. Second, CyberSource, our omni-channel gateway platform has grown as a result of three drivers: one, increased e-commerce and omni-channel volumes; two, more business creating online and omni-channel presences, while leveraging our risk tools; and three, more acquirers, white labeling the solution. This past quarter, top 20 U.S. acquirer, Paya and Qatar National Bank, both signed to utilize CyberSource\u2019s capabilities. Third, DPS. I mentioned the processing agreement earlier with Navy Federal, they intend to utilize DPS. In addition, Current, one of the fastest-growing U.S. fintechs with nearly 3 million members have selected Visa DPS as its partner. Current will integrate with DPS\u2019 newest all digital processing solution called DPS Forward, which combines issuer processing capabilities with a new suite of APIs that integrate with modern digital banking players to create unique card programs and payment solutions. Finally, Visa Consulting and Analytics. Our advisory teams have delivered nearly 1,000 projects year-to-date in 88 countries to help our clients to be more successful. Let me just share a couple of examples. In Latin America, we developed a digital acquisition platform and help one of the top issuers in the region improved credit approval turn around times from days to minutes will also better qualifying leads to reach a 4 times improvement and approval rate compared to their prior solution. Globally, we have launched a new program called Visa Portfolio Health Check, where we review client's portfolios, tracking 30-plus key performance indicators. Year-to-date, we have held health checks across 55 countries, identify nearly 300 specific opportunities worth nearly $50 billion in incremental payment volume. Before I close, let me touch briefly on the two recently announced acquisitions. First, out of the open banking platform, Tink. Visa's proven infrastructure and sustained investment in resilient cyber security and fraud prevention, combined with Tink's API, their technology and customer relationships is expected to help accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe by ensuring a secure, reliable platform for innovation, which will help consumers and businesses. Second is the acquisition of Currencycloud, a global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide their customer and business customers innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments around the world.  As part of our network of networks strategy, the combination of currencies - Currencycloud\u2019s capabilities on the front end of the transaction through their API and our settlement capabilities across VisaNet and other Visa networks such as Plus, Earthport and Visa B2B Connect will be very compelling value propositions for our partners. In closing, as we look to finish our fiscal year, I'm very encouraged by the recovery trajectory across the board and pleased with the momentum in many of our key growth areas. Our recently launched new brand campaign describes Visa as the network working for everyone and we are increasingly sitting at the center of enabling money movement. I'm confident that our strategy combined with \u2013 our network-to-network strategy combined with our three growth levers of consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services remains more relevant than ever and positions us well as we look forward to our robust recovery. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant. Vasant?\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you. Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results exceeded our expectations with net revenues up 27%, driven by robust growth in both credit and debit in the U.S., higher cross-border volumes from a faster-than-anticipated recovery in travel, as well as a spike in cryptocurrency purchases and low client incentives largely due to deal timing. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, net revenue growth would have been 39%.  The reason for this large difference in growth is a result of the significant quarter-over-quarter change in growth rates of payments volumes, both last year and this year. The third quarter last year experienced the steepest drop in payments volume. And third quarter this year has been our strongest growth quarter since the pandemic started. When adjusted for the service fee recognition lag, net revenues for Q3 FY '20 are lower and net revenues for Q3 this year are higher. GAAP EPS grew 10%, primarily due to a non-recurring, non-cash step-up in deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently announced increase in UK tax rates starting in 2023. Non-GAAP EPS rose 41% helped by lower-than-expected expense growth and a lower tax rate.  Exchange rate shift lifted net revenue growth by 1 point and EPS growth by 2 points. As we did last quarter, to help you better assess both the magnitude and the trajectory of the recovery, we have also provided key performance metrics relative to fiscal year '19. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 34%, led by continued strength in debit, as well as improved credit spending. Compared to the third quarter of 2019 global payments volume was 21% higher, a 5-point acceleration from the second quarter, with debit and credit improving by 5 points and 4 points, respectively. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 38% or 25% higher than 2019 and the 5-point acceleration from the second quarter. Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded cost conversions, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was 40% and up 30% over 2019 benefiting from economic impact payments in the first half of the quarter, and then from the lifting of COVID related restrictions across the country. Debit growth accelerated 4 points up 48% from 2019, remaining strong throughout the quarter as the trend towards accelerated cash digitalization and e-commerce was sustained, even as the economy reopened.  Credit draught improved 8 points up 14 points from 2019, the credit improvement of fuelled by two interrelated factors, a significant acceleration in travel, entertainment, and restaurants spending, as well as the resurgence of affluent cardholder spending. Card presents spend accelerated by 9 points to 12% above 2019, even as card-not-present volume, excluding travel improved four points to 59% over '19 Online shopping habits acquired during the pandemic are persisting. As the U.S. reopened, travel and entertainment spending improved steadily through the quarter, both up about 25 points from the second quarter.  Travel is approaching 2019 levels in July, while entertainment surpassed 2019 levels in May. Restaurant spending in the quarter was over 20% above 2019 levels. Growth across all other expense categories remained strong and stable. International constant dollar payments volume growth improved four points from the second quarter up 13% over 2019 levels. A few regional highlights. Growth in our CEMEA region remains strong, up 48% from 2019 levels consistent with Q2 fueled by cash digitization and client wins.  Latin America was also up 48% from 2019, accelerating 8 points from the second quarter with robust performance across the region fueled by market share gains. Brazil volumes are seemingly unaffected by the high level of COVID cases due to significant cash due [Indiscernible] and large increases in eCommerce adoption. We are also benefiting from our digital partnerships and client [Indiscernible] in Brazil. Europe was up 17% from 2019, improving 9 points from the second quarter, the largest sequential acceleration among our regions. Across Europe, restrictions were relaxed and in-store spending recovered while e-commerce spend remained strong.  Asia-Pacific remains our weakest region, up 5% from 2019, and down three points from the second quarter, excluding China. Performance across the region varied based on the level of infections and COVID-related restrictions. There were intermittent restrictions during the quarter in Australia, Japan, and Singapore. Much of Southeast Asia was significantly impacted by rising COVID infections and result in lockdowns. In India, a sharp slowdown in spending starting in mid-April and to May was followed by a quick rebound with July trending well about 2019 levels.  Global profits transaction growth was 20% over 2019, improving 4 points from the second quarter as transactions increase with volume across every region, except the U.S., where transaction growth still large payments volume growth due to higher ticket sizes. Visa Direct transaction growth remained robust in the mid 50s. The profit model volume recovery continued as more countries open their borders. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was at 82% of 2019 volume, a 7-point improvement from Q2, led by a steady increase in travel, as well as the spike in cross-border cryptocurrency purchases from mid April through the end of May.  Cross-border Card Not Present volume excluding travel, continued to be very strong, up 56% from 2019, improving 12 points from the second quarter, with cryptocurrency purchases representing most of that acceleration. We have seen more active guard and more spend for guard in cryptocurrencies, currency purchases. We saw the normal seasonal uptick in cross-border travel spending during March and April. However, cross-border travel in May and June was stronger than the typical seasonal trend as many [Indiscernible] reopened or ease requirements.  Cross-border travel related spend, excluding Intra-Europe was at 45% of 2019 levels. Expanding 6 points in the second quarter, rising from 40% of 2019 April to 50% in June. The state of the cross-border travel recovery vary significantly across regions depending on border openings, quarantine, and other requirements, as well as, infection levels. Outbound travel from the U.S. and Latin America was back to around 60% of 2019 levels in the third quarter. But as Europe and CEMEA, were about half way back. Inbound travel has recovered the most into Latin America and CEMEA, with Latin America, above 2019 levels due to Mexico. but as the U.S. and Europe are only about a third of 2019 levels.  Asia-Pacific cross-border travel, both in and out, has recovered the least, still at around a quarter of 2019 levels. We've seen immediate impacts and popular travel destinations open their borders. Greece opened borders in April and inbound [Indiscernible] spend rose nearly 30 points by the end of June relative to 2019 levels. France opened on June 9th and [Indiscernible] volumes rose nearly 20 points by the end of June relative to 2019. Travel to Mexico has been strong for several quarters, where the third quarter accelerated further, helped by travels from the U.S. amid vaccination progress.  Since April, [Indiscernible] present cross-border spend in Mexico from the U.S. rose nearly 50 points to over 170% of 2019 levels. Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 17% led by 11% growth in the second quarter, constant dollar payments volume helped further by favorable exchange rates and mix, as well as small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 32% due to very strong domestic process transaction growth, particularly outside the U.S. The 7% point difference between revenue and process transaction growth reflected the mix shift away from higher yielding cross-border transactions.  In addition, while value-added services recorded in Data Processing revenues had strong and accelerating growth, This was slower than overall process transaction growth, which benefited from lapping effects. International transaction revenues were up 54%, 8 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding Intra-Europe due to lapping high currency volatility last year, and a less favorable regional mix. Other revenues grew 31% led by consulting and data services, and helped by lapping cover impacts last year. In total, value-added services revenue grew 28%. Of the 14-point acceleration from the second quarter, about two-thirds was due to COVID-related lapping effects.  Client incentive is about 25.8% of gross revenues, consistent with the second quarter but lower than our expectations due to both numerator and denominator effects. A lower-than-expected numerator at some deals with delayed and are now expected for the fourth quarter. Also, higher incentives from U.S. outperformance, the largely offset by lower incentives from underperformance in Asia-Pacific. A higher-than-expected denominator, as we had stronger cross-border volumes and value-added services revenue, both of which don't have significant incentives associated with them.  Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 12% below our expectations, mostly due to timing of some initiatives being pushed into Q4, particularly marketing spend and professional fees. Marketing expenses did grow over 50% in the quarter as we lapped with reductions in spending at the outbreak of will that last? Steel G&A expenses decreased year-over-year due to favorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower indirect taxes. The recorded gains from our equity investments of 439 million. Visa has minority investments in over 50 strategic partners.  When there is a new financing round or an IPO, per the accounting rules, we mark our investments to market which can result in gains or losses. Our investment portfolio has been performing very well. That will gains across several of our investments. The gain recorded this quarter was largely driven by one partner's financing round and another partner's IPO, excluding investment gains, non-GAAP, non-operating expense, was a 114 million in the fiscal third quarter. Our GAAP tax rate was 41.3% due to a billion-dollar, non-recurring, non-cash tax charge pertaining to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and the taxes related to investment gains.  The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected at 17.9% due to the recognition of a tax benefit. GAAP EPS was a $1.18, non-GAAP EPS was a $1.49 up 21% over last year. We bought 9.5 million shares of Class A common stock, at an average price of $227.83 for 2.2 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. we returned approximately 2.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Moving on to our outlook for the fourth quarter. I'll start with business trends through July 21st. U.S. payments volume growth was 31% about 2019, consistent with the third quarter, with debit up 46% and credit up 17% versus 2019. As you said before, weekly numbers can have noise in them.  For example, in the third week of 07/2019, a major online retailer had debt annual sales event which impacted performance index to 2019, particularly e-commerce spending using credit. International payments volume trends versus 2019 are moderately above the third quarter, but in line with June. Notable exceptions include improvements in India, Canada, and Brazil, with modest slowdowns in Australia and Japan. Process transaction growth continued to improve up 23% versus 2019.  Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis, were 81% of 2019, which is 1 point below the third quarter in June. Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 3 points compared to June, offset by lower e-commerce growth, mostly due to cryptocurrency purchases falling back to pre April levels. The recent announcements by the UK and Canada regarding border openings in August should be helpful in the fourth quarter, while Asia-Pacific remained largely close to travelers.  As [Indiscernible] July trends continue fourth quarter and net revenue growth is expected to be in line with the third quarter. We expect a benefit from the service fee recognition lag and the cross-border travel recoveries to be partially offset by cryptocurrency purchases falling back to pre-April levels, as well smaller year-over-year lapping benefits in transactions processing and value-added services revenues. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenue to increase 0.5 to 1 versus the third quarter due to delayed from the third quarter.  And the typical increase we see in Q4 due to the end of fiscal year deal closings. The third quarter was the first quarter of growth relative to Fiscal year '19, we have had since the pandemic started. Based on current trends, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth relative to Fiscal year '19 to be in the same range as the third quarter. Q4 operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-teens, inclusive of some expenses, land for the third quarter, which will push into Q4. Non-operating expense is expected to be around $125 million. Our tax rate expectations are in the 19% to 19.5% range.  In summary, we had a stronger - than -expected third quarter as economies and borders reopened. Even as card spend recovers e-commerce spend stayed strong. Debit spending sustained high growth rates as cash digitalization remains robust. The cross-border travel recovery is gaining momentum. Our new flows and value-added service businesses continued to grow at high rates as they have all through the pandemic.  We're stepping up investments in key growth initiatives as we look ahead to several quarters of recovery and prepare to capture the exciting opportunities available to us in the fourth quarter over the year. With that, I'll hand it over to Mike for questions and answers.\nMike Milotich: We're now ready to take questions, Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question coming from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thank you very much. Great results here. A lot I could ask, but let me ask on debit versus credit dynamics. I'm really focused on the U.S. here. I'm just curious about some of your views on relative growth between debit and credit change based on what you've observed so far in the recovery and with all these fintech things and investing in card growth and card engagement, I think, you mentioned Current and some others. So just curious what your thinking is there on structural growth between?\nVasant Prabhu: I think what we're seeing now is, as you've seen on the numbers, debit has had a indexing close to 150 pre-COVID levels, that reflects really a huge step-up in the digitalization of cash. It's evident all over the world. You see that in CEMEA numbers, you see it in Latin America numbers. So debit is the engine of cash digitization. So structurally, debit is benefiting from cash digitization picking up, as well as the move to e-commerce. What you are seeing though, is that credit is accelerating quite fast. And if you look at the numbers, the biggest quarter-over-quarter recovery has been quite significant in credit. Structurally, I think what we're seeing is the affluent customer come back to spending because economies have reopened and the plastic sectors that would benefit from reopening like restaurants, travel, and entertainment are also picking up. There's so many things going on here that are -- let's call it recovery-related or fundamental changes, like cash digitilization and e-commerce, that it's too early to tell whether there is a significant structural change between the use of debit and credit. I think credit has got quite a few quarters to go of recovery and the trend remains quite robust even as we look at July.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you. I appreciate that.\nAlfred Kelly: The only thing I would add, Tien-Tsin, is that, we saw major separation through the pandemic, part of the pandemic between credit and debit growth. And this quarter, the separation between them in the business was more like 6 points, where we've seen quarters closer to 30 points.. So that's further indication of credit starting to rebound for the reasons that Vasant articulated.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. You may go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Al, Vasant, can you talk about open banking and what it means for Visa in light of the accelerated activity there and also your recent acquisition of Tink? In what way Visa can participate in this global move towards open banking? And also, can you talk about the potential to take Tink\u2019s capabilities beyond Europe into other goes? Thanks.\nAlfred Kelly: Well, I'll star and Vasant can jump in. The epicenter of open banking is Europe, which is what attracted us to Tink. It is a open banking platform that has footprint in 18 markets that allows through single API customers, which are primarily developers to access financial data and Tink has connectivity to about 3,400 banks and FIs and about 10,000 developers in Europe. And it's one of 400 players versus other markets. There's an awful lot of players in the open banking space in Europe because of the fact that it is in ground \u2013 it is ground zero.  And we do think that the combination of our various capabilities and relationships combined with Tink 's technology and relationships is going to ideally accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe. It's early days, but there is going to be an increased adoption of open banking and we see making progress in Europe first even beyond the 18 markets that Tink is in. And there's no reason why we can't take the business to other parts of the world, particularly in Asia and CEMEA.\nHarshita Rawat: Thank you very much.\nMike Milotich: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. You may go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Could you update us on B2B Connect and talk a little bit how your go-to-market strategy there is evolving? How is it ramping? And just give us a general update on what's happening with B2B Connect?\nAlfred Kelly: Well, I think as we've talked in the past, that the most important thing with B2B Connect is to continue to grow out the infrastructure and that requires both signing key partners and we had announced last quarter, I guess, the signing of Goldman Sachs' Transaction Banking as a user of B2B Connect. And we're using bank integrators like ACI and Fiserv and Bottomline to help us as well in terms of driving more players in B2B Connect. At this point, that's our emphasis.  Our emphasis is building out this, the robustness of this network, so it has more endpoints and more clients. Again, we see this as a $10 billion opportunity. And we think that B2B Connect is - has the capability to be a much better than a Swift kind of alternative for driving payments without having to build - cross-border payments, without having to build out a corresponding banking network.  So we've continued to sign players and they've continued to do their infrastructure connections to us and we've started to drive transactions. But at this point what I have an update on B2B Connect, I'm much more interested in how we're doing in driving the robustness of the network versus being at a point where we're counting progress on the number of transactions that we're actually seeing flow over the network.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah, one other thing I might add to that is, you may have seen the announcement of Visa Payout Service. Essentially, we are integrating both Visa Direct and B2B Connect to offer a single-point for our customers to come to us for all kinds of cross-border payments, either business customers, B2B customers, whether they are low-ticket, high-volume, which we can handle through the Visa Direct capability and Earthport, or if their high-value, low-volume transactions which we can handle through B2B Connect.  So, essentially, from a client standpoint, they don't -- they just interface with us. And whatever their needs are, we can meet them in any form, whether it's to account to card or to any part of the world. So it's important to note that it's also sort of integrates well with our other capabilities to provide a single point of contact.\nRamsey El-Assal: That's terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig in a little on value-added services and new flows given the call out that value-added services grew 28%, I think, you said in the quarter. With peeking back at Investor Day, February 2020, which is of course, a lifetime ago now, but at the time, you would kind of put this framework out that new flows and value-added services were around 23% of revenues growing in the high teens and that was sort of a momentum expected going forward.  Can you just broadly talk about now 18 months later through the pandemic, how your outlook for new flows and value-added services has evolved? Do you now expect it to be faster and bigger, given both the secular shifts during the pandemic, as well as some of the acquisitions you've made, maybe what's just changed in that outlook? Thank you.\nAlfred Kelly: Well, Lisa, we remain extremely robust and excited about the opportunities in value-added services and new flows. Obviously, some of our value-added services, we actually saw our declines during the pandemic. Certainly, people were buying less travel benefits from us. There were less transactions in certain cases against which we could sell value-added services. But as I said, we started to see transactions really roll back this quarter.  For the first time ever, we averaged over 600 million transactions in the quarter -- and for every day in the quarter, I should say. And that was up 160 from -- by more than 160 million transactions a day a year ago during the pandemic. So I think that, as we start to get into what I believe is going to be a robust recovery and a continued growth in transactions.  We're going to continue to see our platform-type services, CyberSource, our issuer processing, our risk and identity services, which represent about two-thirds of our value-added services, grow very nicely. I think we've continued to start to see recoveries on the other side and things like our consulting. And I think as travel comes back, our card benefits and travel-related card benefits will increase.  So I think that while we rent during the height of the pandemic, we got off our trajectory of where we want it to be in 5 years. I feel like we're going to get right back on that trajectory and maybe even do better than we might have thought we would do. In terms of new flows, I'd say a couple of things. One is obviously Visa Direct continues to do very well. I cited that it was almost 0.5 billion more transactions in the quarter than the prior year. And I think in Vasant's remarks, he talked about mid-50s percent growth levels continuing and we've seen this for numbers of quarters now. And in the B2B space, we're starting to see some recovery.  The B2B space looks like the consumer credit space, so it's the commercial volumes kind of echoing or following that, mirroring that, although small businesses obviously recovering quicker than large market. But as I think, as people start to come back to work, as business travel starts to return, as I feel good that the commercial volume will continue to come back as well. So again, I would say that in the new flows area, while we, again, went off trajectory for what we would have said at Investor Day, the reality is I think we'll get right back on now as we're seeing a really very good beginning to what I think will be a robust recovery.\nLisa Ellis: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. You may go ahead, sir.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. I guess my question is, if you parse through the granular spending trends, I'm curious how much of the spend outperformance you're seeing is related to pent-up demand versus stimulus benefits. I'm just trying to think through how to run rate the outperformance. And then, specific to the fourth quarter expectations, maybe you could just speak, Vasant, your expectations relative to the third quarter, particularly on cross-border. Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. So as it relates to your the second part of your question, if you look at the trends in the first three weeks of July and I want to emphasize as you said before that three weeks don't make a trend and you shouldn't read too much into it.  I told you that the third week of July in the U.S. was impacted by what happened in the third week of July in 2019 because that's sort of, we often look at it as a clean year, but when you look at week-by-week numbers is always going to be unusual things about what happened in the same week in 2019, or what day of the week was when -- or what holidays impact [Indiscernible], and so on. So setting that aside, what you saw in the first 3 weeks of July was quite a bit of stability on the cross-border side. And we think that's sort of the trend for the fourth quarter.  We see some of the cryptocurrency cross-border purchases have fallen back to pre-recall levels. We had a spike in April and May, as we mentioned. So that will -- has pulled back in July, as you can see. That was replaced by travel continuing to recover. And so that gives you a certain amount of stability. The big question mark is, what kind of a summer travel improvement will we get in cross-border travel, given that wider borders have opened and substantially more borders are opened than they were before.  It's still not normal in that all borders are not opened and especially borders in Asia are not open. So I think our best sort of view of the fourth quarter as it relates to cross-border travel and cross-border in general. Is that cross-border in general stays relatively stable with the third quarter, with travel recovering and cryptocurrency purchases falling back a bit and so on balance we're at neutral. In terms of the domestic businesses around the world, we provided you some color in the comments.  Everything we're seeing so far, if you adjust for unique things that's happened in 2019 is a trend that's either stable or slightly better in the U.S. and around the world, either stable or slightly better, with no evidence right now anywhere of Delta impact in the spending. And an important correlation there is mobility. Mobility is highly correlated with spendingly fine. And mobility -- in mobility indexes in general are either stable or climbing still, even as infections are finding in many parts of the world. And even where infections have gone up a lot, mobility doesn't seem to be impacted yet. No evidence of it, nor are we seeing any impact on spending.\nAlfred Kelly: The only thing I would add is that the action where there's been stimulus that is certainly impacted some spending, but it tends to drive spending for a couple of weeks and then wain over the third to fifth week. I might use a different phrase than pent-up demand. I think it's a little bit of a return to normal. And I'd also bring back -- we're starting -- gyms are open, people are going to sporting events. A nd then I'd come back to something besides cited in response to one of the earlier questions, which is the affluent customers jumped back into the Marketplace. These are the people that drive up white tablecloth restaurant spending, if the people make discretionary purchases. These are the people who are heading to Mexico and other places as borders open up. And so I think again, I echo what Vasant said that mobility can continue to improve. I think we just get closer and closer to returning to a more normal and therefore feel like there's going to be good run here of a good recovery for the business.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research, you may go ahead, sir.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. When we look at cross-border at 85% of 2019 travel is still 50% to 60% of ' 19 levels. Clearly there's considerable room to the upside when that travel resumed, especially looking at how e-com's held up. So we just revisit the incremental net revenue opportunity from that? I know there's a lower correlation on rebates incentives from cross-border, and it's a higher margin business. So a, if you could just reconfirm that, and then would you let much of that pass-through per shareholders, just given that we've missed out on a year-and-a-half of cross-border into the same magnitude we should have had?\nAlfred Kelly: Well, if you do simple math and say that the cross-border business would have continued to grow at roughly 10% a year as it was growing pre-pandemic. And we're indexing right now, as you said, around 82% than '19. I mean, you can do the math yourself, right? We would've been indexing closer to 120 or 121, I suppose, if you assume 10%. and that delta between 82 and 121 gives you a sense if you apply that to our international revenues line, it gives you a sense of it. Now, we do have some additional cross-border revenues in the Data Processing line because that is -- the data processing revenue associated with cross-border too. But if you do the math, I mean, you can see that it's a sizable amount of revenue. Yes, you're right.\nVasant Prabhu: Incentives are not generally tied to cross-border. There are in some parts of the world, particularly Asia, where for travel-related portfolios, we may have some incentives tied to cross-border in those portfolios. So a fair chunk of it would flow through to the net revenue line. And that's largely a reason, in fact, why our incentives as a percent of gross revenues have climbed. It's because of this mix shift.  As far as how that how much of that flows through into the bottom line, our approach has been -- we need to invest as much as we need to invest to grow the business. There are significant opportunities available. We've already told you about how the expenses will grow in the mid-teens in the fourth quarter. If cross-border recovers faster, that won't necessarily change our investment plans. And we've never managed for margins. Margins are in outcome. Our goal is to drive as much more human revenue growth as we can and to invest what we need to drive that growth.\nDarrin Peller: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. You may go ahead, sir.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. And good afternoon. Question just following up on the Currencycloud acquisition and the growth of cross-border Visa's view on the growth of cross-border, maybe?Ex physical? travel. With all the different marketplaces out in the world, it seems like there's been an acceleration potentially. So any -- just any thoughts on the growth of cross-border long term?Ex? travel and the -- how Visa in particular is looking to get more deeply, I guess, engaged?\nAlfredKelly: Well, I'll start to emphasize to pick up. Look, the reality is the world is shrinking from the perspective of how easy it is for people to buy from sellers in different countries, in different regions around the world. And we've seen a dramatic increase millions of millions of people shopping online during the pandemic, who never shopped online before. So I our expectation is that you are going to continue to see very, very good growth in cross-border eCommerce going forward.  I think that the whole eCommerce trend, both domestically and in terms of cross-border, is something you're not going to be able to nor want to have go back to the way it was before. I think that this is a fundamental change in how people shop and it's going to continue to drive the cash digitization that we've been talking about.  Currencycloud, the acquisition we announced, I don't know, a week or two ago, I think builds on and extends our existing capabilities to provide better FX services and easier connectivity to FinTechs, financial institutions, and other partners. And they have a really cool set of APIs and And we think that combination of Currencycloud capabilities on the front end of a transaction via those API's. And our settlement capabilities across VisaNet and our other networks, B2B Connect, Northport pluses, cetera, is going to create a very powerful combination.  So, ultimately, our intention is to provide global?reach here? with simplicity and flexibility at competitive pricing. And we want to leverage our settlement scale and make sure that we're also leveraging our sophistication in managing risks. So we like -- we like the asset in Currencycloud, we like this to be combination of these capabilities and Currencycloud capabilities. And I -- we like the fact that from a dynamics perspective, we see cross-border travel continuing to come back over time, And we see the eCommerce cross-border continuing to be robust as we look forward.\nVasant Prabhu: And going back to your question about moving past our traditional business of enabling payments to merchants cross-border. You heard us talk about the extraordinary progress we're making in remittances for example. We signed up all the major Remington's providers and we can provide a very flexible, very attractive proposition for their consumers at a very attractive cost. And remittances is almost as big in volume as,?falling? direct investment. And it's not an area that we served before. Beyond that, you heard earlier about Visa payment service, payout service, which is very valuable to pay gig economy players around the world, as well as it has a big role to play in marketplace payouts and so on.  The third one I would highlight is the partnerships you signed with a whole range of cryptocurrency wallets that enable the use of Visa credentials that they issue at 70 million merchants around the world, and a big chunk of that business is expected to be cross-border too. So in our business in cross-border has gone well beyond the traditional, let's call it C2B space to P2P cross-border to B2B cross-border of course. And a significant chunk of D2C cross-border.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citibank. You may go ahead, sir.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, I'm Ashwin. I was hoping that you might be able to answer a framework question, as investors think primarily about Fiscal '22 rather than 4Q. As you're going through your budget planning process. How are you thinking about pricing? How are you thinking about expenses? What would it take for you to say, return to providing a full-year outlook? If you could kind of provide a framework of how you're thinking.\nVasant Prabhu: It's too early to give you a perspective on 2022. I think we'll save that for October. And where do we provide a full-year outlook or do what we've done this quarter is to give you the best sense we have of what, what we see around us right now and how it might play out for a quarter or two. Altogether, we go further than that, I think we'll look fast as we go along. As we've said, we've already given you some indications of our posture as it relates to investment. We are preparing for multiple quarters of recovery.  You'd -- perhaps, you've heard earlier about the conversation about the cross-border recovery that still remains ahead of us. So clearly, there's plenty of recovery still to come. And we are investing in preparation for the post - COVID world where we see extraordinary opportunities in new flows and value-added services. So we are stepping up investments, and our expenses are growing in the mid-teens and so on. But in terms of projecting where revenues are going to be or what the volume trends are going to be. We'll save a lot of that discussion and pricing and our thoughts for that for October.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good afternoon. Recently, your U.S. centric competitor sharply increased consumer rewards on one of its mass affluent credit cards and some of those reward increases were matched by Visa issuers. So I'm curious for your view on how this step-up in the rewards battle will impact credit card spending going forward, especially since many of these rewards are tied to travel and entertainment spend.\nAlfred Kelly: Well, I think what issuers are dealing is getting ready for our return to travel being a important spend category. As you well know, many of these reward propositions in North America, both in the U.S. and in Canada, are very tied to travel. All the big airlines, all the?booked big hotels? have co-brand programs and even for other programs that reward programs th at are more generic, a lot of their bird options are tied to travel.  So I think that travel's going to -- has started to come back, it will continue to come back as mobility increases, as restrictions get lifted, etcetera. And I think issuers are trying to make sure that as that happens and as the affluent consumer and the middle market consumer starts to get in their car and get on airplanes more, that their their product will be top of wallet and I think that's really what's driving the?activity?.\nMike Milotich: We've time for one more question, Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you. Dan Dolev from Mizuho, you may go ahead, sir.\nDan Dolev: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I was just surprised to see the impact of crypto on April trends like can you maybe help us quantify little more what drove the bump and how should we think about it in the future if we get into more crypto volatility, just to get some more color. Because I don't think this was a big factor in the prior quarters. Thank you so much.\nVasant Prabhu: we've seen a few months here and there of these kinds of spikes and purchases. So essentially, most of the time cryptocurrency impacts our business then purchases go up, a lot of the people who?microbe? go on buying them from entities that our non-U.S. based, often based in Europe. So these end up being cross-border transactions when they buy cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. And so when there is a spike in buying activity, you will see that in some of our cross-border e-commerce numbers. In terms of quantifying how much it is, if you look at the cross-border e-commerce business, ex-travel, has been quite stable through several weeks and months.  You will see a bump up in April and into May, and you can attribute a fair amount of that strictly to cryptocurrency purchases. We've had this before. There was another spike when there was a big run-up in crypto prices and then a collapse; I don't know, must have been a year ago. So it has happened before. It has now fallen back to pre-April levels, although it's still running at a level that is higher than it was 6 months ago. But you can quantify it if you look at the numbers.\nDan Dolev: Guys, thank you so much.\nMike Milotich: And that's all the time we have, so thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, you can always feel free and call or email Jennifer or myself. So thank you so much and have a good evening.\nOperator: And thank you.

I'm going to provide a few quick stats on the quarter and then share my thoughts on what's ahead as the world continues to recover. The recovery is going to take many different shapes and the timing will differ around the world based on vaccination rollouts and the easing of restrictions. But we believe we're at the beginning of the end of the pandemic. And the recovery is well underway, at least in a number of markets. First, Q2 results, revenue declined 2% year-over-year, but would be slightly positive at 20 basis points if service revenues were recognized on current quarter payments volume. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.38, a decrease of 1%. When looking at volumes and transactions growth, keep in mind that we're now lapping the start of the pandemic as growth rates are now less indicative of performance and the business trajectory. We're going to also provide some metrics compared to 2019 on a constant dollar basis. So payments volume grew 11%, improving seven points from Q1 and reached 116% of 2019, which is up three points from Q1. Cross-border volume excluding inter-Europe declined 21%, but improved 12 points from Q1 and it's 75% of 2019 levels, three points better than Q1. Process transactions growth of 8% improved four points from Q1 and represented 116% of 2019, which is consistent with the first quarter. This quarter, we continue to make progress across our three growth levers. First, consumer payments, in Asia-Pacific, we renewed our partnership with Rakuten Card, a subsidiary of Rakuten Group, the largest e-commerce marketplace in Japan. In Korea, Visa won the first hotel chain co-brand in the country with Marriott and Shinhan Card, Korea's largest issuer. In China, we renewed our credit portfolios with CITIC Bank and Agricultural Bank of China, two of the top 10 largest banks in the country. Also on the co-brand front in Brazil, Samsung in partnership with Banco Ita\u00fa, we will issue their inaugural co-brand in Latin America with Visa targeting Samsung's 57 million Brazilian users. In Europe, Visa won incremental business with BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium. This expands our relationship to include four million debit cards, in addition to our existing credit relationship. In Switzerland, we gained significant traction in growing Visa Debit. Since this January of 2019, we have signed 13 new debit deals, representing an incremental 2.6 million cards. In new flows, Visa Direct transactions grew almost 60% in the second quarter. We're pleased to have clients going live now with Visa Direct payouts which offers a flexible set of API for Visa partners globally to use a single point of connection for push payments to cards and accounts. MoneyGram, Goldman Sachs' Transaction Banking, Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong and KyckGlobal are among the first to start utilizing Visa Direct payouts for B2C, cross-border P2P and B2b payouts. A few additional highlights on specific Visa Direct use cases include that in the marketplace payouts, Airbnb, which now has four million hosts globally will offer host payouts using Visa Direct in select markets. In cross-border P2P, Remitly, a top digital remittance FinTech has renewed its Visa Direct relationship building upon the past two years of partnership. And Monobank in Ukraine enabled cross-border P2P to their 1.7 million cardholders. In the payroll category, the earned wage access use case continues to grow with 25 earn wage access platforms now offering Visa Direct for fast and convenient access to employee earnings. G2C continues to grow as well, Global Blue, a leading tax-free shopping solutions company covering 52 countries and 35 million tax-free transactions in 2019 is utilizing Visa Direct to distribute tax refund payments across Europe. Separate from Visa Direct, we supported the U.S. government's disbursements of economic impact payments to nearly 13 million Visa prepaid credentials in the U.S. so far this year. And add to our third growth, our value-added services were continuing to see strong adoption. Let me highlight a couple of examples. For CyberSource, Planet, our European acquirer and payment services provider that delivers payment processing and currency conversion solutions to over 600,000 merchants. We'll be partnering with CyberSource to simplify payments across the hospitality, food and beverage and retail sectors. KeyBanc, a top U.S. acquire will begin to offer CyberSource to its merchant clients. And as e-commerce continued to grow Decision Manager, a key risk offering of CyberSource increased transactions over 30% fiscal year-to-date. Our other risk fraud and authentication capabilities grew as well. For example, we've now crossed the two billion token milestone, up from 1.4 billion tokens just in September. One of our key authentication capabilities, CardinalCommerce grew revenue almost 50% year-over-year this quarter by rapidly expanding beyond the U.S. origins. In the next year, we plan to more than double our clients in Europe and Central Europe, Middle East and Africa. So while the pandemic has disrupted the world, it has not changed our strategy. In fact, it has reinforced our belief that our three areas of focus will deliver robust growth for years to come. As we look ahead with COVID recovery underway, a few key important realities, namely the way consumers feel about e-commerce, cash and travel will particularly impact Visa. The pandemic has accelerated e-commerce, global card-not-present credentials, excluding travel grew over 20% in the quarter versus last year. Our growth in card-not-present payment volume, excluding travel has averaged at least 30% in the United States, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, India, and Singapore over the last three quarters. And in global cross-border, excluding into Europe, it's averaged 20% growth. We believe this shift is likely to persist as the convenience of e-commerce is indisputable and its growth continues to be robust even as card-present begins to return. In March in the United States, as some states loosened transactions, card-present as a percentage of 2019 spend improved 11 points versus February. While at the same time card-not-present excluding travel, still expanded eight points. You look at that in Germany \u2013 in Japan, where restrictions were also lifted card-present improved six points and card-not-present excluding travel, still improved four points in that same comparison between March and February. The pandemic has accelerated the digitization of cash. And we see the impact and tap to pay. When we look at cash usage in the last 12 months, just on the Visa brand, such as with ATM withdrawals, we see that global debit cash volumes have decreased by 7%, while debit payments growth \u2013 payments side have grown 16% both on a constant dollar basis. This 20 point GAAP is more than doubled at historic GAAP in growth rates and relatively consistent globally demonstrating cash digitization in both mature and emerging regions. Overall, these tap to pay transactions have grown over 30% year-over-year in March. In Europe, less than a year since contact with limits increased across the region, Visa has seen $1 billion additional touch-free transactions. In the United States, one in 10 face-to-face Visa transactions are now done with a tap, more than a two times increase since the beginning of the pandemic. In New York city, the penetration is nearly 30%, demonstrating the potential of focused issuance and merchant enablement along the transit. In the past three years alone, we've enabled nearly 250 transit systems globally. And we can see based on our research that enabling tap to pay on transit can bring more than a 15% lift in transactions for merchants in the surrounding neighborhoods. The decline in travel is temporary, and we're starting to see some early signs of recovery. Cross-border travel-related spending excluding Intra-Europe, improved from Q1 driven by two factors. First, those who were abroad are spending more likely because of fewer restrictions. This quarter, essentially all the cross-border travel spend improvement was driven by higher spend per card rather than more active cause. Second, we continue to see strain from countries with open-border. For example, U.S. to Mexico volume was almost 20% above 2019 levels for the quarter. We also saw several top corridors between the U.S. and Latin America, improved by more than 10 points through the quarter versus 2019. Travel will certainly take more time to recover than other sectors, but we believe personal travel in particular will come back and that's good for Visa for two primary reasons. One, because the vast majority of the travel we capture on our credentials is consumer. And two, we are the global leader in travel co-brands. With the backdrop of travel, cash digitization and e-commerce, let's briefly explore the future potential of our three growth levers. In consumer payments, in the last two years, we've grown our credentials to $3.6 billion and physical merchant locations to over $70 million, up 7% and 34%, respectively. And remember that our merchant locations only count our partners like PayPal and Square each as one. That said, there's ample opportunity as we focus on specific region\u2019s requirements. Looking at regions, even with our leading position in both emerging and developed markets, our market-driven approach to growing credentials is succeeding, and Europe is an excellent example. From 2018 to 2020, we grew active card credentials by 10%. And looking ahead, we have line of sight to more than 25 million additional credentials across 50 clients in the next few years. Let me site a couple of recent partnerships that would show this rapid growth. Since fintech Revolut signed a global agreement in September 2019, selecting these as their lead issuing partner, they've increased the number of cards and payments volume by more than 200% through December 2020. Crypto.com has launched Visa cards in 39 markets across their 10 million user base since 2018. And just this quarter, they find a global growth agreement with us covering 12 markets with plans to expand to even more. There are so many more partners issuing credentials and building acceptance. For example, wallet providers represent the potential for another 2 billion credentials in 70 billion acceptance locations over time, and the pace of growth here is fast. YooMoney in Russia recently signed on to issue Visa credentials, and has achieved more than 1 million credentials in just five months. In fiscal Q2 last year, we announced that stc pay, Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest wireless operator with 25 million subscribers plan to embed credentials in their stc wallet \u2013 pay wallet. To-date, more than a 1 million Visa credentials have been issued. Our ongoing partnership with Paytm has enabled us to add more than 250,000 contactless enabled acceptance locations at new to card merchants, while the number of Visa credentials issued by Paytm has more than doubled since September of 2020 reaching a total of 3 million. Around the world, tap to phone has also been a significant acceptance effort. Today more than 35 markets offer it with 13 more being added this year. Wallets and tap to phone are just a couple of next-gen partners and capabilities that we believe will help us bring the $1.7 billion unbanked into the financial mainstream, growing the pie for digital payments. The growth will come from a regional approach and openness to partnering with traditional and new players and by developing new ways to engage the ecosystem all rooted in our strong brand and in technology. In new flows, our success in the United States is a real asset. While they have been impacted by the pandemic, our strategies against $120 trillion opportunity represent near, medium and longer term growth for Visa. In the near-term, we're focused on supporting businesses small and large. To-date, we've helped 12 million micro and small businesses to digitize and grow against our 50 million global goal. And we continue to focus on card-based solutions. Visa has about 20% more commercial issuers today than we did four years ago. In the medium-term, Visa B2B Connect addresses the major pain points with the current top solution in cross-border B2B. And we are continuing to add banks to reach scale. In the longer-term, we're working with key partners to solve the challenges in accounts payable and accounts receivable. For the other $65 trillion of new flows, Visa Direct has five clear competitive advantages that we believe will continue to drive growth. The first one is reach. In Visa Direct, the endpoints are card credentials and bank accounts, and we can reach $5 billion endpoints globally. This is unrivaled by anyone else. Second, operating scale; Visa Direct is built upon the operating scale of VisaNet and leverages its real-time authorization, clearing and settlement capabilities. This means we can deliver industry-leading solutions with low marginal cost. Third is commitment to network strategy. Visa Direct is truly multi-rail, which provides clients flexibility and efficiency. Just in the last year, it has utilized 16 card-based networks, 65 ACM schemes, seven RTP networks and five payment gateways. That is more connections, coverage and capability that we've seen from any other network offerings. Fourth, investments in our capabilities. We have invested in leading technology stack for both payouts and account funding capabilities. For example, our crowdfunding capabilities include unique codes to help clients manage risk, compliance and authorizations for money movement transactions with API to streamline implementation for apps, neobanks, and fintechs. To our knowledge, no one else has this capability. This is commercialization. We've now enabled over 20 use cases with more than 450 new program launches. And we will continue to expand by, one, growing existing use cases like marketplaces and cross-border P2P; two, bringing existing use cases like P2P payroll and earned wage access to other new markets; and three, developing new use cases such as tipping. Visa Direct also brings a network effect in terms of benefits to Visa. For every dollar received on a debit card through Visa Direct, about half of it is then used for debit card purchases. Furthermore card holders who receive payments through Visa Direct can spend up to 50% more than those who do not. So Visa Direct is actually not only helping new flows, but it is helping consumer payments. Lastly, let's turn to value added services, which are being utilized by our clients more and more. In fiscal year 2020, more than 60% of our clients use at least five value added services from Visa and more than 30% of our clients use 10 or more. Our toolbox is large with hands-on consulting, sophisticated and flexible technology platforms, valuable data and insight and card benefits, all which will improve with the recovery. We also have three platform businesses that scale, very profitably, CyberSource, issuer processing, and risk identity and authentication. With the recovery and the continued strength in e-commerce and debit these capabilities are well aligned with trends toward digitization. Let me just speak about CyberSource as an example, our strategy to partner with acquirers creates a leveraged opportunity for future growth, both transaction growth and cross selling value added services. We mentioned last year that Japanese acquire SMCC was going to start offering CyberSource capabilities to its merchant customers. Starting with one nationwide convenience store chain and rapidly expanding to over 30,000 merchants. SMCC is now delivering next generation acquiring solutions to Japanese merchants and CyberSource is processing over half a million e-commerce and in-person transactions per day. With all this opportunity across the three levers, we\u2019re investing heavily to drive future growth in several areas, including simple compelling user experiences examples include Tap to Pay, Tap to Phone and quick to that. Capabilities to scale new flows and value-added services examples include new needs and direct use cases and advancing fraud and identity solutions. Specific markets that can benefit from targeted resources, such as Europe and Africa. Innovations in payment \u2013 in the payments ecosystem such as crypto API for banks and digital currency settlement. To close, Visa has weathered the COVID storm, it is emerging from the pandemic even stronger. There\u2019s significant opportunity ahead and Visa\u2019s existing presence, scale and capabilities, position us well to capture more growth in the future. With that, now let me turn it over to Vasant for more colors on our financials and what we see ahead. Vasant, over to you.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter results were stronger than we expected with net revenue down 2% largely due to improving cross model volumes and lower than expected client incentives. GAAP EPS was flat to last year and non-GAAP EPS declined 1% helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shift increased net revenue by 0.5 point, but lower EPS by 0.5 point due to currency related benefits in the second quarter last year. As Al mentioned, as we lacked the most significant COVID-19 impact, starting in March, 2020, year-over-year growth rates are not the best indicator of the underlying trend. To help you better assess what the magnitude and the trajectory of the recovery so far, they also provided growth rates for key performance metrics relative to fiscal year 2019. In constant dollars, global payments volume year-over-year growth was over 11% fueled by continued strength in debit, as well as improving credit spending. Compared to the corresponding quarter in 2019, the other payments volume was 16% higher, but 3 point acceleration from the first quarter. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 13% or 20% higher than 2019 as Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was 18% and up 24% from 2019 benefiting from economic impact payments in early January and mid-March, as well as the relaxing of COVID-related restriction in many States partially offset by bad weather lowering spending in mid-February. Even after adjusting for economic impact payments, U.S. payments volumes have bounced back to the people that trend line. Debit growth accelerated 13 points to 34%, up 44% from 2019 boosted by the two economic impact payments in this quarter. Credit growth of 2% up 6% from 2019, the credit improvement of health by increases in retail, travel, restaurant and entertainment spending mostly starting in early March as restrictions were relaxed in many States. It is important to note that credit has improved without debits volume pointing to accelerated cash displacement. Card not present volume excluding travel continued to grow over 30% in the quarter and what 55% about 2019 levels primarily driven by retail spend. The most notable sign of a domestic recovery was card presence spent growing 4%, which is up 3% over 2019 and 8 point acceleration from the first quarter led by retail and restaurant spending. Improving card presence spending did not slow e-commerce indicating that e-commerce trend is likely to continue even as card presence spent recovers. International constant dollars payments volume growth was 6% up 9% from 2019 a few regional highlights. CEMEA remains our fastest growing region, growing 26%, up 50% from 2019 levels. The easing of COVID-related restrictions, particularly in the Middle East and Russia, as well as 0:25:52 drove the robust growth. Latin America grew 23%, up 40% from 2019, but consistently strong performance across the region mostly fueled by accelerating e-commerce adoption and usage as well as client wins. Europe grew 2% up 8% from 2019, but decelerated from the last quarter, as many countries put significant COVID restrictions in place, particularly the UK, France, Italy and Germany. In Asia-Pacific, excluding China, second quarter spending grew 4% up 8% from 2019. Performance across the region vary based on the level of COVID restrictions that markets like New Zealand and Singapore growing strongly by markets like Hong Kong and Japan, which had restrictions for most of the quarter the weaker. Global profits transaction growth was 8% up 16% from 2019 lagging volume growth due to higher ticket sizes, particularly in the U.S. and significant code restrictions in Europe. Visa direct continues to perform well. The transaction is growing almost 60% globally this quarter, consistent for the first quarter. The cross model volume recovery continued despite most models remaining completely or partially closed. Constant dollars cross model volume excluding transactions within Europe declined 21% in the second quarter, another 75% of 2019 volumes. Looking at the trajectory versus 2019, this was a feed point improvement from the first quarter. We\u2019re seeing the typical seasonal uptake in March and into April, which is a positive sign as we look ahead to the summer. Card not present excluding travel volume continued to be very strong growing 28% year-over-year, up 44% from 2019 driven mostly by retail spending and some benefit from cryptocurrency purchases. Cross model travel-related spend declined 55% year-over-year and more than 39% of 2019 levels. Card presence spend as a percentage of 2019 expanded 3 points versus the first quarter. Some color on the state of cross model travel as we approach the important summer travel season. Travel to and from the U.S. and Latin America is the best performing corridor almost at 90% of 2019 levels by March. Help by U.S. travel, travel into Latin America in general has recovered to over 80% of 2019. Travel between Russia and neighboring countries, as well as travel in and out of the Gulf States has helped CEMEA cross model travel to recover two-thirds of its pre-COVID volume. Cross model travel in and out of Asian countries remains very depressed down almost 75% versus 2019 and flat lining for the past six months. Travel into the U.S. an important corridor for us, but also down 70% versus 2019 in March, but hasn\u2019t been recovering slowly. The significant U.S., Canada border restriction travel is still down about 80% relative to 2019 in this corridor. As Europe has increased COVID restrictions, travel in and out of Europe remain hard hit down over 50% versus 2019 in March. Moving now to a quick review of second quarter financial results. Net revenue declined 2% as we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, net revenue growth would have been slightly positive. Service revenues grew 8% helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 11% with strong value-added services growth continuing to be partially offset by the mixed shift away from higher using cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 19% in line with nominal cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe. Other revenues were flat, negatively impacted by low usage of travel related card benefits and client marketing projects pushed to later in the year, while advisory services continued to grow strongly. In total, value added services revenue continue to perform well growing 14% with strong growth in CyberSource security and identity solutions. This quarter, we reclassified some prior period travel related card benefits as value-added services. And as such, our previously reported first quarter revenue growth would have been similar to the second quarter on a comparable basis. Prime incentives were 25.8% of gross revenues, lower than expected due to better than cross-border volume lifting gross revenue and lower Europe and Asia Pacific volumes benefiting client incentives. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 3% in line with expectations. Recorded gain from our equity investments of $156 million. Excluding investment gains non-GAAP non-operating expense was $109 million for the fiscal second quarter, below our expectations, primarily due to benefits, one of which is offset in personnel expenses and the other is related to the completion of certain tax audits. These completed audits also benefited our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate with a non-GAAP tax rate lower than expected at 16.8%. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS was $1.38. We bought 8.3 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $208.51 for $1.7 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share returned approximately $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Turning from the past to the future, I\u2019ll start with key business driver trends through April 21. As we look at these weekly trends, keep in mind, three key factors. One, year-over-year growth is napping the 2020 lows in many cases. Two, the timing of Easter is impactful. Three, in the U.S., there are peaks in debit spending when economic impact payments are deposited in people\u2019s bank accounts. Through April 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 64% with U.S. debit growing 67% and credit up 61%. Compared to 2019, U.S. payments volume, debit and credit were up 29%, 51% and 9% respectively, all consistent with the March trend. Looking outside the U.S., trends versus 2019 are relatively stable, notable exception is included the UK improving as restrictions relaxed, while India is slowing as restrictions increase. Profits transaction growth was 58% up 16% from 2019, which is consistent with the second quarter. Cross border volume excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis grew 63% and more than 78% of 2019, which is three points above the second quarter and one point above March. As we look ahead, there are several positive cross border travel indicators to highlight. Travel bubbles were being created. Australia, New Zealand is already in place with an immediate and substantial uptick in bookings. Hong Kong, Singapore is starting in late May with more likely. So far, all indications are that some popular tourist destination in Southern Europe will be open for the summer and bookings are trending well. Just this week, it was announced that Europe\u2019s border will be open to vaccinated visitors from the U.S. this summer. As a U.S. vaccination program moves along fast, it is possible that travel to and from the U.S. will gather momentum into the summer. Airlines are adding capacity in anticipation. The trajectory of the cross-border travel recovery remains a key metric to watch. We will be monitoring all leading indicators, using a border restriction for the bookings, as well as surveys of consumer intention and we\u2019ll update you as we learn more. As the previous quarters, accurate forecasting is difficult in this fast changing environment. Assuming stable to improving trends relative to FY2019 continue, Q3 net revenue growth is expected to be in the high teens. The cross border travel recovery trajectory will be the key factor to watch. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are expected to increase 1 to 1.5 points above the second quarter level as client volumes grow significantly over the last year low. And so this fees are recognized that the quarter lag. We plan to increase operating expenses in the mid-teens in the third quarter, as we step up investments on marketing and key initiatives to capture the significant growth opportunities Al described. We expect non-operating expense to be around $130 million consistent with the second quarter, excluding the non-recurring impacts I mentioned earlier. Our tax rate expectations are 19% to 19.5%, again, consistent with last quarter\u2019s expectations before the tax audit completions in the second quarter, I mentioned earlier. In closing, we\u2019re stepping up our investments to drive accelerated growth in a post COVID world. A few points to highlight. Our net revenue on profit by the fiscal year 2019 levels, even as the rebound in travel, especially cross-border travel still remains ahead of us after the world is vaccinated and borders reopen. That a significant pent up demand for travel in particular, personal travel. Large swaths of new consumers worldwide have been introduced to the ease, convenience and security that digital payments can offer. This is evidenced by the significant global growth in debit as consumers abandoned cash at an accelerated pace. These are habits we believe will not only stick, but also continue to grow help my initiatives such as staff to pay. Consumers, merchants and governments globally have recognized the value of e-commerce through the pandemic. Governments are upgrading the digital infrastructure, merchants are significantly enhancing their e-commerce capabilities and more consumers are turning to e-commerce across more categories and also cross-border. We expect these trends will only accelerate. But in our new flows business, Visa Direct has continued to grow an extraordinary rates. The pandemic has expanded adoption of use cases in P2P, B2C and G2C, many use cases and markets are just starting to scale. B2B remains a huge opportunity and they\u2019re committed to our three-pronged approach to drive growth, card based, cross-border and large enterprise accounts receivables and payables that many capabilities scaling or launching in the near future. Our value-added services have sustained high growth, despite lower usage of travel related services. That is an e-commerce acceleration have driven growth in our debit processing, security and identity and CyberSource businesses and the recovery in travel related services lies ahead. As a result, we see acceleration across all three vectors of growth in consumer payments, new flows and value added services. As Al indicated, we\u2019re investing in the strategies and capabilities required to capture these growth opportunities. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Mike for the Q&A session.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Vasant. Jordan, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks a lot for taking the question. I wanted to touch on the evolving mix of the cross-border business. So within cross-border, you call it out a couple of use cases for Visa Direct. Earlier you touched on remittances, you touched on marketplace payouts. But separately, we\u2019d add to that list some of the new flows within cross-border B2B. So maybe you could just comment a little bit on the prospects for those new areas of cross-border to come into the mix and maybe the more meaningful portion over the next, call it, three to five years.\nAl Kelly: Well, I think as we grow out our capabilities, if you see the recovery in the pandemic. I think that these have payouts capability we just put in place, which basically brings together what was earth for. And Visa Direct is a single point of connection is going to facilitate many more use cases and make it very, very easy for, for people to spend money cross-border. And that\u2019s kind of the high volume, lower value types of transactions. I think we are continuing to make progress in connecting more banks around the world to B2B Connect. And as we complete the grow out of that network over the next few years, I see us as having great capability to drive cross-border B2B high value, lower volume types of transactions. So I think the combination of our capabilities, what has happened in terms of continued adoption of digitization and the capabilities that we have built in and the use cases that we are working with today and anticipate adding to the mix over time. I think this is going to become an increasingly important and growing part of our business.\nVasant Prabhu: A couple of things to add, before we got into the pandemic two-thirds of our cross-border business was travel related, one-third was e-commerce related. Today, in the second quarter two-thirds of our business was cross-border e-commerce, one-third was travel. It says two things, one how much our cross-border e-commerce business has grown and the second, how much recovery is left in our cross-border travel business, because Al has said, most of our cross-border travel is personal travel and there's a substantial amount of personal travel that is going to come back once border is reopened. So the traditional, cross-border e-commerce is an area of significant growth we've seen that as people move online, they become somewhat less sensitive to where the product is shipped from. And there's just a lot more cross-border e-commerce. The other use case that pulls a lot of potential is to the extent that crypto related transactions become significant and they are enabling a vast number of them. One use case that is particularly useful in either stable coin or Bitcoin type of scenarios is cross-border. And that is another new use case that could have a lot of potential in the long-term.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks, Vasant. That's exactly what I was trying to get at, the mix has certainly flipped to more e-com and there are some new flows that are coming in to keep the travel portion lower than it was pre-COVID. So thank you so much for taking the question.\nVasant Prabhu: Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks guys and nice job. When we look at the Slide, the index to 2019 was really helpful, showing 16% up from 2019 levels. I mean, there's a lot of considerations we're getting at about including stimulus and higher savings rates, but clearly also structural changes in the industry, which \u2013 some of which we just touched on e-com, but just more going on to debit cards faster across the whole industry. How do you parse out what you see as structurally sustainable, e-commerce is a part that you mentioned, but even beyond that, just more on maybe small ticket versus what was maybe stimulus driven or near-term? Thanks guys.\nAl Kelly: But \u2013 I will start Darrin. First of all, I think we definitely see millions of new people coming into the e-com shoppers who weren't there before, and I don't think they're going to turn backward at all. So I think that certainly remains obviously as we get out of the pandemic, the stimulus types of money will dry up and that will go away. I think the people being concerned about cash and much more comfortable shopping online, the combination of that will continue. I think that will also see structurally much more Tap to Pay as people find that to be a more helpful way to shop. I think we're seeing governments during this pandemic become bigger clients and they're increasingly interested in showing the way in terms of digitizing more of what they do as a government and I think we'll see more of that activity taking as well. I think that, in general we had before the pandemic a very little separation in growth rate between debit and credit, in any given month or quarter, they would kind of grow within a percentage point of each other. We saw incredible separation during the pandemic as much as 40 points of differential incomes of growth. We're now seeing in this quarter credit come back a bit and then start to drift into a positive territory. But I think that at least for the foreseeable future and maybe for longer, that I think you're going to see debit continue to grow above credit, although as travel comes back that should certainly help bounce back credit buyers, particularly since most of the travel co-brand cards and many of the actual travelers tend to use credit cards.\nVasant Prabhu: I mean, a couple of other things to add there is, as you know, debit has become the engine for cash digitization. And what we see in this pandemic, especially as it has gone on for quite a while, is there's often a hurdle in getting people to change habits. So people are used to using cash, getting them to use digital forms of payment, not take some time. This pandemic has called a range of changes in behavior, because there was no choice, whether it's an emerging markets, where there was a greater propensity to use cash or certain cultures, you've heard of Germany and Japan as having been very cash based economies for a very long time or habits in terms of people using cash for certain categories like food and drug that's changing, more people using more cash at the physical point of sale, as Al said, with the cash dirty risk, as well as Tap to Pay are making payments easy at the physical point of sale, we're seeing a substantial shift towards cash digitization, even at the physical point of sale. And then the point you said about smaller and smaller transactions that used to be cash moving digital, again Tap to Pay is a big engine for that and the trajectory of Tap to Pay remains very significant. And we are probably within a year of coming to the point where the U.S. will be in takeoff with on Tap to Pay to which is a very big market.\nDarrin Peller: Really helpful guys, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much. Just bridging to Darrin\u2019s question on structural changes, when you look at the heightened shift to e-commerce, which you've indicated will likely accelerate even post-COVID. Can you talk about your funding mix of e-commerce transactions, debit versus credit, specifically how you expect that to evolve with economic reopening, would you expect consumers to lean a little bit more heavily on their credit cards as the economy rebounds or should debit likely remain the primary funding of e-commerce transactions?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, David, I think one of the incredible stories of the pandemic was that, debit has become the cash of the e-commerce world and people are doing much more everyday shopping post the pandemic than they did pre the pandemic. The amount of food orders that are placed and takeout orders that are placed, buying normal household staples that might have been, many of them were in person or the vast majority and maybe even some of them were in cash. But we're just seeing the type of transaction that typically goes along with debit is everyday spend. And so what we're seeing as a real structural change is, everyday spend is food from in-person to e-commerce in a big way. I do think though that credit will make a rebound particularly as some of the larger discretionary spending comes back in as the affluent get back into making travel reservations as the online travel agency business starts to grow. I think that there'll be a closing of the gap between debit growth and credit growth. But again, as I said to Darrin, I'm not sure that we get back to those two different card platforms growing at the same level going forward. I think we certainly closed the gap, but I think at least as far out as I'm looking right now, debit will continue to outpace the growth of credit.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks so much. You gave a lot of volume growth, a good detail here. I want to ask maybe differently about credential growth building on the last couple of answers here. It seems like everyone is trying to bank their users by giving them cards and there's a lot of new use cases around virtual cards, so I'm wondering either kind of is either out, if you're thinking about credential growth and you compare that to 2019 or are you thinking about potential for issuance or the pipeline for new cards that might be coming out globally? How does that measure it today? If you want to qualify that, is it much larger than what you would have expected, let's say pre-pandemic?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think the \u2013 first of all, good to hear from you. I think that the pandemic has interrupted a little bit, a real bolstering of credentials that was driven by a combination of marketplace platforms, wallets, Neobanks et cetera. I cited a number of examples in my remarks about the fact that we think that there's upwards of 2 billion more credentials out there from a lot of those types of players and we've seen, but I do it by building partnerships with numbers of Fintechs over the course of the last year or two, a tremendous amount of opportunity to grow these credentials. Either by having these players become issuers and acquirers for us, which is a very big and important trend particularly in developing countries, but also just getting currencies and credentials into some of the existing wallets. But we believe there's an enormous opportunity to grow the number of credentials. And it's something that we're certainly focused on particularly as we talked to the FinTechs, the Wallets, and then the Neobank around the world.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Appreciate that.\nAl Kelly: Thanks Tien-Tsin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hey guys. Great quarter. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit \u2013 you spoke a little bit about Bitcoin earlier and about the used case for Crypto and Bitcoin on cross border transactions. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 more about that and kind of the progress you're making on settlement and stable coins and the steps you've taken on a theory. I think there's a lot of interest out there and what you guys are doing there and how it's progressing? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Well, thanks, Dan. This is an interesting subject. So let me give a little bit of background to talk about where we see the opportunities. So first of all there's two market segments as we see it. No one is, are the Bitcoin to kind of, which are primarily assets held by people, they're not used much in a form of payments. We kind of think of them as the digital gold, and then there are digital currencies including central bank digital currencies and stable coins that are directly backed by existing fiat currencies, and they're definitely emerging as a payment option. And they're running on public blockchain, which is really an essence and additional network, much like an RTP or ACH might be. So our focus is on five different opportunities that we see in this space. And I would say that this is space that we are leaning into in a very, very big way and I think are extremely well positioned. The first opportunity is really at the core of what we do, which is enabling consumers to make a purchase of these currencies or Bitcoins, and we're working hard with Wallets and exchanges to just make sure we're facilitating acceptance of people's ability to use their Visa cards to buy. And besides referenced that in his remarks that we through our some increase, some of them by paying for people making these purchases on Visa card. Secondly, the second opportunity is enabling digital currency cash outs to fiat. So converting a digital currency to a fiat on a Visa credential, which then makes that those funds available for shopping at any one of the 70 million Visa merchants and gives immediate utility to the digital currency and we're the clear leader here. We've got over 35 digital currency platforms and wallets that have chosen to work with us. Coin based crypto.com, block five-fold BitPay are just some examples. And, so that's certainly the second big opportunity. Thirdly is enabling financial institutions and FinTech partners to be able to have a crypto option for their customers. So what we've done in this space is we created APIs that enable financial institution customers to purchase custody, or even trade digital currencies held by anchorage, which is the first federally charted digital asset bank in the U.S. and we've done our first rollout with first Boulevard, which is a digital Neobank focused on building generational wealth for the black community. So that's the third opportunity just helping FIS and FinTechs have this crypto option for their customers. Four point is settlement, which you started to reference, we've upgraded our infrastructure to allow a financial institution to settle with Visa in a digital currency with stable coin, starting with USDC. As you think, today we transact in 160 currencies every day, and we settle every evening in 25 currencies. So we're going to now be able to support digital currencies as an additional settlement currency on our network. And on our end, we're going to settling in USDC is pretty similar to settling in U.S. dollars, but the mechanics of receiving these funds is a bit different and requires just some integration work with several crypto custodian like players like anchorage. And then the fifth area of opportunities just working with central banks. Central bank digital currencies being explored in many nations and I think it could end up being proved to be quite valuable in countries where the infrastructure to distribute cash is either unavailable or limited. And it's one of the factors that hinders these 1.7 billion people I referred to on remarks that are outside the financial mainstream for being in the financial mainstream. So we're talking to central banks about the criticality though of public private partnership, and in particular the criticality of acceptance, because for these central bank digital currencies to have value they're going to have to both these secure in the minds of consumers and that's something we have a long track record with and can help. And then secondly, obviously they have to have some form of utility. So Dan, that's a bit about how we're thinking about crypto with our real focus on digital currencies and those five opportunities.\nDan Dolev: Thank you, Al. Yes, it definitely sounds like you guys are at the forefront of these. So recharge on that. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon guys. Al, I'll use your comment there that debit is becoming the cash of online transactions as an opening task about the online debit competitive environment. Can you just highlight or describe what in your view from Visa's perspective are the advantages of Visa signature debit products over alternatives like account-to-account transfers or pinless debit for online transactions? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Al, I think you're on mute.\nAl Kelly: Sorry, Vasant. I'd better tread a little bit lightly there in light of the DOJ case, so we feel very good about our Visa debit business. We think we've got very, very good capabilities and we believe that the innovations that we have the ability to stand behind customers in disputes and other cases makes our products something that both consumers, merchants and issuers look to true. And we will continue to invest in debit for a product that we hope people use both online and in purchases around the world.\nLisa Ellis: Perfect. Thank you. Thanks for covering.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks and good evening. I in keeping with the kind of structural change being that we all seem to be on tonight. All of these new products, I'm just wondering how the long-term growth rates of the company are going to be sustainable if not accelerating from these kind of levels. You're using these indexes back to 2019, but I'm thinking back even a couple of years, it's a much larger organization. You seem to outline many potential avenues of growth. So I'm wondering, are you at a point now where there is just this pivot in the actual business itself where it constructionally grow faster than they did over the next five to 10 years, then maybe you did over the prior five to 10 years, just given all of the new constituents that you're ultimately servicing these days?\nAl Kelly: Well, Dan, we don't typically get into forecasting out that far, but obviously you hopefully got a good sense in my remarks that we feel like we have three very strong growth drivers and we think each of them has tremendous gas left in the tank. We \u2013 and our consumer payments which has been our staple for years still has huge upside, you're back to Tien-Tsin\u2019s question about credentials growth. We think there is tremendous amount of growth in credentials, we think there is tremendous amount of growth in acceptance footprint. We think there is a tremendous amount of growth when we look at various geographies, and we look at the 1.7 billion people that are outside the financial mainstream. When we look at new flows there is $185 trillion of opportunity there. So we think we've got two big efforts going in both B2B and Visa directed to take advantage of those. And value-added services is relatively new as well, but we've got to \u2013 in terms of how we talk about it, we've had many value-added services or capabilities or solutions for years and they've always contributed well to our revenue, but we were increasingly been focused on them the last two years. And we\u2019re driving a lot more revenue and higher revenue growth than we had in consumer payments through value-added services. And so we think there is still a tremendous amount of upside there, I commented about the fact that we're getting high usage from a lot of our clients, but there is still a huge amount of room to grow with existing \u2013 with clients that are already using value-added services, as well as clients that are not assuming as many of their value-added services. So I look ahead and say the future is very, very bright and adding on top of that a lot of what we've talked about in terms of digitization and the fact that we will come out of this pandemic and we'll start to see travel recover all of those are extremely good trends for us.\nDan Perlin: Excellent. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. My question is on the growth in buy now, pay later. In a very long time horizon, how do you see the NPL coexisting with credit and debit? And I know it\u2019s globally very small right now, but the growth rates are very interesting. Given your partnerships with the NPL providers your installment relations, it\u2019s a growth here as it's growing opportunity from your perspective. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: I don't know where installments is going to end up, but we are attacking that, like we attack crypto and other things and assuming that it's going to be successful and that we want to lean in heavily and be in the middle of it and be a driver of what's going to potentially happen. As you alluded to, we have both strategy working with third-party providers as well as offering our own Visa proprietary platform that would allow issuers to offer their own buy now, pay later capability. And we see it as potentially having a very, very good effect for us. I mean, we could see \u2013 we could work with a whole bunch of options, virtual cards from Visa could be used for repayments, a Visa card on file could be used for repayment, we could explore Visa Direct as a way for installments to be paid off. And in many of those cases, if that's the case, what ends up happening is a single purchase turns into a number of installments. So that one transaction can end up being three to four or five payment transactions, which is certainly very, very good for us. We also think that this is a space where we can sell value-added services, data analytics broadband providers underwriting for example are risk products to help some of the third-party provider. So we\u2019re doing a lot in this space, we're committed to it, there are countries where it has taken off, there is other countries where it's nascent. Again, I can't predict exactly where it's going to land, but we are going to the degree that it takes off, we're going to be there to be part of it.\nHarshita Rawat: Great. Thanks, Al.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJamie Friedman: Al, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the trajectory and the spend per card, I was hoping you could elaborate on that. How you see that evolving, I would think with the recovery of travel, there would be more gas in the tank, there as well? But anything you have on spend per card, would appreciate it. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Well, in my remarks, what I believe I referenced was that in travel, we were seeing higher spend per card versus seeing more people active. And while we haven't been able to study that, what we think is happening is that with \u2013 in places that people can travel, there tend to be also just less restrictions. And that's just opening up more options for people to actually spend. And for instance instead of doing takeout, go to a restaurant and eat a more expensive meal or a nice bottle of wine and et cetera. So I think that right now, what we're seeing is simply higher spend per card in terms of travel. We haven't commented on spend per card beyond that.\nJamie Friedman: Got it. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: One last question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey guys. Thank you. I was just curious if you could share with us some of your underlying assumptions for the different gross revenue lines, if we look at the high teens revenue growth outlook for the June quarter, I know there is a lot of moving parts in the macroenvironment, it just seems like high teens could maybe be conservative based on what you've seen in April so far, even though I know the comps won't be as easy in May in June. So would just love to hear more about how you're thinking about the different pieces of gross revenue, because you outlined the rebate piece pretty clearly.\nVasant Prabhu: On revenues \u2013 high teens is our best estimate. Service revenues as you know were recognizing with a quarter lag. So the service revenues you've seen in the third quarter remember will not reflect the revenues related to the volumes in the third quarter. So the third quarter will have a big ramp in volumes as you're seeing, because we're lapping, but the revenues in service fees will reflect the revenues from the volumes in the second quarter, it's important to remind people of that. In terms of the cross border business, I think you see what the trends are. In terms of transactions, I think the trends are fairly stable at this point quarter-over-quarter. A point to make on incentives, it's important for you to note that last year third quarter was when our incentives were really hit because volumes declined, even though we recognized and received that allowed \u2013 our incentives are recognized in the quarter based on quarter volumes. So this quarter we'll see a big ramp in volumes relative to last year, which are going to cause incentives to go up a lot and be compared to a quarter last year where they went down. The second thing is, we have these incentives tied to certain thresholds being achieved last year because of all the drops, thresholds were not achieved, this year we're resuming the ability, so you get an additional amount of incentive, because clients are going to hit certain thresholds. So you have to factor in the fact that year-over-year incentives growth is going to be quite high in the third quarter and factor in the fact that we won't have the benefit of the volumes in our service fees because of the lag. So you should make sure you have all that as you think about our third quarter revenue growth.\nJamie Friedman: Right, okay. Well, thank you for all the color.\nAl Kelly: And with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. If you have additional questions, you can always reach out to myself or Jennifer and we're happy to help you. So thanks so much and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference, you may disconnect at this time."}, {"symbol": "V", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-01-28 22:34:03", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Visa's Fiscal First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the questions-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Milotich, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Michelle. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors.

For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. With that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Even with vaccine proliferation on the horizon, COVID-19 infections really continue to rise causing restrictions to be implemented in many parts of the world. Amidst the pandemic Visa delivered strong financial results in our fiscal first quarter, and our strategy to enable money movement globally remains clear. Pursuing growth through core consumer payments, new flows and value added services. On our call today, let me discuss our Q1 results and that provide detail on our momentum this quarter with clients and the valuable solutions they utilize to drive money movement globally. As a review of Q1 results, recall we're growing over a quarter where no one had ever heard of COVID-19. Payment volume process transactions and cross border volume all improved from Q4. Payments volume improved half a point, processing transaction growth improved a point and cross border volume improved 8 points. Net revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $5.7 billion a year-over-year decrease of 6%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.42 a decrease of 3%. Through our dividends and buybacks we returned $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in Q1. Vasant will cover spending in great detail, so I'll only make a few high level comments on holiday spending. U.S. holiday spending was quite different this year, but had a similar overall growth for the last three years of holiday seasons, led by strong retail growth somewhat offset by travel entertainment and fuel. This year in the U.S., we generally saw a continuation of the trends that have been occurring during COVID, strong debit and e-commerce and weaker credit and card present. Outside the United States, holiday retail spending growth broadly accelerated with growth in Canada, the UK, Brazil, and Australia, all rising by five or more points over last year. Now, let me transition to our progress with clients. We continue to win and renew business as we transfer money movement globally through consumer payments, new flows and value added services. In consumer payments, we continue to focus on digitizing $18 trillion spent in cash and check globally, by working with partners to grow endpoints and deepen customer engagement with innovation. We are growing credentials with traditional issuers FinTechs and wallets. Let me start with North America. We are very pleased to have renewed our long standing partnership with Wells Fargo across consumer debit, credit, small business and commercial for the next six years. The Bank of Montreal, Canada's fourth largest bank and the only top five Canadian bank, not previously issuing with Visa announced a new partnership with us to issue two affluent lifestyle credit card products in the Canadian market. These products are digital first targeting the affluent millennial segment and offer strong rewards and value to cardholders in a differentiated and innovative way. In our Asia-Pacific region, we won the debit business of Malaysia's AmBank after winning the credit business just a quarter ago. Our relationship with LINE Pay also deepen this quarter on two fronts. First in Japan LINE Pay is now issuing a Visa virtual prepaid card, and second Visa secured an exclusive partnership with LINE BK, Thailand's first social banking platform issuance of Visa Debit cards. Within the first month LINE BK issued 180,000 Visa Debit credentials. In Russia YooMoney [ph], one of the country's largest electronic payment services with more than 120,000 merchants worldwide and 40 million endpoints, signed on to issue Visa credentials in their wallet and enable Visa Direct. In Europe, we had several notable wins as we continue to increase our business on the continent. Visa secured a business agreement with Santander Group, becoming the preferred partner in credit and commercial for Santander Bank across seven countries in continental Europe. We also want the prepaid issuance of Moody, the first proximity banking and payments company in Italy, which offers its services through both digital and retail channels with over 45,000 points of sale in rural and urban areas that can reach 20 million customers. \u0130\u015fbank, the largest private bank in Turkey, with 20 million cards have selected Visa for its consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. Last we renewed two portfolios with a leading UK issuer, one for consumer credit, and one for commercial charge card. We also continue to deepen engagement with our partners to find new ways to remove friction and enhance the client experience through innovation. Just yesterday, we announced the global partnership with TransferWise and the first use case of Visa Cloud Connect a new way to securely connect to VisaNet through the cloud. The new platform will enable the expansion of TransferWise as multicurrency debit cards in Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, UK and the U.S. and deliver a range of Financial Services via mobile app to their customers, including currency exchange, and P2P payments, all linked to a Visa card. Pay continues to expand representing almost two thirds of all face to face transactions, excluding the United States. In the United States, we have approximately 300 million contactless cards in place now and have high single digit penetration of face to face transactions. Even at this level, the U.S. is now the fourth largest country in the number of tap to pay transactions. Enablement continues to grow as all 500 of Costco field locations and Chipotle and Nordstrom Stores now accept tap to pay. I'm also pleased to report that the New York City MTA has completed their rollout to all subways and buses. Processing is also a way to bring Visa's innovations to market and we have made significant progress in Latin America this past quarter in Ecuador, Colombia and Peru and now have reached 100% processing penetration in Chile. As I close out the consumer payments section, I wanted to note some progress in India. We continue to grow credentials. The Amazon Pay, ICICI bank cobranded credit card in India has set a country record by issuing over a million cards in just 20 months. On the acceptance front, India now has 6.5 million acceptance points including over 1 million QR points, up almost 20 percentage points from a year ago and 65% of all terminals are tap to pay enabled. The Reserve Bank of India recently raised the contactless limit which will soon cover 90% plus of all transactions in India. Visa has entered into new partnerships with leading acquires such as SBI payments to large acceptance solutions, such as tap the phone and contactless, and Visa is partnering with the largest acquire in India HDFC Bank, in the largest scale up of Smart Hub and absolution bundling payments banking and value added services to help small merchants grow their businesses. We're also contributing to India's Payment Infrastructure Development Fund to encourage growth of physical and digital acceptance in underpenetrated geographies by adding 1 million points of sale and 2 million QR points per year over the next three years. All of these efforts build on our leading credit and debit market share in India. Now on to the second level, last level of growth new flows, which represents 185 trillion in opportunity. We're pursuing this opportunity with our traditional commercial card solutions as well as newer capabilities like Visa Direct and Visa B2B CONNECT. While we're making progress across all new flows, I'll highlight a few advancements from this quarter. In B2C, gig economy payouts and earned wage access continue to grow meaningfully in the wake of COVID. This quarter with DoorDash, we launched the Dasher direct business prepaid card in the U.S., offering the over 1 million dashers on the DoorDash platform access to daily deposits of earned wages and rich card benefits. In Canada, Skip The Dishes, the country's largest food delivery network rolled out their visa direct enabled courier payouts called fast cash. P2P, which represents 20 trillion of the flows was Visa Direct first use case and continues to grow substantially. A key area of future growth is cross border P2P or remittance. Four of the top five global money transfer operators were on boarded in fiscal year '20 TransferWise, Western Union, Remitly and MoneyGram, which noted a 500% increase year-over-year in real time transfers in December alone. Our efforts to expand remittance also extends to FinTechs and banks who can enable this capability. ZPay a fast growing African FinTech will use Visa Direct to allow Africans to send money across European and North American corridors, and soon will expand to all major corridors globally. TransferGo, a global money transfer company that supports migrant workers to send money back to their relatives, without paying unnecessary bank fees has enabled Visa Direct in 55 markets that has the potential to expand to a total of 178 countries in the future, with its upcoming additions such as the UK, Italy and Nigeria. Across the globe, in the first quarter Visa Direct transactions grew almost 60%. Now onto B2B, the cross-border Goldman Sachs transaction banking recently signed on to employ Visa B2B Connect for cross-border B2B money movement, offering its corporate clients the ability to transact in over 80 markets globally. We are very pleased that our partnership with Goldman continues to deepen on multiple fronts. In the virtual card based business, we've expanded our relationship with UK based Conformer Pay to launch Visa commercial pay, which has three offerings, a mobile app, enabling virtual card issuance and management for business incidentals, two, a solution to manage business travel spend with enhanced data, and three, an integrated payables platform that can seamlessly send payments to suppliers. Barclays has already launched this functionality for their commercial clients. Currently, essentially, all of these new flows are transacted in traditional Fiat currencies. But there's a growing interest in digital currencies. And I wanted to take a minute to talk about how Visa thinks about crypto in general and our approach. In this space, we see ways that we can add differentiated value to the ecosystem, and we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help make crypto currencies more safe, useful and applicable for payments through our global presence, our partnership approach and our trusted brand. We think of the crypto market in two segments. First, there are crypto currencies that represent new assets, such as Bitcoin. Secondary, digital currencies or stable coins that are directly backed by existing Fiat currencies. We see all currencies in that first segment as digital gold. They are predominantly held as assets that are not used as a form of payment in a significant way at this point. Our strategy here is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials, or to cash out onto a Visa credential to make a Fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa is accepted globally. This is similar to our approach to connect close with wallets such as, LINE Pay and Paytm. For the second segment, Fiat backed digital currencies, including stable coins and central bank digital currencies, these are an emerging payments innovation that could have the potential to be used for global commerce, much like any other fiat currency. We think of digital currencies running on public block chains as additional networks, just like RTP or ACH networks. So we see them as part of our network of network strategy. Across both of these segments, we are the clear leader in this space. Today, 35 of the leading digital currency platforms and wallets have already chosen to issue Visa, including Coinbase, crypto.com, BlockFi, Ford and Bitpanda. These wallet relationships represent the potential for more than 50 million Visa credentials. The next leading network has a fraction of that. And it goes without saying to the extent a specific digital currency becomes a recognized means of exchange, there's no reason why we cannot add it to our network, which already supports over 160 currencies today. Let me now turn to our third growth lever, value added services. Here we saw revenue grow at 19% in Q1, and let me name a few services with notable progress this quarter. As e-commerce explodes, interest in CyberSource remains strong for merchants, as well as from FinTechs and acquirers looking to leverage our capabilities to offer to their clients. This quarter, two additional leading acquirers signed on to use CyberSource, K Bank in Thailand and NAB in Australia. As one of the largest debit and prepaid issuer processes we've been looking to expand Visa DPF globally, in that vein, we are pleased to share that we're bringing our Visa debit processing system to Europe. DKB, our largest issuing bank in Germany has chosen DPF as its debit processor and recently processed Visa's inaugural European DPF transaction via their platform. DKB will also be able to take advantage of nearly 20 value added services through this connection. We have believed for years that installments represent an important opportunity in payments. To enable this capability, we offer our own network solution for issuers, merchants and FinTechs installment providers to use directly or also work with many. And we also work with many installment providers to develop new solutions. This quarter we had updates on both fronts. We signed a global deal with Afterpay, extending our U.S. relationship to an additional seven countries, where Afterpay will use Visa technology to accelerate its global expansion. In addition, Visa and Afterpay will test and collaborate on the application of new technologies, like tokenization and Visa direct. We announced in July that Commerce Bank in the United States was piloting the network solution, and it is now launched with about 300,000 customers live. Visa also signed Scotiabank as the first Canadian bank to launch a post purchase installment pilot with employees in December, with a full market rollout slated for mid-2021. All of these growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value added services are driven by our network of network strategy, which is enabling all forms of payment, utilizing all networks and providing the value added services you would expect from Visa as we enable money movement. In closing, a few points, domestic volumes driven by debit and e-commerce are really holding up well, holiday spending will different in terms of categories and timing was quite good. Q1 overall was a very solid quarter and positive momentum continued, albeit we are still impacted by COVID-19. We are continuing to work very hard to balance expense management and recognition of the short term realities and investing in an exciting set of growth opportunities, as we always manage the business for the long-term. We continue to be focused on our three growth levers, all of which are supported by our network of network. And lastly, we are hopeful that as vaccines roll out and become more readily available, lockdowns, travel restrictions and capacity constraints will be lessened or eliminated, enabling travel, entertainment and other commerce to grow. With that over to Vasant, for more color on our volumes and our financials.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. During our fiscal first quarter last year, COVID-19 was not yet a word in the English language. This will be the last quarter where our performance is compared to a quarter of with no COVID impact whatsoever. As such, our results this quarter provide a clear picture of the state of the recovery. Overall, the quarter was stronger than we expected, but net revenue down 6%, largely due to the cross-border business. EPS declined only 3% helped by lower expenses and a lower tax rate. Exchange rates shifts with the last year, increased reported net revenue growth by less than half a point and EPS growth by less than one point. As we approach the first anniversary of the pandemic, where do we stand across our key business drivers, relative to where we might have been had the pandemic never happened? Global payments volume is 4 to 5 points short of where we might have been. Debit has outperformed helped by accelerated cash displacement and credit is still a drag. In the U.S., we are actually back to our pre-pandemic growth trajectory, with debit significantly ahead of setting credit under performance. As you know, where we are well behind is in our cross-border business. In the first quarter of fiscal '21 our cross border volumes were almost 40% lower, excluding Intra-Europe volumes than they might have been had the pandemic never happened, largely due to travel. Cross border travel volume, both card present and card not present is still down almost 70% relative to where it might have been at this point. Let's start with a review of the key business drivers in the fiscal first quarter. Global payments volume and transaction growth rates were modestly better than the prior quarter. The cross model volume recovery continued even as most borders remain completely or partially closed. The trajectory of the domestic spending recovery varies across the globe. Some regions and countries are recovering fast, others are holding steady, while some have slowed in recent weeks as a result of new restrictions. What remains consistent globally is very strong debit and e-commerce spending, which is partially offset by weaker credit and in store spending. Although, constant dollar cross border volume, excluding transactions within Europe is still down 33%, there was an 8 point improvement from last quarter. Payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew 4.5%, debit was up 17%, 3 percentage points lower than last quarter, while credit declined 6%, up 3 percentage points from Q4. Growth excluding China was 7%, up almost a point, as Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual branded card conversions, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was 8%, up half a point from last quarter. Debit growth remained strong at 21%, debit growth was 3 points lower than the fourth quarter, largely driven by a step down in unemployment benefits distributed via Visa prepaid cards. Credit spending declined 3% year-over-year, a 4 point improvement versus last quarter, driven by an acceleration in retail spending and some recovery in travel and restaurants spending. Card not present volume excluding travel continued to grow over 30% in the quarter, primarily driven by retail spending. The decline in card present spending was consistent with last quarter. However, performance did deteriorate through the quarter as rising COVID cases led to further government imposed restrictions in several states and cities. Card present spending slowdowns the most significant in the restaurant segment, as well as during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend across most segments. Across spend categories, growth was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. Categories which have been growing above their pre-COVID levels have remained elevated, including food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. For categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic including travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants spending remain depressed, with year-over-year declines consistent with last quarter. International payments volume grew 2% in Q1, while 6%, excluding China, both of which are up one point versus last quarter. A few regional highlights. EMEA remains our best performing region, growing 19% in constant dollars in the quarter, and more than 4 point improvement over Q4. The easing of COVID-related restrictions particularly in the Middle East, and clients win drove the robust growth. Latin America grew 16% in constant dollars, a nearly 10-point acceleration from last quarter. This growth acceleration is fueled by limited COVID-related restrictions in most countries, elevated e-commerce spending compared to other regions, and growing our market share with client wins in a few of the larger countries. Europe grew 5% in constant dollars, but 4 point slowdown versus last quarter. This deceleration was driven partially by renewed restrictions in the second half of the quarter due to rapidly rising COVID infection rates, particularly in the UK, France, Italy and Germany. And also, as you may remember, growth in Europe last quarter benefited from a non-recurring event in the UK related to purchases of higher interest bearing savings funds. Asia Pacific declined 8% in constant dollars, excluding China, Q1 spending was flat, a 4 point improvement since last quarter. There continue to be more COVID-related restrictions in effect across Asia than other parts of the world, however, several larger markets, such as New Zealand, Australia, Korea and Japan have returned to growth. Process transactions growth was 4%, up one point from last quarter. Growth accelerated faster than payments volume as transaction sizes continue to normalize ex Europe. Increased COVID-related restrictions in Europe are driving higher average ticket sizes, causing transactions growth to slow. Latin America is benefiting from processing wins in several countries, including Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Chile. Visa Direct continues to perform very well, the transaction is growing almost 60% globally this quarter. Growth remains strong in every region as we continue to launch new use cases, further penetrate existing use cases such as earned wage access and cross-border remittance, and expand existing use cases to new geographies. Constant dollar cross border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, declined 33% in Q1, an 8 point improvement from the last quarter. Travel related spend declined 64%, but improved 6 points versus the fourth quarter. Card not present non-travel growth was 20%, up 3 points fueled by strong retail spending in November and December. Constant dollar cross-border volume, including transactions within Europe, declined 21% in the quarter. Although cross-border travel performance improved steadily through the quarter, the travel improvement was concentrated in only a few markets, where borders are open. Travel from the U.S. to several countries in Latin America remains strong, including Mexico and the Caribbean. The UAE has been open to travelers attracting people from Europe, Russia and other Gulf countries. Also, travel across countries within the former Soviet Union has been growing. Unfortunately, the majority of borders remain closed or impose significant requirements on international travelers. The World Tourism Organization reported in December that out of 217 countries, 118 countries, or 54%, still have completely or partially closed their borders to foreign visitors, of the remaining 99 countries, the majority are mandating COVID tests with quarantines. Very few countries have no COVID restrictions. Significant obstacles in crossing borders remain the single most important factor, driving the slow recovery of cross-border travel. A quick review of first quarter financial results. Net revenue declined 6% better than our expectations, primarily due to stronger than expected cross-border volumes and lower client incentives. Value added services continue to perform well, growing 19%. It's important to note that had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, it would have had minimal impact on our Q1 net revenue growth, because payment volume growth was very similar across both quarters. Service revenues grew 5%, roughly in line with nominal payments volume growth last quarter. Data processing grew 6% with high teens, value added services growth continuing to be partially offset by the mix shift away from higher yielding cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 28%, 4 points better than cross-border volumes, excluding Intra-Europe due to favorable country mix and currency volatility benefits. Other revenues grew 5%, led by value added services, but continue to be negatively impacted by declines in the usage of travel related card benefits. Client incentives were 24.6% of gross revenues, approximately one point lower than expected. This was driven by three factors; first, a few large deals expected to be signed in the first quarter were delayed to the second quarter. Second, cross-border volume was better than we expected, particularly in the month of December. As we have said in the past, client incentives are mostly tied to payments volumes. So outperformance in high yielding cross-border volume lowers our incentives as a percent of gross revenues. And third, payments volume growth only improved a half point versus last quarter, as such there was minimal impact on current quarter client incentives from current quarter volume. On the operating expense front, we continue to benefit from actions we implemented last spring. Our headcount is lower, our spending on external services has been scaled back, travel continues to be very restricted and some marketing spend has been curtailed. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses declined 10%, which is better than expected partly due to timing shifts in client co-marketing, as well as certain product and technology investments to later in the year. Non-GAAP non-operating expense was $112 million for the fiscal quarter. This was over $30 million lower than expected due to two non-recurring items. First investment income tax deferred compensation was higher, this is offset in personnel costs and therefore income neutral. And second, an interest expense reserve was released, due to the conclusion of certain tax audits. The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected at 16.6%. During the quarter, the conclusion of tax audits in certain jurisdictions resulted in an $81 million benefit. In addition to this specific benefit, our tax rate is typically lower in the first quarter due to the impact of employee equity vesting. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS was $1.42, a decrease of 3%. We bought 8.7 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $202.30 for $1.8 billion this quarter. Our board has authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program, bringing total funds available for repurchases to over $11 billion. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned approximately $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. In December, we repaid $3 billion of debt upon maturity of senior notes issued five years ago. Moving on to some perspective on the second fiscal quarter, starting with business driver trends through January 21. Through January 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 12%, with us debit growing 30% and credit declining 6%. Debit growth is 10 points higher than the November, December run rate, fueled by government stimulus payments distributed right around January 1. Weekly growth trends show a sharp step up in growth in the first week of January and a step down in week three. January credit growth has slowed 3 points since December, which is more in line with the November trend. While U.S. payments volume growth has accelerated, there are many countries where constant dollar growth is slowing due to increased restrictions as COVID infections rise. In Asia-Pacific, Japan, Australia, India and Singapore payments volume growth has slowed 4 to 5 points versus December. In Europe, countries such as the UK, Italy, Denmark, and Germany all have at least 10 points slower growth in January. So far, growth rates are relatively steady in both EMEA and Latin America. Through January 21, processed transactions growth remained at 4% with acceleration in the U.S. offset by slowing growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Cross border volume excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis declined 33% in line with the first quarter, but below the trends we saw in December. In a fast changing environment, accurate forecasting remains difficult. How long will elevated spending driven by stimulus payments last? How long will stepped up restrictions and lockdowns persist? How will these two countervailing trends balance out country by country? Will cross border travel sustain the slow recovery even if some new restrictions go into place? These are just some of the uncertainties as we look ahead to the next three months. Based on the trends to this point, our best sense is that the second quarter gross revenue growth rate will recover to be flattish with last year, with most of the improvement driven by international revenues. Growth in the other revenue lines is expected to have a small uptick due to easier year-over-year comparisons in the second half of March. First quarter client incentives were a point below our expectations. Second quarter client incentives could be a point above the high end of the 25.5% to 26.5% range, we expect for the year. This would put first half incentives right in the middle of the range. There are several reasons for this type of client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the second quarter, even with continued improvement in cross border. First, as I mentioned earlier, a few large deals moved from the first to the second quarter one of which was Wells Fargo was signed in January as Al noted. Second, as we told you in October, many clients did not need certain volume thresholds in calendar year 2020, and as such did not earn corresponding incentives. As volume recovers in 2021, we expect clients will hit growth thresholds and earn these incentives. We accrue incentives accordingly, starting with the first quarter of the new calendar year. This causes a larger increase unique to the year of the recovery. And third, the impact of renewals we had already expected in the second quarter. Due to the step up in client incentives as a percent of gross revenue, the net revenue decline in the second quarter is expected to be comparable to the decline we reported in the first quarter, even as the growth, revenue growth rate continues to recover. Exchange rate shifts could benefit second quarter net revenue growth by less than a point. We expect operating expenses to grow in the low to mid-single digits in the second quarter, as we begin to lap the expense reductions implemented last year. We still plan to grow expenses in the double digits in the second half as we step up investments on three key growth initiatives in anticipation of a return to normal fee by the end of fiscal 2021. Non-operating expense should be $145 million, approximately, which is similar to the first quarter, if you exclude the two nonrecurring items I mentioned earlier. There is no change in our prior tax rate expectations. It is still too early to predict what impact the U.S. elections will have on our taxes. As always, we will provide updates as the year progresses. In summary, as you can see, our business remains resilient. Both debit and e-commerce growth are sustaining well above pre-COVID levels, as the accelerated shift to digital payments becomes a habit. Cross border growth is poised to recover sharply, once vaccines facilitate reopening of borders, and we lap last year steep declines. Our new flows and value added services businesses have continued to grow robustly through the worst of the pandemic. As Al indicated, we have stayed focused on our long-term growth initiatives, and will be stepping up the level of investment in the second half in anticipation of a post-COVID world with accelerating growth. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: We're now ready to take questions, Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead, sir.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask, strategically, how you're thinking about going forward post the Plaid deal that you decided to turn away from. And I guess, I'm looking for just comments of how you feel your relationships are with regulators and what makes sense in the future for future technology acquisitions, et cetera? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Well, thanks, James. Well, first of all, I mean, that's the last part of the question. This was a single lawsuit brought by a single regulator about one specific M&A transaction. So I don't believe that this portends anything about the future and our ability to continue to try to acquire companies. As we said a couple weeks ago, we ended up making the decision that this was just going to go on for too long. And we all know that the payments marketplace is moving with great speed on so many fronts. And the idea that we would tie ourselves up on this transaction, and frankly, the plan would tie themselves up through a long-term litigation that could go all the way through and appeal in and of itself which is not appealing to us, in terms of all the other things that we thought, we could be investing in and spending management time on and spending our dollars on. We're continuing to forge down a path of making sure that we are a real player in this space of open banking, and believe that we have a lot of the assets already. What Plaid was going to do was going to get us into specifically into the data extraction type of business, which would have added to our network of networks, but it doesn't in and of itself prevent us from doing more going forward. We also still have the ability in that space to partner with Plaid, we have the ability to partner with other players around the world. In many cases, that might give us the ability to partner with players that understand the nuances of specific markets in which they do work.  We'll continue to look to make sure that we to the degree that any use cases are going to form via the most -- the use case that probably would have the most chance of stepping out and being something that takes has some legs behind it would be account to account. And I think we're very well positioned there, we're positioned well to make sure that we can provide payments capabilities for the various FinTechs that we are doing business with today. And we have the ability to continue to sell value added services to all those players. So I think that ultimately, as we have in the past, we will invest to grow internally, we will look to partner and we will look to buy. And it will be a combination of capabilities and approaches that will allow us to continue to be a player in this space.\nJames Faucette: That's great context, Al. And just quick operational follow up. Obviously, you've taken expenses out of the cost base in the last year as a result of the pandemic. How should we think about what components of that cost base are likely to flow back in as things return to normal versus what could be more permanent changes?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think when you look at our cost base, the big parts of our cost base are people marketing and technology. And we think we have the Tokyo Olympics coming up in the summer months. I mean, there's some people that might be in some peril at the moment is going forward. We have marketing to really relatively modest levels in this past quarter. But I would certainly expect us to be driving marketing up. Basically, when we go to market, in our business it's a combination of putting people resources, our technology resources and our marketing muscle behind whatever we're doing. And so those are the areas that I would expect to see us grow going forward. And then of course, I mean, we really have dramatically curtailed TD and professional services. And I think that to the degree that later in the year, we begin to get some people back to offices, and we begin to see some people get back on airplanes, we'll see some modest increases in those expenses, those expense areas. So we've been really careful about both our people level spending in our technology level spending and our marketing level spending. And I think as conditions warrant, we'll be dialing those up. Vasant gave you some insight into where we think expenses are going to be in the second half. And we think there's some really good opportunities. And I want to make sure that if, in fact as we believe that will be in some form or normalcy by the end of this fiscal year, we want to make sure that we have good momentum going into fiscal '22.\nJames Faucette: Great color. Al, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks so much. I appreciate all the color on the volume trends. I want to ask about value added services that was up in the high teens. Curious how sustainable that is. And if that growth could actually step up with the eventual recovery in volume, just trying to understand how procyclical or not that business is?\nAl Kelly: Tien-Tsin, thank you. I guess a little bit of color for everybody, about two-thirds of our value added services are in data processing and they basically are transaction based revenue streams. And, that CyberSource that our risk and identity products that DPS and all of those will tend to continue to produce very good volumes and they'll move with transactions as transactions move. About a third of our value added services is split between our services revenue, which tends to be card benefits that are offered as a package. And then in other revenue, we have volumes that are -- I'm sorry, we have services not tied to volumes, things like consulting or practice and travel related card benefits that obviously have been down. So I think as travel would be to come back at some point that obviously would help that volume. So with that color we saw our, obviously in a world where e-commerce and omni commerce are becoming a big deal, cyber volume was very, very good and good revenue. We continue to have more and more customers engage with us on risk and identity services. And as I said earlier, now we're excited about the fact that we're going to take our debit processing system beyond the United States, and we've now got it, starting to use it in Europe. I think that that gives us a good platform for growth going forward as well.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Very good. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Tien-Tsin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Good evening. Al and Vasant, in terms of the cross border improvement, I thought that was actually pretty decent Q-over-Q improvement on the growth rate. Did the U.S. to lock in, instead of remain strong, but did it improve without a factor in the overall improve year-over-year?\nAl Kelly: Don, in Latin America, it was really U.S. to Mexico and U.S. to the Caribbean, that drove Dubai and North America. Beyond that, Dubai opened a bit, now Dubai is having a little bit of resurgence and just went back into some restrictions in earlier this week. But Dubai has been open, and there's been a decent amount of travel into the Middle East. There's been a fair little bit of an opening amongst the countries in the former Soviet Union, and then there's been some improvement or some movement in intra-travel within South America. So those are kind of the spots where we've seen the improvements in cross border. Most of the rest of the corridors around the world continue to be as Vasant mentioned in his remarks, either closed or subject to like, really tough restrictions that make it very difficult for company to take on traveling.\nDon Fandetti: And Al, as you look at these numbers, are you still feeling like the data point suggests there's a fair amount of pent up demand when things do open up?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think, Don, as it relates to consumer travel, which is the vast majority of our payment volume in the travel sector over the years, I do think we're going to see some opening for sure. I think there's a lot of pent up demand. I mean, there's a lot of people who haven't seen family, parents who haven't seen grandchildren, children who haven't seen parents, and are going to want to jump on planes. I also think a lot of people are stir crazy and want to get out. And then you've got people who are true global citizens who\u2019re knocking things off their to-do list and in terms of places they want to go and things in places they want to see. So I think consumer travel at the right time, but we need to see these restrictions be mitigated or lessened in pretty big way. I think it's going to come back quite strongly. I think it's going to take more time to see business travel come back. And frankly, it might take years for business travel to return to what it is. I mean, we've all gotten accustomed to talking on video conferences, et cetera. And I think we all probably realize that there are trips that we took are authorized in the past that when we look back on it today, in the light of talking on video, we say why did we send somebody to that meeting for 1.5 hour presentation that they could have just as well done on video. So that's the way I think about it going forward, Don.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Good afternoon. Thank you. A follow-up question from me on Visa Direct, which will highlight it again grew almost 60% in the quarter. At your Investor Day last February, you had sized to the B2C, G2C and P2P markets about 60 trillion in total payment volume. And I believe Visa Direct did about 350 billion last year, so about 0.5% of that. Can you talk about over time, as you're seeing Visa Direct develop, how much of those markets do you think is potentially addressable by Visa Direct? And any hint of the monetization level that we should be thinking about something similar to domestic debit or different from that. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Lisa, thank you for the question. Visa Direct has the ability to grow on a number of vectors. The two that, I think are the most obvious is, in terms of, well, three, I'd say; continued penetration of current use cases, new use cases that had developed, and then thirdly, geographic expansion. And this is a business that we're still building out. There's still lot to do in all three of those categories. And to an earlier question, I think Don asked, we're going to continue to invest in that area and look at these markets where we haven't even really laid any track for Visa Direct is use cases where we haven't laid any track. And our plan is to continue to do that. If we look at the very first Visa Direct use case, which continues to grow substantially P2P payments, there's still lots to do, both in domestic P2P payments, but we think a key future growth area is in cross-border P2P and remittance and we're beginning to take steps there to enable that. And I mentioned in my remarks the fact that we've got relationships with four of the five top global money transfer operators. And that's helping us quite a bit. I think earn ways to access, really continues to be a real opportunity, I touched a little bit on a few of those cases, but there's still lots of geographies and lots of organizations that we have the ability to penetrate, to grow that. And then you've got all these, B2C use cases, things like food and grocery delivery and online gaming and insurance claim payouts. So, all of those are, I would say in the early innings of a baseball game in terms of our ability to continue to make progress and drive those. So I continue to believe that this platform off which we can generate dozens and dozens of use cases, both will for quite some time be really important to us from a growth perspective.\nLisa Ellis: Very exciting. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thank you, Lisa.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Chris Brendler with Seaport Global. You may go ahead.\nChris Brendler: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Al, it sounds -- I'd love to hear your thoughts on the buy now pay later phenomenon that seems to be gathering steam. And I know you have a solution there. And how big do you think that solution could become and a very competitive threat from consumers choosing a different payment option at checkout when they're checking online?\nAl Kelly: Well, Chris, this is a pretty interesting space, and I think we're in the early days in most markets. There's a number of different models. I think I said before, I think Vasant said before, we're not in the business of picking winners and losers. We see our job as enablement, no matter what the model is. But, in some cases, the player is the actual lender, in some cases, they're sourcing a lender, in some cases, the installments are very short term, weeks at a time, in some cases they're long-term. Some providers only do installment, some allow multiple payment options, pay now, pay on delivery, pay off on various numbers of installments. And then obviously where it gets exciting for us, multiple ways to pay off installments, virtual cards, debit cards, ACH. And, it's also a payment model today that's heavily funded by the merchant. Our strategy, Chris, is to be brought to play with multiple third party providers and offer our Visa platform to enable issuers to offer pay now, buy now, pay now, pay later capability. And we seek to work with all these options. And obviously, what we want to do is get virtual cards from Visa in place as one option for repayment. We also want to put Visa cards on file as another option. And I would remind you that these installments do break at its core, these installments break a transaction or a purchase into three or four or five payment transactions, which is good for us, because it gives us more transactions on which to earn fees.\nChris Brendler: That's great. One quick follow if I may. In places like Sweden, where it's become the dominant tender share, did it actually -- do you actually see an impact on volume or enough people choosing your cards that this will actually impact the volume and given how much growth in buy now pay later is taking place in that area?\nAl Kelly: So there is a few countries you mentioned, Sweden, another one is Australia. There's not many, there's two countries where this has really taken off. And I think it certainly has had some impact on banks in those markets. But in many cases, because of the kind of pay off capabilities, I talked about card on file, virtual cards and et cetera, a lot of that buys coming back to us in the form of repayments.\nChris Brendler: That's awesome. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe. You may go ahead, sir.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. Just one quick one for Vasant and then Al, just a more structural. And so I'll just if I can just do them all, both at once. So when we looked at the incentive side, I know you guys said that it was timing related, it came in below the range this quarter, but it'll come in high that you said higher than the range or potentially could be for the next quarter. When we think about when you first guided to the 25, 25.5 range, it was embedding cross border activity similar to the September quarter, which was ended up being better. So I guess I just want to know, you're assuming now some deterioration or more conservatism in cross border before maybe gets better later in the year. And then I guess Al, maybe I could just squeeze in structurally again, things like debit are better seeming to be somewhat sustainable. It's not all just people using more non-discretionary. I'm curious what you would identify now after having seen about a year of the pandemic, where are the top two or three items, you think structurally are impacting your business longer term and here to stay potentially?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, just taking the incentives question, we try to give you a best sense of a range. And at this point, the visibility is greatest in the first half, since we're halfway through it and we think we'll be right in the middle of the range. There are many variables here that go into it and a time like this, when things are moving around quite a bit, certainly cross border doing better helps. Renewals will have an impact sometimes they happen when we expect sometimes they don't. There's also the year-over-year improvement that our clients have. As you know, last year, many clients because of the pandemic didn't hit certain thresholds, this year things are recovering faster. There could be, they will be thing they'll all make that threshold and more; that has a year-over-year impact, and it varies by client. So there's a bunch of these things moving around at the same time. And the good news is, you know, we think we're right in the middle of the range, and we'll give you more as we go through the year.\nAl Kelly: Darrin on your second question, first of all, there's many reasons why debit has been a star here, not that you've got the stimulus payments that are on prepaid cards, we count prepaid in our debit business. As e-commerce is moved into more everyday categories, people are using debit, people are more comfortable in tough situations, tough times to use money they have versus borrow money that they don't have. But I think when I looked ahead structurally, to answer your question, look I think e-commerce adaption is probably accelerated three to five years in the last year. And I don't think that's going backward. I think that people who have gotten used to shopping on the phone or their tablet or their computer are going to continue to do that. I think the other thing that I look at structurally that's really exciting is there's great opportunity to continue to grow both sides of this two sided market of buyers and sellers. Wallet proliferation is continuing and we're working really hard to get credentials in wallets, which adds to these wallets in essence are becoming issuers and that helps on generate more buyers. And the cost of acceptance is going down around the world, as more and more players are getting into it. And that's going to grow the number of sellers on our network and that network grows, I think that's going to be a really positive thing for us. Obviously, e-commerce comes with the issue of no cash. But I think that people are getting increasingly concerned about cash and the combination of tap to pay in the physical world where the card doesn't need to leave your hands to go to anybody else in order to transact. And the fact that e-commerce doesn't free cash is not an option. Those are all of those things I think structurally are very positive for us. The thing on the flip side, I also I mentioned that while business travel is a small piece of our overall travel, that will be one of the things that will be a little bit slower to come back and maybe never back at the level it was pre-COVID-19.\nDarrin Peller: That\u2019s really helpful, guys. Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Vasant, I wanted to ask about cross-border as that comes back especially likely in this second half of this calendar year. How do we think about the higher yields and profitability? How that will flow to the bottom line versus additional investments you talk about? What would necessarily be those investments where they offset completely the benefit we'll see from that cross border?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, I mean, there's no question cross-border coming back has a meaningful impact on our revenue line. You saw that already in the first quarter, our cross-border was better than we expected. And as a result, our revenues were also quite a bit better than we expected. We're saying that we will step up our investment in the second half and expect our expenses to grow double digits. But, if the cross-border business comes back in a meaningful way, I mean, that's clearly going to be much better growth on the top-line than that double digit increase in expenses that we're planning. Also, you should remember that we start lapping the declines in our expenses from last year. Our expenses last year declined by 5% or so in the second half. So when we grow them double digits this fiscal year, in the second half, over a two year period we\u2019re only growing them about 5%. So net, net, I mean, cross-border coming back is going to have a very positive impact on our business, especially if it comes back faster than we might be expecting. In any case, the comparisons get better, so you will begin to see growth in the cross-border business just because of what happened last year.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. You may go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on your volume metrics. If I compare your metrics relative to your closest peers, over the last two quarters, we've seen the reversal of Europe and U.S. volume growth rate has been faster than your peers. How should we think about that? Is it some deal flow coming in, your partnerships with FinTechs, the Visa Direct in the numbers? Any color there that would be helpful. Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Well, it's always a variety of reasons, depending on what the components of the business you're looking at. I mean, clearly the mix of the business between debit and credit has an impact. You all know that debit has clearly outperformed as the primary driver of cash conversion globally. And then in those parts of the world like the U.S., where debit has been a mechanism for distribution of stimulus payments, it's also benefited from that. So mix of business makes a big difference. We're not seeing any reason why debit will not continue to outperform and credit is recovering and that's a positive trend. If you look at places around the world, I mean, in Europe, the bulk of the slowdown from Q1 to Q2 was the fact that we had that benefit in the first quarter. We've had some small impact from restrictions. But unless restrictions are becoming more significant, this trend seems to be improving almost everywhere. You saw that in Latin America and EMEA, we saw meaningful acceleration. And we're not seeing much impact on those trends from additional cases. So overall, the U.S., as I said in my comments, it's almost as if the pandemic didn't happen. Like we grew around 8% first quarter last year. We grew 8% again first quarter this year where if you believe our growth rate is 8% or 9%, we're almost back on the growth rate. Internationally, we're getting there and we think that trend is meaningfully improving, as you saw. Where we are lagging, certainly where the trend is still soft as Asia, where restrictions remain still significant. And in Europe, there\u2019s some increasing restrictions now and we\u2019ll see how they play out.\nAl Kelly: Thank you. Mitchell, we\u2019ll take one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. You may go ahead, sir.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Al, hi, Vasant. So questions on pricing. Wondering if -- and I know you price for value, but kind of wondering as the economy hopefully gets better how you think of pricing? Is there perhaps a catch up in pricing? Do you revert to normalize long-term pattern? Or do you just see a tougher environment for pricing within the interchange model? And then so the addendum to that is, is there a natural benefit from Brexit? Its news flow couple days back about that, and how do you account for that?\nAl Kelly: Well, I'll make a couple of comments and Vasant can certainly add. On answer on your last point, I'm not going to make any comments on the Brexit situation, we've not announced anything, and therefore I don't think it's prudent to comment. I think that we made some decisions to delay pricing out of this past year, because of the realities of COVID. But we plan to move ahead with previously delayed pricing increases in April of this year. We also have a small number of minor pricing changes. The impact won't be very big. And I think going forward, I think we continue to deliver the value that we want to deliver, I think that there's opportunity across all three of our growth strategies, core payments, new flows and value added services to look at pricing. Vasant, you add or add anything.\nVasant Prabhu: No. Nothing more to add.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Great. Thank you, guys.\nMike Milotich: Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again and have a great evening.\nOperator: And thank you.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Visa\u2019s performance in 2022 was very strong even with the uncertainty created by inflation, the war in Ukraine, COVID, the timing of cross-border travel recovery and a potential recession. On a full year basis, credentials increased 9% year-over-year and are up 13% excluding Russia. We crossed 4.8 billion tokens surpassing the number of card credentials and almost doubling from last year. Merchant locations, including locations from payment facilitators grew 11%. Global Tap to Pay penetration grew 10% -- 10 points to 54% of face-to-face transactions excluding Russia and this was helped by 20 additional countries crossing over the 50% penetration mark. Excluding the U.S. and Russia, global Tap to Pay penetration was 71%. Visa\u2019s network processed 70% more Tap to Ride transactions on global transit systems in FY 2022, surpassing 1 billion transactions for the first time ever. In FY 2022, we signed over 400 commercial partnerships with fintechs globally from early-stage companies to growing and mature players. Visa Direct had 5.9 billion transactions excluding Russia, across 60 plus use cases and over 2,000 programs helped by more than 500 enablers. Over half of our clients utilized five or more value-added services in 2022 and a third used 10 or more. All of this helped to drive fiscal full year net revenues up 22% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $7.50, up 27%. Now let me transition to our fourth quarter performance and key highlights and then make a few comments about 2023. Fourth quarter net revenues grew 19% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, up 19%. Total Q4 payments volume was up 10% year-over-year or 135% versus three years ago, down 1 point from Q3. Excluding Russia and China, payments volume was up 16% or 145% of 2019. U.S. Q4 payments volume was up 12% year-over-year or 145% of 2019, down 1 point. International volume was up 9% year-over-year or 126% of 2019, down 1 point versus Q3. Excluding Russia and China, International volume was up 20% or 146% of 2019, flat to Q3. Q4 cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe were up 49% year-over-year and 130% versus three years ago, up 7 points from Q3. Excluding Russia, cross-border year-over-year growth was higher by about 5 points. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 12 points from 104% of 2019 in Q3 to 116% in Q4 as travel continued to recover. Processed transactions were up 12% year-over-year or 140% versus 2019 and we processed 553 million transactions a day during the quarter. Now I will provide an update on the drivers that propel this growth in consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Our consumer payment strategy has three components to it, growing credentials, increasing acceptance and deepening engagement. Total consumer payments revenue for the fourth quarter and the year were both up more than 20% in constant dollars. On the credential side, we signed several significant deals with financial institution clients, co-brands and fintechs in the fourth quarter. Starting with financial institution clients in our Asia-Pacific region, we signed with China Construction Bank, Bank of Communications and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, leading banks in China. Throughout fiscal year 2022, we have renewed with eight of our top China issuers. In our CEMEA region, we signed with National Bank of Kuwait, the largest bank in Kuwait, and ADIB, the largest Islamic issuer in the UAE. In Latin America, we renewed and expanded our partnership relationship with the second largest bank in Colombia, Banco Davivienda, including credit, debit, commercial and Visa Direct. Another key renewal in Latin America this quarter was with Dock, one of the Visa\u2019s a few full stock enablers providing BINs [ph] sponsorship, issuer processing, acquiring as a service and program management via a single connection, already servicing more than 100 fintechs in Brazil, Dock will expand across new markets, including Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, the Dominican Republic and Ecuador. In Europe, we renewed and expanded our relationship with UBS, the largest issuer in Switzerland. We made excellent progress in Germany with our share growing significantly since 2018, adding more than 12 million debit credentials in the market. Visa Debit is now offered by three of the most significant banks in the market, ING, DKB and comdirect. And we are also pleased to announce that Santander Germany will begin issuance in 2023, making Visa the single scheme of choice for Santander in that country across debit and credit. Altogether, across the European continent, our quarterly active credentials were up 18% year-over-year. In the co-brand space, we continue to expand our position in several countries with two recent wins and an extension. First, in India with the Samsung co-brand card targeting existing and prospective Samsung users. Second, in the U.S., Visa and Kohl\u2019s with Capital One as the issuer recently entered into an agreement to launch at Kohl\u2019s co-branded Visa credit card. And also in the U.S., we are excited to share that Visa signed a multiyear co-brand agreement extension with Disney for cards issued by JPMorgan Chase. Now moving to fintech and wallet clients. In Egypt, mobile network operated Etisalat Egypt with more than 28 million customers has signed a deal for virtual and physical card issuance. The first digital bank in Iraq, Visa Iraq Islamic banks seeking to digitize payments and drive a cashless society through Visa credit, debit and prepaid card issuance across their 400,000 customers. And large cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, with over 5 million registered users has signed on to expand issuance of Visa credentials beyond the U.S. to over 40 countries, bringing our total number of issuing partnerships with crypto platforms to more than 70. Finally, GoHenry Group is the U.S., U.K. and Europe-based fintech that provides prepaid cards and financial education app for children age six to 18 to over 2 million members. They will be expanding their U.K. Visa issuance to Continental Europe and the U.S. On the acceptance front, we signed an agreement with Flywire, a global payments enabler and software company that supports the higher education industry to grow card acceptance in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Korea. In Mexico, we renewed our relationship with Clip, an important payment facilitator, which will aid in the expansion of acceptance to micro, small and medium merchants. In Mexico, we have more than doubled acceptance since 2019 to nearly 3 million merchant locations. Our efforts across Latin America to grow acceptance and win processing share has paid off. Outside of Brazil, we have expanded our processing penetration by more than 20 points since 2019, with the migrations of domestic transactions in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and, most recently, Uruguay. Customer engagement is very important, and Tap to Pay is one of the best ways to pay in the face-to-face environment. In Q4, the U.S. reached 28% penetration and saw more than 1 billion tap monthly transactions for the first time ever in July, surpassing the U.K. as the largest country for Tap to Pay transactions and this is nearly double the number of transactions from last year and more than 5 times the number of transactions from two years ago. Now moving on to new flows, which grew fourth quarter and full year revenue over 20% in constant dollars. Our B2B business had nearly $1.5 trillion in payments volume for the full year, growing 30% in constant dollars. In the fourth quarter, B2B payments volume was almost $400 billion, growing 21% year-over-year in constant dollars. Within B2B, our strategy is focused on card-based payments, cross-border payments and accounts receivable and accounts payable payments, and we have made progress across all three this quarter. Visa has signed a long-term agreement with European payments as a service provider, Modulr, to issue Visa virtual cards to support B2B travel clients issuing out of Europe. Also in Europe, Visa won the credit card portfolio, Cr\u00e9dit du Nord, encompassing Societe Generale in addition to renewing consumer credit and debit portfolios in both industries. We also recently reached a new fleet product partnership agreement with Edenred, I am sorry, which is making their Edenred essentials product available to commercial and public sector organizations with vehicles in the United States. In cross-border flows, we signed an agreement with Visa B2B Connect with TD Bank, our first bank in Canada. We also signed banks for the first time in Switzerland and Korea. And recently, our CEMEA region signed five banks across Kazakhstan, Qatar and Azerbaijan. In the accounts receivable and payable space, MineralTree, a U.S. automated invoice-to-payment solution provider for the middle market and enterprise businesses, recently enhanced their relationship with Visa to support cards for their payables customers. For other new flows, Visa Direct grew transactions 36% this year excluding Russia, reaching 5.9 billion transactions. In the fourth quarter, Visa Direct had 1.7 billion transactions and grew 42%, up 7 points from Q3. In addition to growing the existing Visa Direct business, our strategy for growth includes; one, scaling new use cases with a particular focus on cross-border; two, expanding existing use cases to new geographies; and three, accelerating through enablers. In terms of scaling new use cases, I am pleased that eBay, one of the largest third-party marketplaces in the world has enabled faster payouts for its sellers via Visa Direct in the U.S. We recently signed a deal in the U.S. with Gopuff, a consumer goods and food delivery service with millions of customers across hundreds of U.S. cities, to provide their delivery partners the ability to cash out their earnings balance in real-time. In terms of bringing existing use cases to new geographies, in addition to some of the issuing deals I mentioned earlier, we have also signed Visa Direct deals with China Construction Bank and Etisalat Egypt. Other new geographies also include Norway, Norwegian mobile payment application, Vipps, will offer users access to Visa Direct for all domestic payments. This will improve the card-based experience for Vipps, roughly 4.3 million users covering over 80% of Norway\u2019s population. On the enabler strategy, Square has expanded their instant transfers to Canada, offering their business as a way to have faster merchant settlement opportunities. U.S. money movement automation platform, Astra, is using Visa Direct to let developers add real-time transfer functionality to their applications. So millions of its end users can fund cards, wallets and demand deposit accounts with their eligible debit cards. Visa Direct has extensive reach, including more than 3 billion cards and over 2 billion accounts. Recently, Visa Direct has signed with Singapore-based payments infrastructure platform, Thunes, with a network of mobile wallets across 44 countries and territories. Our partnership will add a send-to-wallet capability with either direct through Thunes\u2019 B2B payment platform and provide access to 78 already integrated digital wallet providers, representing over 1.5 billion digital wallets globally. So with this partnership, we will expand our total reach to nearly 7 billion end points covering cards, accounts and wallets. As part of new flows, aligned with our global network of network strategy, we are focused on building the infrastructure that enables our clients to deliver cross-border products and services for their customers. One of our newest capabilities in this space, Currencycloud, signed 35 new partnerships this quarter, including Paycent, a global end-to-end payment platform with over 7 million customers and 17,000 SMEs. Paycent intends to expand capabilities of its Paycent business platform for clients to collect and hold up to 34 currencies and seamlessly convert funds back to the required currency at competitive FX rates. Now moving to value-added services, which had $6 billion in revenue for 2022, up 20% in constant dollars. For the fourth quarter, revenues were up $1.7 billion and grew 20% in cost dollars as well. Our strategy here is also three-fold; one, to deepen client penetration of existing products; two, to build new products and launch new solutions; and three, to extend geographically. On the first, deepen client penetration of existing products, let\u2019s explore two of our largest value-added services businesses, DPS, debit processing services and CyberSource. DPS, our issuer processing business, hit a major milestone, exceeding $2 trillion in annual authorization volume in FY 2022. DPS has also renewed with nearly 30 clients, representing over $600 billion in annual DPS processed authorization volume. CyberSource remains a compelling gateway solution for merchants and most recently signed McDonald\u2019s, Little Caesars and JetBlue. We also continue to expand CyberSource relationships with acquirers, first with the Bank of New Zealand, New Zealand\u2019s largest acquirer. Together with Japanese acquired SMCC, CyberSource continues to provide payment processing solutions for more than 100,000 terminals in both card-present and card-not-present environment. SMCC is also leveraging CyberSource\u2019s capabilities for value-added services such as fraud management. Most recently, CyberSource is powering SMCC\u2019s expansion of the EMV transit acceptance and supporting commercial and pilot launches with 24 different transit operators across Japan. Deutsche Bank will offer CyberSource\u2019s Decision Manager to its merchants so that they can receive a risk value for each e-commerce transaction using rules and AI to help prevent online retail fraud. On the second strategy, build new products and launch great new solutions, our recently acquired capability, Tink, is a real example. Tink recently signed Adyen to offer a white-label pay-by-bank open banking solution on its single platform. Adyen will utilize Tink\u2019s payment initiation technology, so businesses can enable account-to-account payments. Adyen\u2019s open banking integration will launch first in the U.K. with plan to expand to multiple markets during 2023. Last quarter, I mentioned our newly developed risk-as-a-service capabilities powered by our network level data, AI capabilities and our risk experts. Recently, Navy Federal in the U.S. and several banks in CEMEA signed engagements for the service, which aims to deliver enhanced fraud prevention and management. On our third strategy is to extend geographically, in many cases, through tailored solutions. Since our acquisition of Visa Europe, we have made significant effort to bring value-added services to clients. Across Europe, clients enrolling onto Visa advance through authentication and Visa risk management products tripled between October 2019 and September 2022. And these clients span across 14 different European countries. In CEMEA, Visa Risk Manager launched a network-agnostic pilot with Emirates NBD, a leading issuer in the UAE. As part of Visa\u2019s network of network strategy, network-agnostic VRM will allow clients to manage card payment risk across their entire portfolio. We recently brought our Buy Now, Pay Later solution to Canada and have continued to make progress adding some of Canada\u2019s largest merchants, including Simon\u2019s and Canada Computers. And RBC and Visa have entered into an agreement to launch the Visa Installment solution on eligible RBC consumer credit cards. In conclusion, our 2022 performance was very strong and demonstrated that our strategy for each of our growth levers are delivering. We see new flows as a way to drive additional volumes and transactions and value-added services as a way to drive additional yield on existing volumes and transactions. Vasant is going to go into a lot more detail, but let me make four points about 2023. One, in the year ahead, I see significant opportunity for the business across all three of our growth areas, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Two, we faced some headwinds, in particular, lapping Visa and a challenging FX environment. Three, we did not factor a steep economic downturn or a recession into our numbers. To the one -- to the extent one occurs, it will have some impact. Four, we will continue to manage our business for the medium- and long-term, and we will invest in initiatives that are compelling and will provide future growth. That said, we recognize that some economies around the world could face increased pressure. So we will be monitoring things very closely. We will, as we have in past periods, be flexible and prudent in the management of our expenses. As a leadership team, we have demonstrated Visa\u2019s ability to manage through many different environments, and I remain confident that our strategy will continue to position Visa at the center of money movement for years to come. With that, over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal fourth quarter results reflect sustained strength in domestic spending and continued recovery in cross-border travel. Net revenues were up 19% and GAAP EPS was up 13%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 19%. The strong dollar was a stiff headwind, dragging down reported net revenue growth by 4 points and non-GAAP EPS growth also by 4 points. Discontinuation of operations in Russia reduced net revenue growth by about 5 points. A few key highlights, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 10% year-over-year and 35% above 2019. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 16% year-over-year and 45% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 45% above 2019. In constant dollars, international payments volume, excluding China and Russia, was up 20% year-over-year and 46% above 2019. The cross-border travel recovery continues. However, the pace of recovery has moderated as most borders are now open, except China. Index to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe rose 12 points in the fourth quarter versus a 22-point gain in the third quarter. Our three growth engines, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues in excess of 20% in constant dollars. In fiscal year 2022, we bought back $11.6 billion of stock at an average price of $205.97. Contributions to the litigation escrow account, which have the same effect as a stock buyback, added another $850 million. We also paid out $3.2 billion in dividends. At the end of September, we had $5.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. In October, our Board authorized a new $12 billion stock buyback program and increased our dividend by 20%. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 17% year-over-year to 36% over 2019, helped by travel and entertainment spending. U.S. debit grew 7%. Relative to 2019, debit was up 54%, sustaining significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. U.S. cost present spend grew 11% year-over-year and was 27% above 2019. Card-not-present volume excluding travel grew 10% year-over-year and was 68% higher than 2019. E-commerce spending remained well above the pre-COVID trend line even as card-present spend continue to recover. On the International front, Latin America was up 33% year-over-year and 109% higher than 2019. Our CEMEA region excluding Russia grew 32% year-over-year and was 105% higher than 2019. Growth in both regions was fueled by client wins, cash digitization and acceptance expansion. Europe was up 12% year-over-year and 34% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion underway in the U.K. Ex-U.K., Europe volumes grew 30% year-over-year and was 67% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Asia-Pacific excluding China continues to recover, up 26% year-over-year and 32% above 2019. Global process transactions were up 12% year-over-year and 40% over 2019 levels. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, but including Russia in prior periods were up 49% year-over-year and 30% over 2019. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by approximately 5 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe grew 12% year-over-year and was 60% above 2019. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe grew 101% year-over-year and is now 16% above 2019. The cross-border travel index to 2019 went from 112 in June to 115 in July to 118 in September. While the recovery continues, the rate of improvement from month-to-month has slowed as borders ex-China are now open. Travel in and out of Asia recovered sharply in the quarter, up 16 points from the high 15 to the mid-70s index to 2019. There is more recovery to come in Asia, especially when China starts to lift restrictions. Summer travel in and out of Europe was also very strong, with a travel index to 2019 in the 130s, up 13 points from the third quarter. European travel appears to have benefited most from the strong dollar. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continued to pick up steam, rising to the mid-130s index to 2019, up 10 points from the third quarter. However, the inbound travel recovery was sluggish, still indexing in the low 90s and up only 4 points. The strong dollar and delays in Visa issuance from some countries appear to be impacting travel into the U.S. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean remained very strong and stable, indexing around 150 to 2019 levels. Finally, travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the mid-1 20s relative to 2019, up 10 points in the quarter. Moving now to a quick review of fourth quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 11% versus the 12% growth in Q3 constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag more than offset growth from utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 10% versus the 12% of this transaction growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia. However, our transactions growth is not. Adjusted for Russia, data processing revenues were up 15%. International transaction revenues were up 52% versus the 49% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and pricing actions more than offsetting the impact of the strong dollar. Other revenues grew 13% led by travel related programs and pricing actions. Client incentives were 26.9% of gross revenues in line with expectations. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines, each growing more than 20% on a constant dollar basis. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by carded B2B recovery. Commercial card volumes grew 21% year-over-year and are up 43% versus 2019, and excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 42%. Value-added services growth was driven by higher volume, increased client penetration and select pricing actions. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. GAAP operating expenses grew 20%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 18%. The inclusion of Currencycloud and Tink added about 3 points. Exchange rates were about a 4.5 point benefit. We stepped up investment in our business in the second half of the year as the recovery trajectory accelerated. Personnel costs were also higher due to annual salary increases granted a quarter earlier than our normal cycle and higher incentive compensation accruals. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $122 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $99 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates. GAAP EPS was $1.86. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, up 19% over last year, inclusive of a 4-point drag from the strong dollar. For the full year, net revenues increased 22%, and non-GAAP EPS of $7.50 was up 27%, with exchange rates reducing reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth by over 2 points each. We are now in fiscal year 2023 and through the first three weeks of October, business trends have remained strong and stable. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 11%, with debit up 9% and credit up 14%. U.S. spend growth versus 2019 was up 47%, with debit up 57% and credit up 39%. These trends are consistent with the fourth quarter and with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 12% year-over-year, up 40% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe grew 42% year-over-year and was 33% over 2019. Card-not-present non-travel growth were 61% above 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 18% above 2019. Moving now to our perspectives for the coming year. Forecasting four quarters ahead has been difficult through the COVID years. While COVID impact is now largely behind us, as you all know, we are in a very uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. As we have said before, we are not economic forecasters. Clearly, there\u2019s a high risk of a global recession, but we do not have a specific point of view on if, when or the kind of recession we might have. For internal planning purposes, we are assuming no recession. Of course, we will stay very vigilant, closely monitoring our trends day-by-day. We will stay very flexible. We will have contingency plans in place should we have an economic or geopolitical shock that impacts our business. And we will be prepared to act fast should we need to. So that is the context for our planning assumptions, which I will walk through now, starting with revenue drivers. Payments volume and processed transaction indexed to 2019 have been very stable in the U.S. and globally for the past three quarters. In other words, we believe the recovery from COVID is behind us when it comes to domestic spending. We are assuming this stability sustains through fiscal year 2023 with normal year-over-year growth rates in the low-double digits for both business drivers. On payments volumes, Russia will impact growth rates in the first half. Russia will not impact reported processed transactions growth. Cross-border e-commerce trends have also been stable, especially when you adjust for Russia and crypto-related volatility. We are assuming cross-border e-commerce growth rate sustain in the mid-teens, excluding Russia and crypto, and in the low-double digits with Russia and crypto impact included. Cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe, has continued to recover but at a slower pace, up 6 points from 112 to 118 index to 2019 between June and September. For planning purposes, we are assuming that this recent month-to-month pace of recovery sustains through fiscal year 2023. As was the case last year, there will be periods of deceleration and acceleration. Hopefully, China starts easing restrictions as we enter calendar year 2023. Two variables will have a significant impact on our reported revenue growth in fiscal year 2023, Russia and the dollar, which has strengthened to extraordinary levels through fiscal year 2022. Since we discontinued operations in late March, Russia will reduce first half fiscal year 2023 revenue growth by over 4 points, with 4 points in the first quarter and as much as 5 points in the second quarter. But as you might recall, we recorded two quarters worth of service fees in fiscal year 2022. Russia will obviously have no impact in the second half. Russia will reduce full year net revenue growth by 5 points. We faced very stiff exchange rate headwinds as we enter fiscal year 2023. Based on where the dollar is today and the forward curve, exchange rates will reduce reported net revenue growth in fiscal year 2023 by around 4 points. Since the dollar strengthened through fiscal year 2022, the impact is greater in the first quarter at around 5 points, around 4.5 points in the second quarter and moderate through the year. When you pull all this together, our planning assumptions get us to mid-teens constant dollar net revenue growth on a run rate basis, i.e., adjusted for Russia. With a 2-point Russia impact and a 4-point exchange rate headwind, reported nominal dollar fiscal year 2023 net revenue growth would be in the high-single digits. Client incentives are expected to be in the 26.5% to 27.5% range as a percent of gross revenues. With a 4-point Russia drag and a stiffer exchange rate headwind, first half reported nominal dollar net revenue growth is expected to be lower than the second half, lowest growth in the second quarter, which has the largest Russia impact and stepping up in the third and fourth quarters with no Russia drag and hopefully a moderating exchange rate headwind. Moving on to operating expenses. We are managing expense growth in line with our revenue growth expectations, rigorously prioritizing investment plans. As you know, this is a long cycle business. Investments we make today will have revenue growth two year to three years out. It is important for us to continue to fund key growth initiatives across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. As Al said, we have extraordinary growth opportunities and need to ensure we are investing to realize their potential. Our current plans are for low double-digit non-GAAP operating expense growth in constant dollars, high single digits in nominal dollars, Tink and Currencycloud, which closed during fiscal year 2022 at about 1 point to expense growth, offset by the discontinuation of Russia operations and exchange rate changes, which are expected to be about a 1.5 point benefit each. Non-GAAP operating expense growth will be higher in the first half for two reasons. First, Tink and Currencycloud add 2 points to expense growth in the first half. Also in the first half, we lapped a lower expense base last year since we stepped up investment spending through the year as the cross-border recovery accelerated. As such, non-GAAP expense growth in nominal dollars is expected to be in the low-double digits in the first half and at the high end of mid-single digits in the second half, highest in the first quarter, which is also impacted by the FIFA World Cup and moderating through the year. Should there be a recession or a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our planning assumptions, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel and other controllable categories. In a business like ours, this always requires a careful balance between short- and long-term considerations. As interest rates have risen, non-operating expense will benefit from higher interest income from our cash balances. We currently expect non-operating expense to be in the $200 million, $250 million range for fiscal year 2023. We will provide quarterly updates through the year. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in FY 2023. Honing in on the first quarter, based on everything I just walked through, we expect reported nominal dollar net revenue growth in the high single-digit range, with client incentives on par with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. Nominal dollar non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to be in the low teens. The tax rate could be lower than the 19% to 19.5% range in the first quarter, depending on the resolution of some items. Second quarter net revenue growth is expected to be lower than the first quarter because of the Russia impact, which is higher. Second quarter operating expense growth is also expected to moderate to the low end of double digits. In summary, we assume stable conditions through fiscal year 2023. We are prepared to act fast should circumstances change. Regardless of near-term uncertainties, we remain as certain as we have ever been about our extraordinary long-term growth opportunity. There is still plenty of cash to digitize in core consumer payments. We are accelerating volume growth by vastly expanding the use cases we can serve through our new flows business, while enhancing the yield on transactions in our network by layering on value-added services. With that, I will turn this back to Jennifer.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Vasant. And with that, we are ready to take questions, Holly.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Al. I wanted to follow up on your comment in the prepared remarks about Visa now having 4.3 billion tokens, up doubling more than 2x year-on-year. Can you elaborate a bit on a couple of aspects of tokenization? First, have you made any progress or what level of progress have you made on selling your tokenization services as a value-added service into other networks -- alternative networks? And then also on some of -- given that you don\u2019t monetize tokens directly, what -- how should we think about the indirect benefits of tokenization to Visa now that the number of tokens exceeds card credentials out there? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Yeah. It\u2019s 4 point -- I think you said 4.3 billion, Lisa. It\u2019s 4.8 billion. We have had some but not a tremendous amount of success yet in terms of selling tokens into other networks. We view it as a -- we play a critical role in the ecosystem and we view tokenization as critical to the security of the ecosystem and then, ultimately, the trust of the ecosystem as it relates to card transactions that convert get -- their cards converted to token. So over time, we expect this to have very positive impacts on our issuers and merchants in terms of fraud. There are a few cases, the clearinghouse being one, global payments being another where I know that we are getting revenue today from the tokenization capability that we are building for them.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much. Could you gauge the impact on processed transaction growth for FY 2023 from U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s enforcement of two unaffiliated networks to process every online U.S. debit transaction beginning July 1, 2023? And related to that, do you have any mitigation strategies to offset the impact, for example, potentially adjusting prices?\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. I will answer the first part of the question. I am sure Al will have more to add on the second part. Obviously, we have to wait and see the pace at which the second network is enabled on cards on e-commerce transactions. Our current expectation, given that our fiscal year, as you know, goes through September is that the effect in 2023 will be minimal, if any. But we will keep you posted. More broadly, just in terms of our views about the impact longer term, people come to us because of the value we create and that value comes in the form of having a dual message network and everything that goes with it, the security and the reliability we offer that is unmatched, as well as the dispute resolution and other sets of services, tokenization, all our risk management services that we layer on. We have competed for business in the past and merchants have chosen us based on the value we provide, and I am sure, Al, you have more to add on this front.\nAl Kelly: Yeah. I think that our capabilities are just terrific and in an e-commerce world, David, the liability for fraud sits with the merchant. So they are going to be very, very careful about who they do business with and they have done business with us for years and know that we have very, very strong risk capabilities, very, very strong fraud prevention capabilities. And those are the types of things that in our experience since Durbin in 2010 that have a good amount of merchants who solely stick with us, they never route to the unaffiliated network because of those security and fraud capabilities we have, plus as Vasant alluded to the fact that we have the ability to be dual message, which makes a big difference in car rental, hotel. And in the online world, we will make a big difference when people order multiple items from a merchant. It will allow the merchant to ship in different shipments as opposed to waiting until all the products are gathered and they can ship it and they are forced to ship at onetime if you are using a single messaging capability. So I think we have a lot of history and a lot of important capability differences and a lot of our merchants in the United States are very familiar with the strengths that they get from doing business with us.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: And our next question is from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Hey, guys. Thanks. Your outlook and your budget you gave us was obviously helpful and I clearly underscores the resilient of the consumer so far. But just to touch on the water for a minute. And I think you have about a third of your revenues now coming from new flows, services, many of which had are early stages of growth. So putting that together with higher inflation, Al, would you expect any type of difference and set of outcomes on the topline if we were to see a notable downturn? And then, Vasant, just maybe you could touch on the flexibility you think you have on the expense side to help manage through any type of change?\nAl Kelly: So, Darrin, just to be clear, your one-third is about right for that [ph] plus new flows, not just\u2026\nDarrin Peller: Right.\nAl Kelly: Not just new flows.\nDarrin Peller: Yeah.\nAl Kelly: As you alluded to, I mean, right now, we are seeing nothing but stability and it\u2019s been true over the last numbers of quarters. And our business is very different than it was the last time there was a downturn. We are much more into everyday spend categories. E-commerce has evolved tremendously. There\u2019s been a lot more cash digitization. We have a very heavy debit portfolio, which tends to perform better during these downturns. And frankly, I don\u2019t think any of us know what the impact is going to be coming off of the pandemic where there still seems to be a lot of pent-up demand for travel, for example, which is a highly discretionary purchase and we are in an unusual time where employment has really held up. So we will certainly watch if payment volumes are impacted in any kind of significant way. Back to the core of your question, obviously, we will have some hit on our revenue line, but we will continue to manage on the expense side and I will let Vasant take that half of the question.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. I mean and continuing on revenue for a minute, I mean, clearly, we now have new flows and value-added services, which are businesses, which are in new use cases that are very different than we have had in past times when we had recessions. So and they are also ramping in many cases and value-added services clearly is a whole range of new services that are not necessarily all tied to economic ups and downs. So clearly, there\u2019s a lot of differences from the past. But as Al said, recessions can come in all forms and shapes and sizes, and they could be global or regional. They could be deep or shallow. They could be recessions that have lesser impact on consumer spending and so on. As it relates to expenses, as I said in my comments on planning assumptions, I\u2019d say three things. One, we are moderating expense growth as we go into the year. So expense growth is clearly coming down from the levels you have seen. For the year, our going-in planning assumption is nominal growth of about 9%. But I would just note that in the second half of the year -- the fiscal year, the growth is actually at the high end of mid-single digits. So it is moderating through the year and we don\u2019t know when there will be a recession or if there will be a recession. But if you look at what all the various prognosticators are saying, it appears that most people think if there\u2019s going to be a recession, it\u2019s sometime next year, probably, six months from now. Now that would put us in the second half of our fiscal year. So we already have expense growth moderating to the sort of the high end of mid-single digits. Clearly, we will look to reprioritize, scale back, postpone, et cetera. And depending on the nature of the recession and the impact it\u2019s having on our revenue, we would seek to manage our expenses to be even better than what our planning assumptions might be and bring the rate -- growth rate down. So we will calibrate as we go along.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. You may go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Appreciate it. Al, I was wondering maybe just if you could give some thoughts on what are you most excited about as we head into 2023 and 2024, and what has surprised you and -- if anything? And Vasant, can you give us a little bit of color on goods versus services, have you seen the -- what the trend on growth rates have you seen on those two items?\nAl Kelly: So in terms of what we are excited about, look, I think in all three businesses, we are seeing some really terrific green shoots and in the consumer payments, certainly excited about the realities of cash digitization getting more and more pronounced around the world. We are certainly excited about the continued progress we are seeing in Tap to Pay. The fact that our business in e-commerce has grown so much, really like what we are seeing in the continent in Europe in terms of the growth that we are seeing there, which is really strong. If we look at India, Brazil, Germany, Canada, Japan, all are growing at very, very good levels. There\u2019s very different dynamics in each of those markets, but they are all growing very well. I just recently took a trip to Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Africa is a place that\u2019s not going to help us in 2023 or 2024 necessarily, Bob. But the last -- we now have offices, I think, in 13 countries there in the last five or six offices we have opened there, opened around the world in Africa. In new flows, as we have organized that business as a single business, Oliver Jenkyn is bringing a great focus to it and making sure that we are driving new use cases around the globe, getting more and more enablers who help us drive those use cases and we are putting a particular focus there on B2 -- cross-border where previously, a lot of the early transact \u2013 early use cases in new flows have been in the area of things like domestic like P2P and B2B. And then in VAS [ph], certainly, we are excited about the two recent acquisitions we made of Tink and Currencycloud. I think they are both going to bring some very interesting and good capabilities to us. And we are -- in both cases, we have spent a lot of time and planning sessions between the folks who are running those businesses and our folks, and I think, there\u2019s a great opportunity ahead. Vasant, do you want to tackle the goods versus services question?\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. A few things on goods versus services, as you know, we tend to look at how various segments are performing versus the pre-pandemic level in 2019. It\u2019s a clean way to look at things. And while there\u2019s been a lot of talk about how goods are underperforming, most of the goods categories index for 2019 actually have done quite well and they are holding quite stable. What it means is that they grew a lot faster in the early parts of the recovery and then haven\u2019t grown as fast as people shifted from goods to services. But overall, if you compare to 2019, the goods business has done very well, indexing very well to where it was and very much either on or above the pre-COVID trend line. More recently, even as services and restaurants, travel, entertainment, have continued to grow, we are starting to see goods do better. So they went through a period where they had very high growth, especially through the stimulus period and so on, recovered much faster than services, then services to come back. We are starting to see some recovery on the goods side, too now. But overall, goods is doing quite well on a three-year index, too.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Harshita Rawat. You may go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Thank you for taking my question. Vasant, can you talk about actually [ph] on cross-border revenues in 2023? I know there\u2019s still recovery to be had if you just look at, like, trend line on travel versus 2019 and also if you look at, like, metrics beyond spend, which is inflation in that. But on the flip side, this has very high beta to macro. U.S. dollar has strengthened a lot, which can impact cross-border inflows into the U.S. and FX volatility was a big benefit in revenue this year, but you are kind of against kind of tough comps next year. So lots of moving pieces, can you -- how are you thinking about it? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. Clearly, lots of moving pieces, as you pointed out. So I will just go through them one by one. Yes, we did benefit from very high currency volatility in the second half of this year and that does help us, as you know. It\u2019s in our international fees line, international revenue line and what volatility is going to be is anybody\u2019s guess. For planning purposes, we assume that it starts to moderate through the year. It\u2019s still high and we are assuming that it will be maybe higher than normal in the first quarter and then moderates as we go through the year to what we have seen in the past to levels that are normal over a long period of time. So that\u2019s the impact of volatility. As it relates to the dollar and its impact on cross-border travel, we have told you that we have seen about a 2-point monthly improvement in that index in the last few months. And again, I mean, it\u2019s very hard to predict these things. You know we got it wrong last year. The recovery was a hell of a lot faster than we expected. We will probably get it wrong again, but we have been very clear about our assumption, which is that the recovery we have seen for the past several months, we think is probably the new rate of recovery. There will be accelerations and decelerations and maybe if China opens up and lift restrictions, there could be some acceleration. So that\u2019s sort of what we are assuming for travel. What impact of recession might have on it remains to be seen. As Al say, there\u2019s pent-up demand and how much will that offset it, we will wait and see. The main message is there\u2019s still recovery in cross-border happening, but we are also lapping much stronger cross-border levels from last year. As you know, cross-border travel really started to recover last September and so we are now beginning to lap some really stronger periods last quarter. So the rate of growth inevitably has slowed, and it will continue to slow through the year, but it\u2019s still above the long-term trend line, because we still are in recovery mode. So, hopefully, that helps a bit.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. You may go ahead.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. From a headline perspective, I guess, if you are seeing nothing but stability that has been the situation for a few months, as you mentioned, are there things to highlight on a more granular basis if there are particular areas of strength or weakness? So that\u2019s part one. But then it also seems that you are implying that the business as a whole is more resilient, because you have new flows and value-added services in addition to consumer pay and kind of agree with that. But could you maybe talk about the new flows and value-added, what you might see in a downturn?\nAl Kelly: First of all, Ashwin, we -- I\u2019d say, we have seen stable for more than a few months, but probably pretty close to the last 12 months, certainly in the last nine months. Look, there\u2019s -- as I said, while there\u2019s stability, the reality is we do know that there\u2019s some changes in consumer behavior going on, but they are still spending the same amount of money and they are still paying in the same way, which are critical to us. So we know there\u2019s some substitution going on, where people are buying generics versus buying brands. We know that people are spending a certain amount on that\u2019s -- an increased amount on food and drug products, and that\u2019s causing them to have less money available for discretionary spending. But and we are still seeing -- as I highlighted, I think, last quarter, the affluent customer is still jumping back in the market and that\u2019s a very, very good thing because of the amount of spend they do and we are still seeing employment levels at a very healthy level. So we know this stuff that is going on, but the reality is that all consumers might be altering a bit what they buy in different categories. The realities are that -- as I said, they are still spending the same amount of money and using the same ways to pay as they did before. In terms of value-added services and new flows, obviously, value-added services is somewhat dependent on transactions. So we provide additional value on transactions. If those were transactions were to go down, that obviously impacts the value-added services business. The net flows business really took a bit of a hit, because of the amount of business that we had in Russia. But as I reported it, it was up 42% in the fourth quarter, excluding Russia, which was up 7 points in the third quarter. So the momentum is very, very good there. And I think that, that has a lot to do with the fact that over the last 15 months, we have done a really good job of further diversifying that business in terms of use cases, enablers and geographies and all of that\u2019s helped us a lot.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I want to talk about the Visa Direct decision. So by businesses, platforms, governments that are deciding to use Visa Direct relative to other alternatives like RTP systems around the world. And I fully appreciate that Visa Direct leverages, many of these RTP and other ACH systems around the world, but what is it that is causing them to choose Visa Direct? And as a follow-up, you have often talked about the pricing for Visa Direct, it\u2019s very use case-based. Maybe you could just give directional examples of what a higher priced use case might be and what a lower price use case might be?\nAl Kelly: On the -- let me first tackle the -- why Visa Direct. First of all, Visa Direct biggest advantage is that it uses the VisaNet platform, and therefore, comes along with all the capabilities of the VisaNet platform. Second, we have incredible reach with Visa Direct, as I talked about, almost 7 billion endpoints, including accounts cards and wallets. And as you alluded to, we have become a bit agnostic of exactly how that flow happens, if the first or last mile is on an RTP network or an ACH network or a payment gateway, that\u2019s fine by us. And we are continuing to invest in capabilities as it relates to Visa Direct, and then you get a lot of the protections that you get 0 liability, charge-backs, dispute manage -- good solid dispute management, the fact that you get the security and the monies that we spend on protecting consumer data, as well as battling cyber security. And all of those capabilities offer an awful lot of peace of mind to a consumer versus a transaction where the money is immediately moved from your bank account across an RTP network to pay somebody. And all of a sudden, if there\u2019s an issue, there\u2019s nobody to turn to. There\u2019s no rules governing what happens. There\u2019s nobody to help mediate what\u2019s happening. All those things are things that our network does that makes Visa Direct a really, really strong alternative to an RTP network.\nVasant Prabhu: In regarding to your second question, maybe we will give you two examples. At one end is a high value use case and that will be cross-border remittances. The use of Visa Direct gives you extraordinary flexibility. You can do it account-to-account, account-to-account, account-to-account, sitting at home, you don\u2019t have to go to someone to give them cash. It\u2019s also tremendous flexibility at the other end in terms of how someone receives the money. It\u2019s real time. It has all the other benefits Al mentioned. As you know, cross-border remittances have a very high cost right now. We can do all that for a lot less and still have a yield that is quite attractive relative to our traditional yield. At the other end of the spectrum, P2P, very much a preferred way to do it is to have your debit credentials in there, because it makes it a lot more secure and has all the value we can add. It\u2019s a high volume but lower yielding use case and very often it\u2019s the way we get going in most markets. So those are two examples, and in between, you have insurance disbursements, earn wage access, marketplace payouts and so on, all of which are different.\nJennifer Como: Last question please, Holly.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang. You may go ahead. With JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you. Thank you so much. I know you have gone beyond the hour. Thanks for the time. Just two quick ones, if you don\u2019t mind. Just on the other revenue line. I know services, you had mentioned there is some transactional element to it, but you did 20% growth at scale in fiscal 2022. So any thoughts on how 2023 might come together, assuming relative stability? And then I just wanted to clarify the base case on operating leverage, it looks like on a nominal basis, we should assume minimal operating leverage. I just want to make sure we are hearing that correctly and how that might flex if things change? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. On operating leverage, as we said, we are trying to balance the short-term and the long-term. As you have heard, we think there are extraordinary opportunities in new flows and value-added services. These are long-cycle businesses. You have to invest now for the future. So, yes, we are choosing to invest in the business and that reflects the expenses that we plan -- our expense growth plan relative to the revenue growth. And the other part of the question was other revenues\u2026\nTien-Tsin Huang: Other revenue.\nVasant Prabhu: Right. On other revenues, yeah, there are some things there that will also have some sequential slowdown, because there are things like car-related benefits and so on in the other revenue line that are linked to travel. And as you lap a stronger recovery of travel from last year, there will be some sequential slowdown. There are also a few other value-added services there. So just like the overall business where there is a sequential slowdown because of the lapping effects and some currency impacts in Russia and so on, you will see that in the other revenue line, too.\nJennifer Como: Great. And with that, we would like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our Investor Relations team.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Before I talk about the quarter, I wanted to acknowledge the passing of Dee Hock, Visa's Founder and Chief Executive Officer Emeritus. The whole Visa family deeply mourns the loss of a true visionary and a great man. Even with several global and macro events from the war in Ukraine to inflation, to concerns over a broader recession, Visa's business model has proven to be very resilient, with strong financial performance. Net revenues grew 19% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.98, up 33%. Total Q3 payment volume was 136% versus three years ago, up 1 point from Q2. In the U.S., payments volume index to 2019 was 146% in the quarter. U.S. debit volumes were 155% and credit 138% of 2019, both up modestly from Q2. Card-not-present, excluding travel volumes in the U.S., remained significantly ahead of prepandemic levels at 170% of 2019, consistent with Q2. International volume was 120% of 2019, down 1 point from Q2. Excluding China and Russia, it was 146% of 2019, up 6 points. Q3 Cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, were 123% versus three years ago, up 11 points from Q2, and this includes Russia in prior period numbers. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 22 points from 82% of 2019 in Q2 to 104% in Q3, as we continue to see strong recovery in consumer and commercial travel. Process transactions were 139% versus 2019, 1 point above Q2. Credentials increased 8% year-over-year and are up 11%, excluding Russia. Before I dive into the client wins and progress towards our strategy, I wanted to take a moment to discuss two topics: recession and inflation. On the first, we're not economic forecasters, so I'm not going to predict the future or a potential likelihood of a recession. Instead, let's focus on the facts. From the numbers I just reviewed relative to 2019 levels, growth has been stable or improving in overall domestic payment volume, credit, debit, card present and card-not-present volume. And this indicates the most of 2022 with no indication of any slowdown, including in more recent weeks. In cross-border, of course, the recovery has continued to strengthen, while growth has been stable in aggregate, there are big shifts under the surface that continue to demonstrate the momentum of the recovery. First, from goods to services. Early in the pandemic, goods surpassed services. We were seeing the historic trend. Even as services have rebounded in the last six months, the percentage spending on goods in our payments volumes still remained high, higher than the pre-pandemic levels. For example, while U.S. home improvement and retail good spending during the third quarter grew only low single-digit year-over-year, it remains well ahead of pre-pandemic trendline. Second, many discussionary segments have further strengthened. If you look at U.S. travel spend, it is not backed to the pre-COVID trendline, but grew more than 40% versus last year. Third, the affluent spend continue to recover, particularly in the areas of restaurants, travel and entertainment. At the same time, non-affluent spend remained relatively resilient. We mentioned the affluent spend returning to restaurants last quarter. That trend continued this quarter with affluent restaurant spend indexing in the 160% to 180% range versus 2019. Similarly, in Europe in the last six months, luxury hotel payments volume and average ticket size outpaced growth in the overall hotel category versus 2019. At the same time, budget and mid-priced hotels saw modest improvements. Based on our numbers, we haven't seen any evidence of consumer pulling back spending in our markets. Now, a few words on inflation. It's just too early to draw any definitive conclusions. A few observations though on inflation. One, keep in mind that the headline CPI inflation number does not necessarily apply to Visa as our basket of goods isn't the same. Consumers just don't buy homes or use cards with their Visa cards, for example. So, we see a several point gap between headline inflation and inflation in card-related spend categories. Two, thus far, U.S. transaction growth relative to 2019 is strong and stable. Ticket sizes remain around 15 points above 2019 levels as they had for much of the pandemic due to several factors. Three, historically, in the U.S., we have seen PCE growth, which is the most important metric that drives our growth, remains strong even during inflationary periods. That said, lastly, excessive and long-term inflation is not good for consumers or the overall economy. Looking ahead, we'll continue to monitor the potential impact of inflation to ticket sizes, transaction counts, as well as volumes across spend categories. With all of that as backdrop, I'll now provide an update on progress with clients. Traditional issuers remain a key component of our consumer payments growth. And this quarter, we had several important partnership renewals globally. First, in China, we renewed our partnership with ICBC, the largest bank in the world, in terms of assets and the biggest credit card issuer in China in terms of the number of cards. In Japan, we renewed one of the country's largest credit issuers, Credit Saison, and expanded our issuing relationship with Toyota Finance. In Australia, we extended our credit and debit issuing agreements with NAV and CDA, two of the largest banks in the country. And in the U.S., we recently renewed our relationship with Green Dot, a top 20 issuer in debit and a top 10 issuer in prepaid. Fintechs are also key to our consumer payments growth. In Europe alone, we have more than 100 fintech programs that continue to deepen our relationship with these partners. Revolut is a great example. They already utilized a number of our capabilities, including Visa Direct and Currencycloud, and we just renewed our global issuing partnership. They also recently selected Tink for payment initiation services, which will allow users across Europe to seamlessly move money into their Revolut accounts. In many countries, the mobile operators are particularly important partners. We previously mentioned our partnerships with M-Pesa Africa and Safaricom, and I'm happy to report that we have begun issuance with these partners who are part of the Vodacom Group that cover 130 million customers in Sub-Saharan Africa. In a similar light, we also recently signed partnerships to issue Visa credentials, and in some cases, also enable Visa Direct with other mobile operators around the world. Mobily in Saudi Arabia with 10 million customers, Ooredoo in Qatar with around 2 million customers, Azercell in Azerbaijan with 5 million customers, and Orange Egypt with 27 million customers. I now want to dive a little deeper on two important markets, Brazil and India. Starting in Brazil, over the past two years, we have grown our business through issuing agreements with Ita\u00fa, Mercado, Pago, Pataday and Caixa, with a 70% increase in credentials. In addition to traditional credit card issuance partners like Banco do Brasil have been growing their credit base by utilizing Visa's digital acquisition platform that allows them to instantly issue cards in a digital environment. Further, our fintech partners in Brazil, including Banco XP and Neon Pagamentos, have issued more than 20 million credentials over the past two years. On the acceptance side, we've doubled acceptance points since 2020, reaching more than 10 million merchant locations in Brazil. The results of our efforts over the past 8 to 10 quarters is evident in Brazil's payment volume, which in the third quarter was more than 200% of 2019, with e-commerce nearing 300%. In India, our efforts over the last few years are paying off and Q3 payments volume was 184% of 2019, with e-commerce above 300%. Building on that momentum, we had co-brand wins with two of the largest multibillion-dollar revenue Indian conglomerates that collectively represent millions of potential credentials. One with TataNeu, a super app for e-commerce financial services and loyalty programs across the Tata Group; two, with Aditya Birla Finance and SBI Cards, provide rewards for spending across all of their group companies. We also signed a co-brand with IndiGo, India's largest airline by number of passengers. And let me briefly touch on the US, where there's still great opportunity for cash digitization. We're excited about Tap to Pay, which has now reached 24% of face-to-face transactions in Q3. We're seeing positive trends in terms of additional spend and transaction lift in the US. In 2021, the average contactless active debit cardholder had two more transactions and $65 in additional spend each month. We expect this trend to continue, driving incremental payment volumes and transactions for contactless card issuers through faster, simpler POS experiences. Now moving to new flows, which in Q3 had over 20% revenue growth. In B2B, our Q3 commercial payments volume was 145% of 2019, up 6 points from Q2, driven by the return of travel. Q3 was the first quarter in which spend on business travel surpassed 2019 levels. This quarter, we're excited to have reached a significant multiyear agreement with WEX to enable their travel, health and corporate clients to make payments using Visa virtual card capabilities. WES is a global leader in financial technology solutions for commercial payments, and we are proud to partner with them. In the fleet space, we reached an agreement with M-PESA, a fintech based out of Kenya. Their fleet and expense management digital platform will address the problem of paying cash in the African trucking business through Visa prepaid reloadable credentials. Visa Direct is a powerful capability for many of our new flows. In this quarter, transactions grew 35%, excluding Russia.  On the remittance side, Western Union has enabled Visa Direct for their US customers to send money to select countries globally, expanding upon their initial rollout across Europe in 2021. We also expanded our agreement with Remitly, one of the world's premier digital service remittance companies to offer Visa Direct cross-border payments originating from Canada to bank accounts globally.  Another Visa Direct P2P expansion is with LINE Pay in Japan. Already a large wallet issuer, 6 million Visa credentials, LINE Pay is now enabling Visa Direct for cross-border and domestic use cases such as remittances and cash outs. On wage disbursement, GrubHub, a leading food ordering and delivery marketplace available in over 4,000 US cities, will enable drivers to quickly send their earnings to their eligible debit cards using Visa Direct. We are excited for them to join our other food delivery platforms, including DoorDash and SkipTheDishes. We also reached an agreement with the US tip enabler, TipSend [ph] to enable millions of tips disbursements to be pushed to employees' accounts through eligible debit cards at thousands of restaurant locations they serve. For TipSend, 90% of tips in the United States are still dispersed with cash today. In Canada, we reached an agreement with a large fintech, Wealthsimple, for accounts funds in and funds out for their over 2 million clients. Finally, enablers are key to our success in Visa Direct, and we recently signed a deal with Finastra, one of the world's largest financial services software companies and open banking platforms with 8,600 customers and serving 90 of the world's top 100 banks. Together, we will offer Finastra's clients access to cross-border business, the small business at B2C payouts to eligible accounts in multiple currencies and countries.  While the US was one of our first markets to achieve scale for Visa Direct, we have many other countries and regions that are growing and scaling. For example, in Latin America, third quarter transactions quadrupled versus last year. We have over 20 domestic and cross-border P2P programs commercially launched or in pilot, such as PLIN and Yape in Peru, WhatsApp in Brazil and Cash across Central America, in addition to many other programs for other use cases.  Now let me move to value-added services, which had Q3 revenue growth of almost 20%. Evaluated services grow through new and existing clients, existing services, expanding geographically and adding new services both organically and through acquisitions. Today, I'll provide an update on recent wins with some of our acquired entities. First, one of our earlier acquisitions, CyberSource, recently added NCR and Global Payments as partners, both intend to offer CyberSource capabilities to their merchant clients. This is an important strategy as our merchant base utilizing CyberSource through acquirers is growing payments volume twice as fast as the rest of our CyberSource business. Cardinal Commerce, our network-agnostic authentication capability, has grown transactions 30% globally year-to-date, with more than double that in Europe, where the secure customer authentication requirement has driven faster adoption of 3D Secure. VERIFI, our network agnostic dispute resolution solution, recently extended its agreement with PNC for VERIFI's cardholder dispute resolution network product. YellowPepper, the network agnostic connectivity platform, just signed Vex [ph], the Brazilian bank that offers its $50 million corporate and individual clients worldwide trade, e-commerce, staff solutions and most recently an FX API platform. Vex will use YellowPepper's payment initiation services to enable cross-border money movement starting with Visa Direct to send payouts to eligible cards. I mentioned Tink's recent win earlier. Our other acquisition from this fiscal year, Currencycloud, has signed more than 100 Fintech clients since December to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments. And finally, the tokenization capabilities we acquired now called Token ID have been selected by several partners. First, Global Payments will use Visa's Token ID as their strategic go-forward solution for multiple EMV network tokenization services to reduce card-not-present fraud and realize operational efficiencies for their clients. Second, the Clearinghouse, the first US real-time payment network in one of two US ACH networks, chose Visa's Token ID solution to power the secure token exchange. This industry-first account tokenization solution in the United States is utilizing Visa's Token ID payment account tokenization technology to replace sensitive customer account data with unique tokens and reduce the amount of exposed payment data. Our internally developed value-added services are just as important. One very compelling solution is from Visa consulting and analytics. Together with FIS, we recently launched a risk-as-a-service solution powered by data and risk experts. Key components of progress over the past 12 months include our real-time monitoring through our AI-enabled platform has blocked over $2 billion in fraudulent payments volume. Our analysis of potential fraud for a proactive testing identified a $15 million exposure to clients. Our capabilities to proactively detect and mitigate cyber criminals attempts to inject payment skimming malware onto online merchant checkout pages has prevented over $10 million in e-commerce-related losses. And our ability to detect terminal cloning has successfully blocked $3 million in fraud from attempted downloads. In sum, we had a very strong quarter and our results showed it. We made progress continuing to build relationships and solutions across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services that will fuel future growth around the globe. We remain vigilant in monitoring the trends in our business and the economy and confident on our strategy as we enable the movement of money globally. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon everyone. Our fiscal third quarter results reflected continued strength in domestic spend and a robust recovery in travel with net revenues up 19% and GAAP EPS up 36%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 33%. The ever strengthening dollar dragged down reported net revenue growth by almost three points and non-GAAP EPS growth by nearly three and a half points. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was over 21%, and non-GAAP EPS growth was 36%. Adjusting for Russia, constant dollar net revenue growth was 26%. A few key highlights. Global payments volume growth has remained strong and stable relative to pre-COVID levels. In constant dollars, the US index was 2 points higher than the second quarter, up 46% versus 2019. The international index, ex-China and Russia, was up 6 points from the second quarter, also 46% above 2019. The robust cross-border travel recovery continued. Index to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, jumped from 94 in March to 112 in June. This was helped by much of Asia opening up at the beginning of the quarter. The US inbound corridor picking up steam, as well as strong growth in and out of Europe, as we head into the peak summer travel season. Our three growth engines, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues around 20%. During the quarter, we bought back almost $2.5 billion in stock at an average price of $202.16. We also added $600 million to the MDL litigation escrow account. This had the same effect as a stock buyback at $200.25. We issued EUR 3 billion in debt, with maturities ranging from 4 to 12 years. We obtained attractive coupons on our inaugural eurobond issuance, ranging from 1.5% to 2.375%, well below rates achievable on the equivalent dollar-denominated debt. We have now prefunded debt maturities coming up in September and December. Finally, as a reminder, we suspended operations in Russia late in the second quarter. As such, there are no volumes, transactions or revenues from Russia in our third quarter numbers. Any comparisons to prior periods include Russia, unless otherwise noted. Now on to the details. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 36% above 2019. Excluding China and Russia, total payments volume growth was 17% and 46% higher than 2019. In the US, credit grew 21% and improved 3 points to 38% over 2019, helped by travel and fuel spend. Debit grew 4% year-over-year, lapping the big spike from the stimulus last year. Relative to 2019, debit was up 55%, sustaining significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. Debit has benefited from accelerated cash digitization through the pandemic. US card present spend grew 13% and was 27% above 2019, up 6 points. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 7% and was 70% higher than 2019. Relative to three years ago, e-commerce levels remain well above the pre-COVID trend line, even as card-present spend continues to recover. International constant dollar payments volumes, excluding China and Russia, grew 24% and was 46% above 2019. A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 40% year-over-year and 107% higher than 2019, with robust performance across the region fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 34% year-over-year and 102% higher than 2019, led by client wins and cash digitalization. Europe was up 17% year-over-year and 37% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion underway in the UK, ex-UK, Europe was 66% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Excluding migrations, UK payment volumes have been stable in the third quarter, while Germany improved more than 15 points from the second quarter. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region but has improved significantly from the second quarter, up 24% year-over-year and 30% above 2019, up five points in the second quarter. Across Asia, most borders are open and domestic restrictions lifted. Only China remains mostly closed off, and Japan is gradually normalizing. Global process transactions were up 16% year-over-year and 39% over 2019 levels. Since we did not process domestic transactions in Russia, our reported process transactions are not materially impacted by the suspension of Russia operations. Now on to cross-border. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe were up 48% year-over-year and 23% over 2019. Cross-border card not present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 4% year-over-year and 62% above 2019. Cross-border travel related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 129% year-over-year and exceeded pre-COVID levels for the first time, indexing at 104 of 2019. The cross-border travel index went from the low 90s in March and April to 108% in May and 112% in June. We continue to see a rapid ramp-up in travel as soon as borders reopen or restrictions are lifted. A few highlights. Canada removed testing requirements for vaccinated travelers in April. Travel inbound to the US jumped 16 points in the third quarter to 86% of 2019 levels, helped by Canada, Europe and Asia. The lifting of testing requirements in June will hopefully help sustain the recovery of travel into the US. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean has been very strong through the COVID years, especially to Mexico. With more countries, including Costa Rica and Jamaica, lifting COVID protocols in April, inbound travel to the region climbed nearly 20 points in the third quarter to 50% of our 2019 levels. European Union member states removed previous testing and vaccination requirements for non-European citizens in April and May, resulting in travel to Europe recovering a sizable 30 points in the third quarter with more than half of that from North America. Inbound travel to Europe was 21% about 2019. Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, CEMEA region, outbound travel increased six points in the third quarter despite the loss of Russia, driven by Ukraine and travel for religious holidays from the Middle East and was 13% above 2019. In Asia, borders continue to open and travel restrictions eased for international travelers, resulting in inbound travel recovering 22 points in the third quarter to 58% of 2019 levels. Japan opened to tourists and increased the entry limit from 10,000 to 20,000 people per day. Australia dropped pre-arrival testing requirements in April. Several countries, including Malaysia and Vietnam, dropped testing requirements in May. The pace of travel recovery to and from Asia will be a key driver of the future trajectory of cross-border travel. Most Asian borders are now open, except for Mainland China and some restrictions in Taiwan and Japan. In the third quarter, travel into China indexed below 25% of 2019 and outbound from China below 40%. Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 13%, slower than the 14% nominal growth in Q2 payments volume. Reported Q2 payments volumes include Russia, whereas revenues in Q3 do not since we recognized second quarter service revenues for Russia before we suspended operations last year -- last quarter. Data processing revenues grew 8%, below the 16% process transaction growth. Revenue growth lags transaction growth, primarily due to the suspension of Russia operations. As I mentioned earlier, Russia domestic transactions were not included in our reported process transactions, and as such, the loss of Russia does not materially impact transactions growth. However, we did have data processing revenue from Russia transactions in prior periods, which we do not anymore. This negatively impacted data processing revenue growth by over four points. There was also about a two-plus point exchange rate drag. International transaction revenues were up 51% versus the 38% increase in nominal cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and select pricing actions. Other revenues grew 26%, led by consulting services and travel benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines, each growing around 20%. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by carded B2B recovery. Commercial or B2B volumes grew 27% year-over-year and are up 45% versus 2019. Growth was driven, in part, by increased travel and was broad-based globally across small and large businesses. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 35% due to strong growth outside the US. Value-added services growth was led by consulting services as well as risk and identity solutions. Revenue growth drivers include higher volumes from existing clients, greater clients and attrition and select pricing actions. Client incentives were 26.1% of gross revenues below our expectations. This was primarily driven by the faster-than-expected recovery of higher-yielding cross-border volumes, which improved revenue mix. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. Exchange rates were an approximately 3-point drag on reported revenue growth. The suspension of Russia operations reduced revenues by approximately 5 points. GAAP operating expenses grew 51%, inclusive of a $716 million provision associated with the interchange multi-restrict litigation. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 15%. The inclusion of Currencycloud and Tink added about 3 points. The suspension of Russia operations reduced expenses by about 3 points. Exchange rates were about a 2-point benefit. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $246 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $73 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 13.3%. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates benefited by 6 points from the resolution of certain US state and foreign tax matters related primarily through prior years.  Our recurring tax rate remains in the 19% to 19. 5% range. GAAP EPS was $1.60. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.98, up 33% over last year, inclusive of nearly 3.5 point drag from the stronger dollar. With a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buybacks, we returned $3.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Through the first three weeks of July, business trends have remained strong and stable.  On a year-over-year basis, US payments volume was up 12% with debit up 6% and credit up 18%. US spend growth versus 2019 was up 46% with debit up 55% and credit up 38%. These trends are consistent with the third quarter and with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 14% year-over-year, up 40% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 60% year-over-year and 29% over 2019. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 57% above 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 16% above 2019. Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. As Al indicated, we're seeing no evidence of a pullback in consumer spending. US payments volumes have indexed in the mid-140 range versus 2019 since January through July 21. Excluding Russia and China, international payments volumes have also indexed about 140 since January. Process transactions have been stable at around 140 versus 2019. As such, we are assuming that the trends we have seen in payments volume and processed transactions will continue through the fourth quarter. We will, of course, stay vigilant and on the lookout for any changes caused by rising interest rates, high inflation and declining consumer confidence. Through July, the cross-border recovery has progressed faster and further than we had expected last October. For the fourth quarter, we're assuming stable growth versus 2019 in cross-border e-commerce and some improvement from travel in and out of Europe and into the US, especially from Asia. The next and perhaps the last leg of the cross-border travel recovery will have to await a full reopening in China, which we do not expect in the near future.  With these assumptions, fourth quarter net revenues could grow at the high teens to 20% range in constant dollars. This includes Tink and Currencycloud, which add approximately 0.5 point to net revenues, and the suspension of operations in Russia, which subtracts approximately 5 points.  The dollar has continued to strengthen, significantly increasing the exchange rate drag, which we expect will reduce reported net revenue growth by 4 to 5 points. Q4 client incentives are expected to range between 26% and 27% of gross revenues, driven primarily by anticipated strong volume performance across all regions. For the year, we now expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the middle of the 25.5% to 26.5% range. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in constant dollars to grow at the low end or high teens. This includes 2 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink, offset by 3 points from reduced costs due to Russia. Personnel costs will be higher since we are granting annual salary increases a quarter earlier than normal to all employees below the SVP level. This will add three points to Q4 operating expense growth. Exchange rates could reduce reported operating expense growth by about two points. Our tax rate is expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range. While there's uncertainty, consumer spending remains strong. Growth has been stable across payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions globally. We have demonstrated our ability to adjust to different environments and are prepared to do so again if warranted. We will stay vigilant, flexible and agile. We are fortunate to have a resilient business with great momentum and extraordinary longer term growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\nJennifer Como: Thanks Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I know we're indexing well below where we normally would be if the pandemic didn't occur for cross-border travel. However, I guess there's a fear that we're seeing the strength partly because it's pent-up demand and then inflation. Could you help us think about how you feel about the risks associated with the drop-off in cross-border? And then Vasant, you talked about Asia being the key. How much more strength can we see out of the non-China region? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: So, I'll start, Sanjay. I actually think cross-border travel has come back very, very strongly and quicker than what we thought and that still with as you suggested, Asia being quite low. You heard the numbers, both inbound and outbound, in Vasant's remarks. Plus inbound to the U.S., somewhat up until recently because of the COVID -- required COVID test and now the strength of the U.S. dollar still has upside as well. So, yes, for sure, there is some element of pent-up demand, but I think that, that demand is going to remain strong for some time. And I don't see people being deterred even by higher cost of airline tickets that people are experiencing. If anything, probably the experiential element of waiting in airports for a longer period of time because of understaffing that exists in a number of places around the world is probably the thing that weighs more on my mind, but I expect that to normalize at some point here soon. Vasant, do you want to add anything?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Clearly, I mean, there's a variety of factors at play here. First, there has been a general shift in consumer preferences. You've heard this from other people, to move away from goods to experiences, and travel is very much a beneficiary of that. It's not just cross-border travel. As Al said in his remarks, it's all travel, including domestic travel. So, it's a pretty broad-based desire to travel. The second is people are keen to travel. So, as soon as restrictions are lifted, you see the reactions right away. In terms of where the strength is, clearly, the recovery in Asia has been quite strong. You saw how much it improved this quarter, almost 20 points, if I remember right. And it is continuing. It's happening all across Asia, except for places like China, and they're still -- it's not that easy to get in and out of Japan and Taiwan. But elsewhere, it's very strong across Asia. There's a huge amount of interest in traveling to Europe and significant interest in European traveling out of Europe. So Europe has been also recovering very fast and is indexing at pretty high levels relative to pre-COVID volumes. The other area that continues to surprise is Latin America. We told you that it was always quite high, because Latin America stayed fairly open. But in the last quarter it jumped another 20 points and is indexing in the 150 range for people traveling into Latin America. So as you look across it, this looks pretty durable. There's still recovery left to come, as you can see. Asia still was indexing well below 2019 levels. The U.S. is still below 2019 levels. So we don\u2019t think this ends anytime soon.\nJennifer Como: Great. Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Al, you had a number of callouts in the prepared remarks related to Visa Direct. I was hoping to get your perspective on the news that the CFPB is investigating the levels of fraud in Zelle and other domestic P2P services. Can you just comment a bit or give us a little bit of color on how the fraud protections associated with Visa Direct are different or similar to those services and sort of how that type of investigation might impact Visa Direct's role in P2P over the long-term? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Well, thanks, Lisa. One of the terrific things about Visa Direct is that, it isn't running on a different new platform. It runs on VisaNet and, therefore, has the ability to utilize all of the same capabilities that we have on VisaNet, including those related to KYC and those related to fraud prevention. So, certainly, this is something that we're well aware of and we'll continue to watch closely. I do think that consumers value this P2P capability in very, very big ways, not just in the United States, but around the world, and I certainly expect it to be a use case that continues to grow around the world, and we'll just have to make sure that we're working closely with Zelle and other partners to make sure that we're contributing as much as we can to make sure that, that service is secure as can be, because as you know, trust is a basic underpinning of money movement in every single use case around the world.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hey, guys. Thanks. I really want to touch on your willingness and ability to manage expenses and margins going forward in different outcomes, different scenarios. You pulled forward, it looks like salary increases. So does that pull forward some of the OpEx growth we normally see in fiscal 2023? And then just thinking through, if we were to see downturns economically, what kind of willingness and an ability do you have to really manage margins going forward?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. The pull forward of salary increases means that when we get to the fourth quarter of next year, we'll lap the increase that we have. So in that sense, yes, it moderates a little bit the impact on next year since some of it comes into this year. You've seen us in the past adjust based on external circumstances, and we will be monitoring trends and will stay flexible and move fast if we have to, again. That said, this is a business with tremendous long-term growth opportunities. We think the new use cases that are being developed in the new flows business and the opportunities we have across value-added services for global expansion, for deeper penetration of existing clients as well as adding new services are very significant. So we have to be keeping an eye on the long-term opportunity and not under-investing. Having said that, if times get tough, we -- as we did during the pandemic, you prioritize, you sequence things, you pace things. You don't pull back on all the investment. You just try to do it based on a new reality. So during the pandemic, for example, we scale back in certain areas like cross-border where spending on marketing or things like that wouldn't have made any difference because borders were closed. And we'll try and do things like that if we have to again.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks so much. Great results. Very clear. The consumer is strong here. And I know, Al, you said you don't want to predict the macro, but I figured I'd ask if you can comment here on how resilient Visa might be now versus past recessions, because on the one hand, I'm thinking of this product credentials, acceptance, contactless or that would suggest more resilience. But on the other side, you have more value-added services revenue that might be more cyclical. So I know aside from shocks like the financial crisis and pandemic, your growth premium to PC has been clear. But what about now? Do you feel differently? Any new thinking on how Visa might be different versus past recessions? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Well, thanks, Tien-Tsin. I think we're a very different company from any past recession, I guess, going back to 2008-2009 time frame. First of all, we're strong -- much stronger in debit, which tends to be the vehicle, the card of choice for people in a slowdown period. We're stronger in everyday spend categories. We're stronger in e-commerce. We benefited from this acceleration in cash utilization that happened during the pandemic. Since the last recession, we've added Europe, which is a very important part of the company today and contributes to our growth. And then as you alluded to, we've added an emphasis on value-added services and new flows. Some of those value-added services are tied to volume. So the degree that some volumes might go down, those might go down as well. But on the other hand, for volumes that we will have today that we -- that will have the opportunity to sell more value-added services than we would have in the prior recession. The last thing I would say is that it is very possible that today, people are changing what they're buying, but they're not changing how they're paying. And we fall into the latter category. And we see overall spending levels, as we talked about remaining high, and we continue to see people choosing to pay with Visa not depending on any change that they might be making in what they're buying or the baskets that they have.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon. So Al, I want to follow up on your comments on the banking. So now that you closed the Tink acquisition earlier this year, can you elaborate on your efforts in open banking and what role can just play? And just taking a step back, how excited are you about the opportunity that in open banking for Visa? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Well, I think open banking is in its early days, but I think that we're quite well positioned. As you well know, that the ground zero for open banking happens to be Europe. We have a very good business there. And obviously, Tink has a footprint in 18 markets in Europe. It has a single API that allows customers, primarily developers that access financial data. It has connectivity to 3,400 banks and financial institutions and greater than 10,000 developers. And we believe the thesis for us is that takes capabilities with our capabilities and our relationships will allow Tink to be stronger where it already is, and will -- with our help, we'll be able to broaden their footprint in which Tink operates. And that's certainly one of the things that we're in discussions internally with Tink, as to where we go next in the world. We also think that our infrastructure and our cyber and fraud capabilities and our capabilities related to protecting the customers' transaction at all the steps along the way is going to just help accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe. So we're excited about the prospects of it. We think we're really well positioned. It's just going to be a matter of how quickly it takes off, but we're in good shape to the degree that it does.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. I wanted to ask about the three key drivers, all growing over 20% in consumer payments, the new flows and value-added services. As we think about going forward and how this is likely to normalize some, I assume consumer payments growth will slow as cross-border eventually lap some tougher comps. But maybe new flows and value-added services still has some extra juice for growth. Just hoping maybe you could parse through some of the pluses and minuses for the three segments.\nAl Kelly: Well, Bryan, that's been the thesis from the beginning that we want to make sure that we generate on a sustained ongoing basis attractive revenue growth. And you're certainly correct that at some point in time, depending upon the pace at which Asia cross-border comes back and US inbound cross-border continues to come back, that will settle back into some more normal level growth rate for consumer payments. I'm not going to predict when that will be, whether that's in two quarters or six quarters or seven quarters, but it will happen at some point in time. And our expectation and aspiration has been that value-added services and new flows will grow at numbers of percentage points higher than consumer payments that will, therefore, allow us to get to sustained revenue growth rate that we think, over time, will be attractive to the investors in the company.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDon Fandetti: I just want to confirm, so just given all the weakness of some of the retailers, you're not seeing any signs on the low-end consumer weakness. And then does your data historically show any correlation around a wealth effect for the more affluent US consumers at Visa?\nAl Kelly: Don, you're touching on -- there's a number of elements that impact our volumes. And we'll touch on a few of them. Affluent spenders are returning to the economy and their higher spending in restaurants and travel, among other categories. And this isn't necessarily inflation, but a mix shift. The impact of people working from home and hybrid work definitely continue to have impact on smaller tickets that are things that people buy in the mornings and at lunch time, when they're actually commuting and working in an office environment.  Certainly, small tickets, as a percentage of overall tickets, are still below pre-pandemic levels as a result. Last year, stimulus clearly drove ticket sizes up, particularly in discretionary categories, and we're kind of lapping that now. What we don't know are what level of substitutions are taking place, where people might be buying more staples and less discretionary items, but they're spending at the same level they did, or whether as some retailers have said, people are trading down from brands to private labels. But it's also difficult for us to understand consumption reduction. So, for example, consumers could be buying less fuel, but spending at the same amount or buying smaller package sizes of things like snacks and yet spending the same amount. So, I think, Don, clearly, inflation is in our numbers. And people are likely to change, making some changes on what they're buying. But as I said earlier, I think in response to Tien-Tsin's question, they're not changing how they're paying.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I mean going back to your question on whether we're seeing any slowdown in spending by lower income consumers. No, we're not. We keep looking for it because we've heard some other people say it, and we're not seeing any evidence of that. Your second question, I presume was the wealth effect on affluent consumers of what's happening in the stock market and things like that?  As Al said, I mean we're not seeing that. If anything, affluent spending has been on the rise and is one of the reasons why we've seen some of the robust growth we saw this quarter. Remember, we're lapping a very significant growth quarter last year that included sizable stimulus payments. And despite that, we had some very good growth this quarter. And a lot of that is driven by affluent consumers, by discretionary spending coming back and no evidence of a wealth effect that people are holding back.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good afternoon. You've clearly been continuing to be very aggressive on share repurchase. But could you update us on your capital allocation priorities in this particular environment? We've seen obviously a pretty big pullback in valuations and payments. How is your acquisition appetite and pipeline changed today versus, let's say, a year ago?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Capital allocation has -- approach has not changed. As we've said before, our first priority is investing in our core business. We generate a lot of free cash flow. Our first priority is to invest in what is a fabulous business we have, which has tremendous growth opportunities as we've discussed around some of the new use cases and new flows around value-added services and of course, in our core consumer payments business. After that, clearly, it's how can M&A enhance what we do, and we can do that by buying something that expands our capabilities like we've done in the past, or something that gives us new capabilities like Tink does with open banking or like Currencycloud does with the capabilities they have that are geared towards real-time FX and serving the needs of newer enterprises, the Fintechs rather than traditional companies. So, we will continue to look for things that can enhance what we have. In terms of timing and opportunities, clearly, as valuations have come back in, we've stayed disciplined when things are bubbly. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have tremendous capacity. We are definitely interested in acquisitions where the value is justified. Time will tell where the valuations in private markets get to levels that are attractive and companies have to be for sale. But clearly, M&A is an important component of our future. We have clear ideas on where we want to expand M&A-wise. And as they come up, we'll talk about it.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Your line is open.\nRayna Kumar: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In your remarks, you mentioned pricing actions helped your cross-border revenue. As you look across the breadth of your products and services, do you think there's still more opportunity to improve pricing in certain areas?\nAl Kelly: Yes. Something that we will watch and be very thoughtful about over time. But we have -- we've got years and years of experience in pricing in the consumer payments business and we're building our sophistication in terms of pricing in our newer lines of business in new flows and value-added services. As we said many times, our philosophy is that we want to make sure that we're pricing in a way that balances all the various parties within the ecosystem and ideally stimulates more and more cash digitization and more and more money movement across our network. So, in short, we think there definitely is still more opportunity in the pricing lever.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hey Al, hi Vasant. Great quarter here. It's pretty clear based on your results and comments that the consumer seems unaffected so far. My question was, are you seeing an impact in your conversations with enterprises, so basically banks, merchants and fintechs, given what's going on in terms of either the pace of decision-making or the types of products or services that they're seeking out now? If you could comment on that.\nAl Kelly: I have not heard that from any clients or partners that I have talked to. Look, I think everybody is out there wondering whether we're going to or not going to face a recession. We're certainly undeniably in a high inflation environment right now. But given that, that was really driven by a shortage of workers leading to a shortage of production of goods and services and then, you throw the Ukrainian war on top of it, which had some impacts along the way, and all of this coming off of a pandemic, there really isn't a history that provides any kind of insight into exactly what might happen here. We're continuing to do two things. One is to make sure that we're smartly investing in the future to drive our three growth levers. And as Vasant alluded to in response to a question earlier, we're being very vigilant in looking into the numbers and seeing if we see anything that requires us to be proactive in any action that we might take. But at this point, as I think we've said a few times now, the level of consumer spending up through July 21, which reported on in Vasant's remarks, have the consumer spending has remained very resilient. And for how long that will be, one, it remains to be seen. But again, I'd remind everybody that we don't have the same input costs and COGS as other businesses. And we're a company that facilitates payments. So regardless of whether people are consuming differently or substituting one good for another good, they still need to pay for it and they're utilizing our services to do that.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. Thanks for all the color and commentary, Al and Vasant. Obviously, you can track quite well how the consumer is tracking now across all the different metrics, as we've talked a lot about. When you look at forward, can you talk a little bit about what you look at as potential indicators? And I guess, especially since as Sanjay started off the questions around travel, what are you seeing in things around forward bookings and any changes or indications there or elsewhere? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. As Al said, I mean, we don't view ourselves as economic forecasters and don't want to get into that. And we've said before that we are not leading indicators. We probably coincident indicators. If there's a change in spending, we'll see it as it happens. The only area of our business where we see a little bit ahead is, as you said, in travel bookings, and those are holding up well. Whether it's cross-border bookings or domestic travel bookings, if you look at the card-not-present element of travel which is where those bookings happen; there is really no change in trend. So at least looking out 30, 60 days, which is what the lead time is on those kinds of things, there is no change in trend. Other than that, a lot of what we see is quite intuitive. There's -- as Al said, there's a shift towards discretionary purchases. There's a shift towards things people couldn't do before, during the pandemic, experiences around restaurants, entertainment and travel. As we said, while goods may not be growing as much as they were year-over-year, they're still well above the COVID -- pre-COVID trend line. So there's nothing there that is out of the ordinary at this point.\nJennifer Como: Last question Jordan.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks guys. I just wanted to come back to cross-border travel. Now that you were at, I think, 116% of 2019 levels in July, I know your prior target was to be at 100% by the end of the fiscal year. So what would be your new target there? And then can you just comment on inbound versus outbound US, kind of where that's tracking versus 2019 levels and your thoughts going forward there just given the strength of the dollar? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. I mean outbound from the US is very strong. It's been about 2019 levels now for a few, if not weeks, a couple of months. Inbound to the US, we told you was indexing in the high 80s. So it's still below 2019 levels. And we think that there's room for recovery there. What we've seen on the cross-border side is a little bit of a stair step where you have periods where there's rapid growth like you saw in April and May and we saw in October and November, when a variety of countries remove restrictions, you see a huge amount of travel happening fairly quickly. And then you see a certain amount of stabilization after that, like we saw partly because of Omicron in December and January, and we saw in March and April. As you look at the fourth quarter, most of the world is open. And so we are assuming steady improvement in travel out of Asia, steady improvement of travel into and out of Europe, improvement of travel into the US. But there are no big openings left, which is why we don't think there'll be a big stair step up in the fourth quarter. We'll wait and see. The big openings left would be China, of course, which we gave you the index. It's still very low. And there's recovery left in Japan, because letting in 20, 000 people is one-fifth of what the normal amount of people who go into Japan were. It's more like 100,000 people. So there's a few left. So the short answer is a modest recovery in the fourth quarter, and we'll see what happens.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal second quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining. Before jumping in, I want to acknowledge that this is Jennifer Como's first earnings call in her new position. About 2 months ago, Jennifer was promoted to Head of Investor Relations, which was a very well-deserved recognition of her work over the last 3 years with us. I want to start by briefly addressing the situation in Russia and Ukraine. I have seen firsthand the pain brought about by Russia's attack on Ukraine and its people, including our colleagues in both Ukraine and Russia. We are very focused on supporting them. The bravery, strength and resilience of our colleagues is incredibly inspiring, as is the grit of the Ukrainian military. Even with the invasion of Ukraine and lingering impacts of Omicron, volumes, transactions and credentials drove strong second quarter performance. Overall, PB was up 135% versus 3 years ago. Cross-border volumes, excluding inter-Europe, were 112% versus 3 years ago. And it's important to note that travel-related cross-border rose to 82% versus 3 years ago, up 5 points from Q1. Processed transactions were 138% versus 3 years ago. In terms of the big picture, after the short 4- to 5-week impact of Omnicon in December and January in the United States and many other parts of the world, the recovery continues to be robust. At this stage, in terms of volumes, we have seen no noticeable impact due to inflation, supply chain issues or the war in Ukraine. In the U.S., payments volume index to 2019 was 144 in the quarter. Volume growth relative to 3 years ago has been stable and strong now for 4 quarters in a row. When looking at specific spend categories for credit cards, we saw greater than a 10 percentage point improvement in the 3-year index from Q1 to 2Q -- Q2 in travel, retail goods, food and drug, restaurant, QSR and fuel. As a reminder, debit is growing over a quarter in fiscal '21, where there were 2 stimulus distributions. Even as credit continues to recover, debit remains 20% above the prepandemic trend line. Across all products, spend categories representing 88% of PB are over 120% indexed -- over 120 indexed to 3 years ago, and nearly 2/3 are between 1 40 and 1 60. Against this backdrop, Visa's performance was very strong. Net revenues grew 25% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $1.79, up 30%. As we look ahead, our business will have a reset due to Russia, but we still expect accelerated revenue growth versus pre-COVID over the coming years. This is because there's still ample opportunity around the world across our 3 growth levers of consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, and our strategy is yielding excellent results. First, in consumer payments, we continue to displace cash at a strong rate. In Q2, we saw debit cash volumes at Visa grow 2%, while debit payments volumes grew 12%. Cash displacement continued around the world. Year-over-year, across debit and credit, there were 7.9 billion more payments transactions and 16 million less cash transactions. Last quarter, I highlighted the shift from cash to payments volume in Latin America, and that trend continued in this quarter. Additionally, CEMEA is experiencing a similar shift. In full year 2019, cash was 59% of total volume. Last year in Q2, it was 50%. And this quarter, it was 46%. Growth in consumer payments is driven by adding credentials and acceptance and deepening engagement. Our card credentials recently increased to over 3.9 billion, up 9% in 1 year, including 10% growth in the United States. On the acceptance side, we have 80 million merchant locations, including small businesses behind players like Stripe and Square, the number is actually over $100 million. We have seen very strong performance location growth recently in our Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, up 30% and 20%, respectively. Let me just highlight a few regional examples of progress in consumer payments. In Europe, overall credentials grew 6%, which is nearly double the historic rate for each of the past 8 quarters, helped by previously announced deals with BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium contributing more than 4 million credentials since their announcement to issue with Visa. Across Europe, we continue to strengthen our debit business. We recently announced the [indiscernible] bank, representing a multimillion credential opportunity. We also renewed our business with one of the largest banks in the Nordics, Nordea. On the acceptance front, we continue to pioneer new areas of acceptance even in mature digital markets. One recent in example in Europe is with electronic -- electric vehicle charging. We were the first payments and financial services company that joined the charging interface initiative and are working with manufacturers to open up what is estimated to represent 3 million potential acceptance points in Europe by 2030. In Latin America, we saw strong credential growth, up 21% year-over-year. Two renewals to highlight this quarter: Porto Seguro, Brazil's third largest issuer for credit portfolio and digital bank, Neon Pagamentos, one of Brazil's fastest-growing fintechs with over 15 million clients for their credit and prepaid portfolios. In Africa, Visa has signed a partnership with Vodacom South Africa. This deal, together with previously announced partnerships with M-PESA Africa and Safaricom covers 130 million customers in the entire Vodacom Group in Sub-Saharan Africa. Through this partnership, Vodacom will exclusively issue Visa payment credentials, deploy new payment flows through Visa Direct and utilize cyber source. In the United States, we renewed and won several partnerships this quarter. First, Visa and USAA have recently renewed our long-standing issuing partnership. Second, we extended our existing relationship agreement with M&T Bank as their issuance partner, including migrating the business resulting from their recently completed acquisition of People's United. Over the past 2 years, merger activity of regional banks has increased, and this is another example of Visa successfully partnering to grow with our clients. Finally, supporting the U.S. government is an important priority for us, and we retained our business with the financial agent that manages the U.S. debit card program. This Visa-branded program is a key component of Treasury's goal to deliver 99% of federal payments digitally by 2030. A key vector of growth in consumer payments are cobrand cards, which are particularly attractive to the affluent customer. In Q2, affluent credit card spending was well above 2019 levels in several markets, including the U.S. and the U.K. Our U.S. cobrand active cards were up nearly 30% from 2019 to 2022. And we have 7 of the top 10 cobrands in the United States and 8 of the top 10 cobrands globally. This past quarter, we renewed our cobrand relationship with AAA, Visa's longest-standing cobrand partner, an over 40-year relationship. In India, we're pleased to have signed a long-term cobrand agreement with Airtel, one of the largest mobile operators in the world with nearly 356 million subscribers. In CEMEA, Emirates NBD, a leading banking group has expanded its long-standing partnership with Visa by introducing the premium cobrand program with Etihad Guest, the loyalty program of Etihad Airlines with 8 million members. In Uganda, we partnered with the Uganda National Social Security Fund to issue cobrand cards to 2 million beneficiaries. And just a few weeks ago, it was announced that the U.S. Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card has been renewed with Chase and Visa. Visa is also pleased to have reached a broad global agreement with Amazon. This agreement includes the acceptance of Visa at all Amazon stores and sites today, as well as a joint commitment to collaboration on new product and technology initiatives to ensure innovative payment experiences for our customers into the future. In Q2, we also continued to enable new ways to pay from installments to crypto. In the installment space, we previously announced a global deal with Klarna. They have now issued their cobranded card in Europe and recently opened a waitlist in the United States, where they have 25 million customers. In the crypto space, we continue to work with governments globally on potential CBDCs. This quarter, we were selected as the finalist in Brazil's CBDC lift challenge. The concept is a B2B solution that seeks to leverage CBDC to help small businesses access global investors and drive financial inclusion. On the engagement front, Tap to Pay continues to accelerate growth. In the United States, we are over 20% tap to pay penetration, marking the second largest market by number of tasks. And Target has become the first U.S. retail merchant to pay us 50% tap to pay penetration of face-to-face payments. Transit is one of the best ways to habituate tapping and the first half of fiscal '22 has set records. We enabled 50 cities around the world, including Thailand, Japan, Turkey, Italy, Switzerland, Norway and Canada, bringing our Tap to Ride footprint to over 500 travel transit authorities. We processed over 500 million Visa tap to ride transactions globally versus 700 million for all of last year. To summarize, there is significant opportunity in consumer payments, Visa continues to grow credentials and acceptance with deepening engagement and Visa enables innovation and scale for players across the ecosystem from installments to crypto to merchants. Now moving to new flows, which in Q2 had over 20% revenue growth. In Q2, our commercial payments volume was 138% of 2019. What's more of this recovery is relatively broad-based across segments and spend types. On the B2B carded front, in the U.S., Umpqua Bank announced two commercial solutions for middle market businesses. One, Visa Commercial Preferred, a commercial rewards card designed to help manage daily business spend; and two, Visa Commercial Pay, which will help improve cash flow management, reconciliation and reporting. In Latin America, we saw a carded progress with B2B fintech, Tribal, which has chosen Visa for card issuance, including virtual cards on its modern corporate card and spend management platform tailored for startups in 9 countries. Airwallex, a global platform, enabling digital businesses to manage payments and money movement across borders, previously launched programs with Visa in Australia, Hong Kong and the U.K. Recently, they introduced virtual Visa cards in the United States, Netherlands and Singapore to enable businesses to easily make digital card payments around the world. In our cross-border B2B business, Visa B2B Connect continues to expand its global footprint. And in the first half of 2022, we added banks for the first time in Tanzania, Uganda, Angola, Thailand and Poland. Now turning to Visa Direct. Transactions in the second quarter grew 20%. Vasant will speak more about this, but Russia was our second largest market for Visa Direct and represented about 17% of our transactions in fiscal 2021. So in short, Visa Direct will -- be impacted by the suspension of Russian operations. But even with the Russia business -- without the Russia business, we will see growth ahead driven by many use cases and countries. For example, domestic P2P, which accounted for the majority of our Russian business is still a large opportunity, and we continue to expand to new markets. We will soon launch our inaugural Visa Direct use case in Israel for P2P in partnership with Bit, the largest P2P app in the market. I'll focus on 2 other use cases today, payouts and remittances. First, with payouts, we see -- we're seeing momentum in a number of industries and transactions are up 35% year-over-year. In travel, we launched Visa Direct with Booking.com to enable customer refunds and loyalty payouts. In the gig economy, Payfare, a leading fintech that has partners such as Uber, Lyft and DoorDash, has added Visa Direct to its platform to help facilitate real-time payment experiences for over 0.5 million gig workers they serve. And digital commerce partner, Payoneer, we use Visa Direct to enable cross-border payments for their 5 million customers, including marketplaces and gig economy players. Second, cross-border P2P or global remittances, which are higher yielding Visa Direct transactions represent a significant opportunity. While we are just getting started this quarter, transactions grew nearly 50% year-over-year. After announcing our relationship in fiscal fourth quarter with Paysend, an international card-to-card payments platform, which serves over 6 million customers and 17,000 SMEs, they have now launched their cross-border service with Visa Direct from the U.K. and U.S. to over 100 corridors. While the U.S. is the top source for remittances, the UAE is the second largest source for country remittances followed by Saudi Arabia according to the World Bank. Altogether, the Gulf Cooperation Council countries account for more than $100 billion in outbound remittances. This past quarter, we added several partnerships to help digitize remittances in the region. First, AL Muzaini Exchange, the largest exchange house in Kuwait. Second, Enjaz, the remittance and payment arm of Bank Albilad, and market leader for ongoing remittances in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And third, in the UAE with LuLu Money powered by Lulu International Exchange and Network International to enable the 5 million users of Lulu app to send money to cross-border. [Audion] and Stripe, key Visa Direct enablement partners have both signed agreements to deepen relationships in existing geographies and to expand to net new markets globally across numerous use cases. In sum, we've made excellent early progress against the $185 trillion new flows opportunity, but there is tremendous room for accelerated growth ahead. Now let me move to value-added services, which had Q2 revenue growth of over 20% as well. First, we recently closed our acquisition of Tink. Tink is a European open banking platform that connects to more than 3,400 banks that reach over 250 million bank customers across Europe. Through a single API, Tink enables its customers to move money, access aggregated financial data and use smart financial services such as risk insights and account verification. Visa brings proven infrastructure and sustained investment in resilience, cybersecurity and fraud, which will help accelerate the adoption of open banking and create a secure, reliable platform for innovation. Let me highlight some other progress in value-added services. First, Visa consulting and analytics. Last quarter, I announced the launch of our specialized global crypto advisory practice. We've seen interest from hundreds of clients globally and have committed engagements with 30 already covering their digital currency strategy, product development and their go-to-market plans. Second, risk identity and authentication. In tokenization, we have now crossed the 3.5 billion token mark across more than 8,600 issuers in over 150 markets at 1.2 million merchants. Tokens have led to a 2.5 point increase in approval rates and a 28% reduction in fraud rates this past quarter in card net payment -- card net present payments. Our key risk solutions, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, screened about 30% more transactions in the first half of 2022 versus 2021. Third, CyberSource, our gateway capability has seeing considerable progress, just crossing the milestone of the 1 millionth merchant account onboarded. I spoke about transit before in CyberSource, which could play a key role in transit acceptance, added nearly 15 projects in the first half in Thailand, Italy and Japan, among others. So to summarize, our value-added services represent a compelling way to diversify our revenue streams while helping our clients bring in -- in bringing innovation to the payments ecosystem. Our global infrastructure is providing connectivity through our network of networks to power more traditional payment types and newer ways to pay and move money. Our brand is strong. Our network of networks is expanding. Our business is performing well and our people are motivated and passionate. We expect all our efforts will help power accelerated growth in the years to come. And with that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Despite Omicron, Russia and Ukraine, our fiscal second quarter results were very strong with net revenues up 25% and GAAP EPS up 23%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 30%. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was approximately 27% and non-GAAP EPS growth was 30%. A few key highlights. Global payments volume growth has remained strong and stable relative to pre-COVID levels. In constant dollars, the U.S. index was 2 points higher than the first quarter at 1.44 versus 3 years ago. The international index, ex China, was down 2 points at 1.40 versus 2019 due to the impact of Omicron in early January. Omicron impact on most domestic volumes was short-lived as we hoped it would be. The robust cross-border travel recovery that started in the fall as borders reopened, resumed in February as Omicron impact faded. Border restrictions were lifted quickly and pent-up demand for travel remains very high. Index to 2019, cross-border travel, excluding transactions within Europe, jumped from a low of 71 in January to 94 in March. The first 2 weeks of March saw a spike in cross-border volumes from Russia and Ukraine due to displacement caused by the invasion. After we suspended operations in Russia in mid-March, there were no more cross-border transactions in or out of Russia. Adjusted for Russia and the spike from Ukraine, the March cross-border travel index relative to 2019 was around 90. So far, we are not seeing any material impact on cross-border travel in other corridors as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Our 3 growth engines: consumer payments; new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues well over 20%. During the quarter, we bought back $2.9 billion in stock at an average price of around $2.10 -- $210. On March 10, we closed on the Tink acquisition. Finally, our second quarter P&L and balance sheet reflect our best estimates for the impact of suspending operations in Russia. This includes revenues and expenses from terminating all client and supplier contracts, resolution of settlement balances and the deconsolidation of our Russian business. We have adjusted 2 items from our GAAP earnings, expenses to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine and a charge related to net assets in our Russian legal entity. Now on to the details. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 17% year-over-year and 35% versus 2019. Debit spend remained resilient as credit spend continued to improve. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 18% or 42% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume grew 16%, up 44% versus 2019, which was 2 points better than the first quarter. Credit grew 27% and improved 4 points to 35% over 2019, helped by the affluent consumer. Debit grew only 6% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of stimulus last year, but growth remained very strong versus 2019 at 53%. As Al indicated, debit is indexing well above the pre-COVID trend line, benefiting from accelerated cash digitization. U.S. card presence spend grew 17% and was 21% above 2019 at its highest quarterly level since the pandemic. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 10% and was 70% above 2019. Relative to 3 years ago, e-commerce levels remain well above the pre COVID trend line even as card-present spend continues to recover. International constant dollar payments volume, excluding China, grew 22% and was 40% above 2019. A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 44% year-over-year and 99% higher than 2019 with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region grew 18% year-over-year and 76% higher than 2019, led by client wins and cash digitization. Excluding Russia, the CEMEA region was up 100% over 2019. The Europe was up 21% year-over-year and 31% higher than 2019. Following an Omicron dip in January, we saw a rapid recovery in most European markets. Ex U.K., Europe volumes grew 36% year-over-year and were 54% about 2019. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region, up 16% year-over-year and 25% versus 2019. Due to COVID restrictions, recovery across most of Asia has stalled Hong Kong declined relative to 2019. India recovered strongly, up almost 20 points from December. India has been our fastest-growing market in Asia, up almost 80% since 2019, fueled by a tripling of e-commerce volumes. Global process transactions were up 19% year-over-year and 38% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, were up 47% year-over-year and 12% over 2019. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, remained strong, up 16% year-over-year and well above the pre-COVID trend line at 67% above 2019. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 111% year-over-year and indexed at 82% of 2019 levels. As I mentioned earlier, after an Omicron driven dip to 71 in January, the cross-border travel index to 2019 rose sharply to 94 in March. Many corridors are now indexing about 90 relative to 2019. Inbound travel to Latin America, the Caribbean and parts of the Middle East has been above 2019 levels for some time now. There's plenty of recovery to come in one important corridor inbound to the U.S., which indexed only at 70 in Q2. Asia indexed in the high 30s, both inbound and outbound in Q2. The pace of travel recovery to and from Asia will be a key driver of the future trajectory. Most Asian borders are now opened, except for China and restrictions remain in place in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Moving now to a quick review of second quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 24%, faster than the 20% nominal growth in Q1 payments volume. We were able to bill and collect service revenues in Russia through early March. As such, in the second quarter, we recorded almost 2 quarters of service revenues related to Russia. Service revenues were also helped by increasing utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 16%, below the 19% processed transactions growth mostly due to exchange rate changes. International transaction revenues were up 48% versus the 42% increase in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and select pricing modifications, partially offset by business mix. Other revenues grew 21%, led by consulting, data and marketing services as well as travel benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our 3 growth engines, each growing well over 20%. Consumer payments growth was led by improving cross-border volumes and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by Visa Direct and carded B2B recovery. Visa Direct transactions grew by 20% impacted by lapping a strong quarter in the U.S. last year and a suspension of Russian operations. As Al indicated, Russia was the second largest market for Visa Direct, accounting for 17% of transactions. This is an unfortunate setback but the Visa Direct business is ramping fast in other international markets as well as in use cases such as cross-border remittances, earned wage access and other B2C payouts. Commercial or B2B volumes grew 29% year-over-year, and up 38% versus 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength of small business and the recovery of large businesses across the portfolio of diverse spend categories. Value-added service growth was led by consulting and marketing services, card benefits as well as risk and identity solutions. Revenue growth drivers include the acceleration of e-commerce, client growth in international markets and select pricing actions. Client incentives were 25.8% of gross revenues at the lower end of expectations. This was driven by a better revenue mix due to the faster-than-expected recovery of our cross-border business and by deal timing, with some Q2 deals being pushed into Q3. GAAP operating expenses grew 11%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 16%. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $127 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $133 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19.6%, GAAP EPS was $1.70, non-GAAP EPS $1.79, up 30% from last year. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buybacks, we returned $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. A few comments on our trends through the first 3 weeks of April. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 12%, with debit up 2% and credit up 26%. Debit volumes are lapping the impact of stimulus payments in 2021. U.S. April spend growth versus 3 years ago was up 45%, with debit up a robust 54% and credit up, 37%. These trends are relatively consistent with performance in major markets around the world with the exception of CEMEA where we now have no payments volume from Russia. Processed transactions grew 17% year-over-year, up 36% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 47% year-over-year, and were 15% over 2019. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 62% about 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were at a 92 index to 2019. The small decline in this index relative to March is mostly due to the loss of Russia. Total cross-border volume was up 28% over 2019. Moving now to our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2022. Just as 2021 was a year of 2 distinct halves, due to the recovery, 2022 will be a year of 2 halves due to Russia. The suspension of our business in Russia will reduce second half revenues by about 4%. Russia will also negatively impact the payments volume and cross-border volume index to 2019, each by 4 points. The impact on process transactions index to 2019 will be under 1 point since we did not process domestic transactions in Russia. Ex-Russia and Ukraine, our domestic volume growth has stayed robust and stable for the past 4 quarters relative to 2019. Our outlook for the second half assumes that these trends are sustained. While there are uncertainties created by high inflation, supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and the invasion of Ukraine, there is no evident impact on our global payments volumes. E-commerce spend, both domestic and cross-border has remained strong and stable relative to 2019 at well above the pre-COVID trend line, even as pandemic effects fade, and we are assuming this will continue. In line with payments volumes, we expect processed transactions growth relative to 2019 to remain strong and stable with the variability largely driven by the extent to which small ticket card-present everyday spend comes back. It is important to note that year-over-year growth rates will moderate as we lap the strong second half recovery in fiscal year '21. Ex Russia and Ukraine we're assuming no spillover effects on other corridors in our cross-border business. Given where we ended the second quarter, we now expect cross-border travel ex intra-Europe to fully recover to 2019 levels by the end of our fiscal year despite the loss of Russian business. Including intra-Europe, that would put cross-border travel above 2019 levels.  With these assumptions, third quarter net revenues are expected to grow at the upper end of the mid-teens range in constant dollars. This includes Tink & Currencycloud, which add approximately 0.5 point to net revenues. The dollar has strengthened and the exchange rate drag will likely reduce nominal rate revenue growth by around 2.5 points. Due to some deals moving into the third quarter from the first half and the expectation that certain milestones will be achieved on some key contracts, incentives will run higher in the third quarter, between 26.5% to 27.5% of gross revenues. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in constant dollars to grow in the mid-teens, including expense savings from Russia and almost 3 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink. Exchange rates will likely reduce nominal operating expense growth by about 1.5 points. Our tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range. At this point, we expect fourth quarter trends to be generally in line with the third quarter. As always, we will update our fourth quarter outlook in July. Based on results to date and our outlook for the second half, we expect full year net revenue growth in constant dollars in the high teens to 20% range, including approximately 0.5 point of contribution from Tink and Currencycloud. Exchange rates will likely drag nominal growth rates down by around 2 points. There is no change in our expectation for full year incentives. Incentives as a percent of gross revenues are expected to range between 25.5% to 26.5%. We expect constant dollar non-GAAP operating expense growth at the upper end of mid-teens. This includes savings from the suspension of Russian operations and almost 2 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink. Nominal operating expense growth will be around 1.5 points lower due to the stronger dollar. Our full year tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range. Despite the uncertainties caused by inflation, interest rates, the invasion of Ukraine and our exit from Russia, we expect fiscal year '22 will be a very strong year of above-trend top and bottom line growth. As we enter the post-COVID era, we remain confident we can sustain a rate of growth about pre-COVID levels for all the reasons Al outlined, which I will summarize again. First, an acceleration away from cash and check for merchant payments, both domestic and cross-border as digitization becomes pervasive across consumers and businesses globally. Second, acceleration of cash, check and wire transfer displacement as our new flows initiatives penetrate a broad range of new use cases with very large total addressable markets. Third, sustainable high-teens growth across value-added services, both from existing services and new offerings. As new flows and value-added services become a larger part of our revenue mix, growing faster than consumer payments, the sustainable growth rate will continue to rise. We are and will continue to invest in the capabilities required to capture the extraordinary growth opportunity ahead of us. With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat: Vasant, I want to ask about cross-border. So had the pandemic not happened, your cross-border volumes would have been at least 20% to 30% of the 2019 levels, if you just kind of go with historical run rates. Now clearly, the travel probably has been solid these past few months. My question is how important is it that Asia, specifically China, comes back for you to have cross-border travel, not just going to 2019 levels, but eventually kind of returning to the pre-pandemic rate of growth?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, Harshita, that is a great question. As you know, 2 things we told you on the last call have remained true. One that, generally, countries around the world want to keep borders open, China being 1 exception, and some restrictions in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. And I include Hong Kong also in that list. Other than that, you can travel pretty freely anywhere else in the world. Some of them need tests, some don't even need tests. So that's true. The second is the pent-up demand for travel remains very high. And early indications on summer bookings, et cetera, as you heard from other people have been very good. So in our sort of calculations, certainly, we've been surprised so far even though we were bullish with how fast things have recovered. As you saw, after January, the recovery has been very robust. At this point, we're pretty optimistic that inbound to the U.S., which is still indexing only at 70 as of the end of March -- as of the end of the second quarter is on a good recovery track. There's still some recovery left in and out of Europe. So those things will certainly help us get back to 2019 levels. And you're absolutely right, I think the how fast and how far we get to, where we should have been prepandemic will depend on Asia coming back. Asia indexed at under 40 in the second quarter. China is an important part of Asia, it is still incredibly depressed. Japan, Korea and Taiwan are also important parts of Asian cross-border travel. Asia is recovering. We're seeing some good trends in Asia. Certainly travel into parts of Asia, like India, Thailand, Indonesia, et cetera, Australia and New Zealand are picking up fast. But you're right. I mean, getting all the way to 130 will depend on the remaining big travel components in Asia, which would be China, Japan and Korea, really coming back. And we'll have to wait and see on that, and we'll update you on the next call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: I had a follow-up call -- a question on commercial cards. I think you called out that your commercial card volumes are running at 138% of 2019 levels, so pretty healthy growth there. Can you talk more broadly, I feel like this is maybe a piece of the business that doesn't get the attention it should, given how much cash and checks and wire and other forms of payment there still are in commercial, can you maybe talk a little bit about the initiatives you've got underway to accelerate the digitization or the converting more of these B2B payments into cards.\nAl Kelly: Well, thank you, Lisa. This B2B segment is about $122 trillion opportunity, of which $20 trillion is in the carded space and then a $10 trillion in the cross-border space. So in the carded space, we already are the largest provider of commercial card volume. And our focus has continued to be on growing the number of issuers that are issuing commercial cards because it's a lot less than the number of people issue consumer cards. And we're also very focused on the travel and fuel use cases in addition to obviously purchasing cards and corporate cards, which are a more traditional element of this carded B2B space. We're also trying to continue to grow acceptance. There are acceptance gaps in the commercial space that hold us back from getting all the volume that we could potentially get. We are making strides, but there's still a ways to go in terms of having an acceptance footprint that mirrors the type of broad-based acceptance footprint that we have on the commercial side. It's a very important part of the business. It has attractive yields. It's -- generally has the ability to -- it was growing faster than consumer prior to COVID, and we believe that it can grow faster than consumer when we get back to a more normal time post the pandemic and obviously, one big factor there will be the pace at which business travel returns.  In the cross-border space, obviously, our major thrust there is B2B Connect. And our major focus on B2B Connect continues to be to grow out the network by having more and more banks in more and more countries involved in the network, and that has been and continues to be our focus more so than driving transactions at this point. And our belief is that once we get the network to a level where it is quite robust that transaction flow will happen fairly quickly. So those are some of the things that we're focused on to try to drive this very, very important space, which I continue to believe is an enormous opportunity for us going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you so much. Very strong broad-based results, which is what I want to ask about. With you far exceeding your revenue outlook, it looks like the client incentive planned is at the very low end of your expectations. So I just want to make sure I understand the relative performance there between the 2. Is it something that the upside and revenue brings with it very little incentive pressure? Or is it more complicated than that?\nVasant Prabhu: No, it's 2 things, Tien-Tsin, as I said in the comments. Number one, you saw that our cross-border recovery in the quarter was stronger than we expected. We'd had expect a good recovery, but this was stronger than we expected. That improves our mix, but even with the strong recovery, our mix of cross-border is still lower than it was prepandemic. So the mix affects the percentage. As you know, the percentage is numerator and denominator. When cross-border grows disproportionately, the denominator grows without a commensurate increase in the numerator, just given the nature of how many of our incentives work. And that helps that percentage, and that's why the percentage came at the lower end of the range. The second reason is there are always timing factors, timing factors in terms of renewals, timing as in when we recognize incentives linked to achieving certain milestones that contracts have, and that has pushed some of those incentives into the third quarter. So we expected third quarter to run above the upper end of the range, so to speak. For the full year, we still expect to be in the range we gave you. So it's all driven by a combination of mix and timing.\nAl Kelly: The only thing I would add, Tien-Tsin, you followed us for a while. I mean there's art and science to this, in forecasting. And a lot of times, just dealing with the timing point that Vasant was talking about, we make assumptions about when deals will get done. We then make assumptions about how long it will take to get a deal launched or get a migration going and then we make assumptions about the performance of that deal. And the odds of us getting all of that right across hundreds of deals that happened during the course of the year. make this not the easiest thing to always forecast. But I think we do a largely good job, but the explanation that Vasant gave about why we came in at the low end this quarter is those main 2 factors of timing and mix, driven by outperformance across the border.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Vasant, you spoke to the 4 percentage point impact in the second half from Russia. And obviously, it seems like you're able to overcome some of that with the stronger cross-border trends. Maybe you could just parse through a little bit of the impact to EPS and the flow through for us? I know there's some expenses that you mentioned that can offset Russia, maybe just help us through that.\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. So it is a 4-point revenue impact from Russia. So that's pretty much what the revenue impact would be. We gave you a sense of what our revenue expectations are for the quarter in constant dollars, upper end to mid-teens. If it hadn't been for Russia, you'd have added 4 points to that. So it's still strong despite that. And as you said, it's because the loss of Russia is offset to some degree by the cross-border business being stronger. We have a similar issue or similar impact on the expense side, mid-teens expense growth helped by Russian expenses going away and there are 2 main Russian expenses that go away. We used to pay the processor in Russia for processing transactions. We no longer have to pay them. Obviously, when you're in business, you do marketing and provide a bunch of other services. Some of our personnel-related costs in Russia will remain. We've made some commitments to our employees in Russia about other roles. So those don't all go away. So that does reduce our expenses in the second half. Probably, in the range of about 2 to 3 points. On the other hand, we do have Tink and Currencycloud now that are coming in, which were not there last year, and that's about 3 points. So it sort of washes and goes in the other direction. And then finally, exchange rates will help expenses to the tune of about 1.5 points. So those are all the moving parts. Our expenses would have been probably 2 or 3 points higher if Russia had not been -- if operations in Russia had not been suspended.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Great. And you probably get more flow-through from the cross-border outperformance, correct?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, partially. Mainly, because the incentives would go with it tend to be lower and it's a higher-yielding business. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: Listen, it's great to see your constant currency guidance increase for the full year despite what's obviously happening in Russia, Ukraine in organic and to some degree with a small help from acquisitions. Just to be clear, we're still getting a follow-up from a couple of investors asking to make sure that includes the impact for the full year of Russia as well, right? And then I just want to double check. I mean, you guys continuously highlight the potential to exit the pandemic at an accelerated growth rate, and I'm sure it has a lot to do with the new flows and some of the new services opportunities you're seeing grow so well. Can you just reiterate on that and just go into a little more detail on what gives you the confidence there? And what kind of growth rates you should be able to achieve?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think the biggest thing, Darren, for me is we didn't take the last couple of years off in terms of going out and trying to convert business, sign fintechs, increase our business with traditional partners. We also have phenomenally grown our acceptance footprint in certain parts of the world.  So there's actions that we have taken that -- you haven't seen the flow through because of the fact that the pandemic has, in many cases, suppressed spending. But as I think we come out of the pendent you'll see the flow-through of the various actions that we took. And then I think the pandemic itself has accelerated people's usage of card-not-present in e-commerce, and I think that's a sustaining model that's going to help drive growth on a going-forward basis as well. So I think we're going to see ourselves taking advantage of that. And then, certainly, we have continued to add use cases to things like Visa Direct. We've continued to build out our risk and identity tools. We've continued to grow our Visa consulting service. So I think that my view is that the market hasn't seen the flow-through of a lot of the investments -- the full flow through of a lot of the investments that we've made over the last 27 months-or-so when we've been operating in this kind of odd world driven by the pandemic. And I think that as we start to come into a more normal environment, I think you're going to see it. So that's the biggest factor. Vasant, do you want to address Darren's first question on I guess it was Russia?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Yes, Darren. Our full year outlook incorporates the impacts of Russia in the second half. It reflects the fact that the second quarter was as strong as it was. So when you look at the first half and what growth we had in the first half, despite the impact of Russia on the second half, in constant dollars, we still expect to be in the high teens to 20%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar : I wanted to just shift gears away from cross-border and ask about Tink and how you intend to use Tink to grow it, including both geographical growth and functional proliferation as it relates to debit -- Visa Direct broad payments functionality, things like that.\nAl Kelly: Well, thank you. Just as a reminder for everybody, I highlighted Tink in my remarks, but I didn't talk about the fact that it's got thousands of developers on the other side of the 3,400 banks that I did cite. And today, it operates in 18 markets across Europe. Its revenue model is largely a per API call, although there are some subscription basis on some of its value-added services. Our goal is to position ourselves in the middle of open banking in a place -- in a world where it's most advanced, which is Europe. And we believe that our complementary capabilities will help drive adoption of Tink's capabilities and provide incremental value to clients. Clearly, our -- maybe not clearly, but I'll make it clear. Our focus initially is going to be on Europe. That's where Tink is strong, that's where it's got a large presence, and that's where we could -- we think that we could be additive in terms of driving their business forward. But certainly, we will -- we anticipate and anticipated when we looked at Tink and made the decision to buy it, that we will leverage its capabilities and extended their capabilities to other markets. But we want to make sure that our investment is focused. We never like to kind of peanut our investment across too many places at one time. So it's better, we think, to perfect our partnership together in the place where we both have strength, which is Europe, and we'll go from there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: So I was just curious, for the quarter itself here in Q2, I think you would expected net revenue growth to be at the high end of high teens. Obviously, that was before the war started. You ended up in the mid-20s. So I'm just curious in terms of order of magnitude, like which revenue lines really surprised you the most to the upside? To what extent was inflation a meaningful contributor? And then it sounded like maybe you pulled forward some Russia service revenue, I think Vasant you made a comment there. I was hoping you could maybe quantify that piece as well.\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. So the primary factors that allowed the quarter to be stronger than we expected was clearly international revenues. And international revenues were not only stronger in terms of cross-border volumes being stronger than we expected. The recovery was from 71 to about 94 index to '19 between the end of January and March, which was clearly very, very strong. So that definitely was 1 of the outperformers. Because of the war in Ukraine, currency volatility was also high, and the fact that the cross-border business helps volumes add-in currency volatility and our treasury revenues were also higher than we expected. So those were 2 major contributors. And on the service line, as you know, we recognize service fees with a lag. In the case of Russia, because operations were being suspended, we were able to bill and collect revenues for the second quarter through when we suspended operations, and that added probably -- it would be less than 1 point to revenues, maybe a little over 0.5 point. So that did help. But other than that, it was all driven by just strength across the board. Value-added services performed very well, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nBob Napoli: I mean, Visa has obviously been consistently active on the M&A front and on venture investing. With valuations down, would we -- should we expect to see Visa being more active in both areas? And if so, what areas, products, geographies, I guess, verticals would be most attractive for Visa incrementally to add to invest?\nAl Kelly: Well, Bob, I'll start and Vasant can add any color he wants. We still have a stated preference for whatever we could do ourselves to do it ourselves. That said, we have a very robust and qualified corporate development function that looks at all kinds of various possibilities. And we're in constant review of various lists to determine what might be of interest and what might not be of interest. Will we can do it faster and get people who have unique skills that we might not have, and we could build that -- it's just much faster than building the capability ourselves, we'll certainly look to buy. And without getting too specific, I think that continuing to grow our toolbox as it relates to new flows and value-added services and things that would help us do that would be certainly areas that would be attractive to us. I probably wouldn't want to say more than that at this point. The only other thing I'd say is that we're really not -- we don't really look to be an active venture investor. Many of our -- and most of our investments or things where we're following on a commercial agreement, and often, when we do a commercial agreement with a smaller player, they ask us for us to endorse them a bit by making a small investment so they can add up to the roster of players that are investors in their company. But we're not out there speculating and looking for just venture investments where the vast majority of them, and Vasant can add or delete, almost 100% of them are because we've got a commercial deal in place first, that's the most important aspect to us.  Vasant, anything you want to add?\nVasant Prabhu: No. I think what you will see in the future is more of what you've seen in the past. Acquisitions that can add to our capabilities like Tink did, like Currencycloud did expand the suite of services we can offer, which is what both Tink and Currencycloud do. Acquisitions where we decide it's faster or cheaper to buy than to build. In some cases, it could be acquisitions that expand the scope of an existing service like Earthport did with our payouts business around the world. And yes, to the extent that the correction we're seeing in public markets carries over to private markets over a period of time, certainly, we expect to be more active. And we have no specific objectives in terms of we're going to do X amount in acquisitions every year. It's going to be based on what makes sense to do and where we can create value.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse.\nTimothy Chiodo: I want to touch on Visa Direct. Clearly, it's a much bigger but still fast-growing portion of your business. You talked a little bit about the growth this quarter and the Russia impact. And you also mentioned it as the second largest geographic market. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that geographic mix? And less on maybe the other large markets, but more importantly, maybe the markets where there's a big opportunity? And the brief follow-up would be if you could just recap the mechanic around, your ability to, of course, send to Visa Credentials, but also how does it work when you want to send to a Mastercard credential and that capability.\nAl Kelly: The -- for competitive reasons, I'd be reluctant to get too into the weeds on this. But obviously, our biggest market is the United States. Russia was our second largest market. And then there's a number of markets across the world that are maybe a half dozen to 10 that are somewhat together in terms of size that they represent. And our focus at this stage is to: A, build greater penetration of the use cases that we have today; secondly, to develop new use cases; and thirdly, to grow the geographic footprint of all of our use cases. And we have built up a team completely focused on Visa Direct. We do utilize our account executives around the world as our frontline sales agents. And then from there, we'll bring in solution experts who know much more about the specifics of Visa Direct. But we're -- so basically, I talked about payouts and remittances. We're continuing to look at the ability to pay gig economy workers, which is a growing and hugely growing segment around the world. We're looking at global money movement use cases beyond the ones that I've talked about in P2P, which we've talked about before. We're looking at digitizing disbursements by replacing checks and slow ACH wherever we can around the world. The reality is that I think there are applications everywhere and one of our challenges, especially as we look to replace some of the volume from Russia is going to be determined where to invest versus having to find places to invest. There are plenty of places to invest, which is the great news. We're just going to have some work to do to figure out exactly where the hottest opportunities are to drive transaction growth for us as we look forward at various use cases.\nTimothy Chiodo: Excellent. And were you able to help on that mechanical one around maybe the difference in terms of mechanics or economics when you send to a Mastercard credential?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. It's part of our network or network's approach. So we're network agnostic and acquisitions like YellowPepper and what we did with Earthport are the kinds of capabilities that allow us to send to any credential, including a bank account as part of -- we'll get your money there and part of the way maybe on the rail that's not ours.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: I appreciate all the details and color. Wanted to -- gotten a few questions from investors, just around the impact that inflation may be having. And A, can you help quantify it? Maybe how that's benefiting Visa? But also and maybe more importantly, can you talk about if you're seeing any shift in spending behavior by consumers and that mix between discretionary and nondiscretionary spend. And if that has any impact at all on how you're formulating your outlook.\nAl Kelly: So there are -- inflation has some puts and takes on our business. Service fees and international fees are basis points on volume. So inflation typically lifts transaction size, but we\u2019re offsetting that and incentives are also tied to volume, so there's some offset to that lift.  Fuel prices go up, but then on the other hand, sometimes consumers tend to moderate their buying in times of large increases in gas to the degree that, over time, if it was to happen, the dollar was to weaken, that increases inbound cross-border flows and the U.S. inbound corridor is one of our largest and higher-yielding corridors. Expenses for personnel and marketing, professional fees could go up. But I'd say 2 things and then ask Vasant to add anything he wants. So far, we're not -- as I said and I think what Vasant said in his remarks, we're really not seeing much impact that's causing us any concern in our numbers. And then the last thing I'd say, net-net, historically, inflation has been positive for us.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Just to add to what Al said, I mean we clearly have seen -- we've seen ticket sizes go up in the U.S., in particular, in Europe, but it's not all inflation. Some of it is mix. It's mix driven by the fact that the card-present transactions, which often tend to be smaller transactions, have not yet fully come back. It's mix also because e-commerce transactions, even when you do everyday purchases, can be larger ticket sizes. We could even see ticket sizes go down in inflationary times as card-present comes back. So as Al said, there's multiple impacts from inflation. Net-net, it's a positive for us. We have not seen any impact on discretionary spending that we can discern. If anything, discretionary spending, especially from affluent consumers and credit cardholders has been going up quite healthily. So in general, there isn't any evidence impact -- evident impact on inflation, but obviously, we'll keep looking for it.\nAl Kelly: James, I'll just share 1 quick data point with you. We recently looked at restaurant spending by various strata and the highest-performing strata in terms of growth is the $100 to $300 ticket price, and the second best performing strata was over $300. So that just gives you some sense. That's very recent data of the Affluent being back in the market and not afraid to spend in an important spend category.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.\nJamie Friedman: Vasant, I may be misremembering this, but my recollection was that you had contemplated returning to 90% travel index by September. I apologize if I got that wrong, you had -- you were going kind of quick with the updated assumptions. Can you repeat what you were contemplating now in terms of where travel would end the fiscal year?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. So we talk about cross-border travel ex intra-Europe, and we are now expecting, given where it ended the second quarter to be at or about likely 2019 by the end of our fiscal year. And you\u2019re absolutely right, the last time we talked to you, we said we'd probably be around 90%. We're running better than we expected so far, so we've definitely raised our view of that. Now inclusive of intra-Europe, that would put us above 2019 levels by the end of our fiscal year. So yes, I think you got it right.\nJennifer Como: Great. And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon to everybody, and thanks for joining us. Amidst much uncertainty this quarter resulting from the ongoing COVID pandemic. Visa's financial performance was very strong. Our net revenues grew 24% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, up 27%. And our financial performance was driven by record volumes, transactions and credentials. In Q1, we crossed the $60 billion payment transaction mark for the first time in history, up 26% from two years ago. Visa cards were used 28 million times per hour in the last quarter. And we also increased our card credentials to over $3.8 billion, up 10% in one year. I'm going to leave the rest of the details to Vasant as I want to focus on the future. As we look ahead, we expect accelerated revenue growth versus pre-COVID over the coming years, driven by our three strategic levers of consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Many current trends in payments, including A2A, RTP, Buy Now, Pay Later, crypto and wallets are enabling new ways to pay. These represent opportunities for Visa, where we are extraordinarily well positioned to utilize our unique strength and global network to help them grow and scale. Let me start by talking about consumer payments. The opportunity to displace cash and check is enormous. At our last Investor Day, we said it was $18 trillion. In Q1, we saw our debit cash volumes at Visa growth 6% while debit payment volumes grew 19%. While cash displacement is certainly a reality, global personal consumption expenditure of cash and check grew at a CAGR of 2% over the 10 years ending in 2019. When we look at the opportunity ahead, if you assume global cash grows at 1% annually, industry-wide digital penetration of personal consumption expenditure when it reached 90% for several decades. For example, in Latin America, until a few quarters ago, there was more cash volume than payments volume on Visa credentials. In fact, in the past year, there has been a nearly 6.5 point shift and payments volume is now 55% of the total volume, even with cash in Latin America growing 10% this past quarter. We have expanded acceptance locations in Latin America by almost 30% in the past year to 18.5 million locations, and we've grown credentials over 20%. This quarter, we signed an eight-year agreement with Santander Chile, one of the largest issuers in the country. And in Brazil, we recently signed a deal with Banco XP, one of the country's largest digital banks with over 3 million customers. Brazil remains a growth market with payments volume growth up more than 1.5x historic levels in recent quarters. The key to digitizing cash is that the on-ramps to our network have never been easier to access. Wallet providers have been rapidly issuing Visa credentials as they see value in an open-loop ecosystem. Naranja X is a rapidly growing Argentinian wallet using Visa cards with 2 million credentials issued between prepaid and debit over the last two years. This quarter, we renewed our partnership with PayPay Bank, which enables accounts to PayPay wallet users. PayPay is one of the fastest-growing digital wallets in Japan with 42 million users and the bank already has 4 million Visa debit users. We recently extended our partnership with Safaricom, the operator of M-PESA to cover African markets outside of Kenya, where M-PESA has 50 million customers. We're also providing on-ramps for crypto players creating connectivity with fiat economies. There are over 65 crypto platforms and exchanges that have partnered to issue Visa credentials. This quarter, Visa credentials and crypto wallets had more than $2.5 billion in payments volume, which is already 70% of the payments volume for all of fiscal 2021. In addition to embedding credentials and crypto platforms, we continue to innovate around our settlement and crypto API capabilities, which have been key differentiators for us for fintechs and financial institutions that are looking to extend crypto capabilities to their customers. We will continue to lean into the crypto space. And our strategy is to be a key partner to provide the connectivity, scale, consumer value propositions, reliability and security that is needed for crypto offerings to grow. Earlier this month, we previewed CBDC payment APIs currently in development, which would enable central banks to connect their Ethereum-based CBDCs with Visa rails through a wallet with digital issuance capabilities, enabling consumers to spend with CBDCs at any Visa merchant. We partnered with Consensus to develop this concept, which was selected as one of the winning entries out of 300 ideas from 50 countries at the global CBDC challenge as part of the Singapore FinTech Festival judged by representatives from the IMF, the World Bank, the Bank of International Settlements and the central banks of Brazil, India, Kenya and Indonesia. In the face-to-face world, tap to pay continues to accelerate growth. Let me highlight progress in a few larger markets. In Brazil, the tap to pay penetration has increased from 5% to 24% in the past year. In India, where we have increased merchant locations 30% since fiscal year 2019 to $6 million at the end of fiscal year '21, the tap to pay penetration has nearly doubled to 16% in the same period. And all of these efforts have helped to fuel our 40%-plus year-over-year growth rate in payments volume in India this past quarter. In the United States, we're nearing 20% tap to pay penetration with key metro cities showing even stronger growth: L.A., Seattle, Detroit, Orange County, Miami and Salt Lake City have all surpassed 25%. San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland are up over 30%, and New York has reached 45%. E-commerce is also key to digitizing payments and e-commerce merchants are certainly growing as our relationships with them. We successfully closed a U.S. co-brand deal with Shopify, a key e-commerce platform with millions of global merchants and entrepreneurs. The Shopify Balance Card will allow Shopify's U.S. merchants to access funds from sales by the next business day and receive cash back on everyday business expenses like shipping and marketing. Buy Now Pay Later, our BNPL continues to grow, and we're seeing more and more BNPL fintechs issuing Visa credentials. Visa is enabling their shift to open loop so that their value proposition to consumers can scale through Visa's broad acceptance. Last quarter, I mentioned Corner. And this quarter, I'm pleased to announce that a firm has chosen Visa as their network partner for the Affirm debit card as well as renewing the virtual card business. We look forward to supporting Affirm's continued growth through Visa's wide acceptance and reach. BNPL fintechs are increasingly using Visa virtual cards to settle with merchants, driving triple-digit payments volume growth year-over-year in the United States. BNPL fintech consumers also continue to use their cards to pay off their installments with active cards growing 50% in the same period. For traditional issuers, we have a network installment solution called, Visa Installments, which enables our financial institution clients to seamlessly offer BNPL capabilities through an existing credit credential on any Visa transaction. In Canada, one of the countries where we are launching the capability, we now have commitments from issuers and acquirers representing the majority of payments volume. Credentials on our network of networks through BNPL, crypto, other fintechs and our traditional issuers bring compelling value propositions like identity protection, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, security, loyalty and more to consumers. This tremendous value motivates consumers to use their Visa credential online or in face-to-face versus cash, A2A RTP or even blockchains. So to summarize, the opportunity in consumer payments is huge and has an incredible long-term runway on ramp to our network of networks have ever been easier. We provide a compelling consumer value proposition and the advances in new ways to pay are good for Visa and these payment providers. Visa is enabling utility and scale for BNPL, crypto and wallets and all other nuance entrants. Now let me move to progress with use cases and new flows, which represents a $185 trillion opportunity, 10x that of consumer payments. We are seeing a large appetite from our partners and experiencing significant growth. A key driver is Visa Direct, which targets a $65 trillion opportunity across P2P, small B, B2C and G2C. These are all use cases that Visa didn't really serve just five years ago. By aggressively pursuing these flows with our more compelling solution, Visa is seemingly displacing alternatives that rely on fragmented and dated technology, not the other way around. Visa transaction growth was 35% this quarter. In the U.S., domestic P2P is currently our largest use case and also our lowest yielding one. As we scale and grow other geographies and use cases, especially those that are cross border, we expect the revenue yield to increase. Regardless of the yield, Visa Direct is accretive given it mostly leverages our existing platforms and capabilities. Usage is growing with banks signing on for global remittances using cards or accounts among them, the Qatar Islamic Bank, one of the largest banks in Qatar, and CIBC and Simply Financial in Canada. Visa Direct is also enabling fintech Chime and neobank Barra in the U.S. for account-to-account money movement. Usage has also expanded across several other use cases this quarter, such as payouts to DoorDashers in Canada. We also recently signed an agreement with Toast to leverage Visa Direct on several fronts. First, near instant cash flow access to daily sales and loan disbursements for their 48,000 -plus restaurant customers. And second, for fast tip payoff and earned wage access for their restaurant client employees. Visa Direct is a compelling capability because we offer incredible reach to more than 5 billion cards and accounts, global scale, a leading technology stack, world-class security and 24/7/365 reliability. All of which is easy to access through hundreds of partners across our global network of networks, reaching bank accounts through a combination of card, ACH and RTP systems in more than 175 countries. In the B2B new flows opportunity, we expect future growth to have several vectors. Let me just highlight a couple. First, B2B carded issuance in both physical and virtual cards where we have a leading share. This quarter in India, after partnering with leading B2B neobank Open for several years, we signed a deal for credit and debit issuance as well as the implementation of Visa Direct. In virtual card, we're expanding to new verticals. One recent example is health care. And this quarter, we signed an agreement with a direct health care company NoMe Health, a health care provider that serves 30,000 people per day across 10 U.S. states for its claims payment solution. A second vector of B2B growth is large ticket account based cross-border payments through Visa B2B Connect, which links our global payments infrastructure with best-in-class capabilities to address the primary pain points of existing solutions. In Latin America, Visa B2B Connect is available in nearly 30 countries, and we've enrolled partners in more than 1/3 of those countries already. One partner is Banco, a leading bank in Mexico since enabling the solution in March of 2021, the bank has grown Visa B2B Connect volumes double digits every quarter and has processed thousands of payments and hundreds of millions of payments volume. We also recently added Sberbank, the largest bank in Russia, Eastern and Central Europe, which will be live and processing transactions later this year. So to summarize new flows, the opportunity is 10x consumer payments. Our capabilities and value proposition are strong versus the competition, and we expect revenue yield to continue to improve as we scale and grow Visa Direct, especially in cross-border use cases. Now let's move to value-added services. In Q1, revenue grew over 20%, and we expect strong growth to continue. One example is with Visa Consulting and Analytics. In addition to our crypto offerings that I mentioned earlier, we recently launched a specialized global crypto advisory practice to help financial institutions eager to offer customers a crypto solution, retailers who are looking to delve into NFPs or central banks exploring digital currencies. Another example is with the authentication. In Europe, we have tripled the use of Visa's new authentication technology, EMV 3DS since the start of 2021, and this is coincided with a reduction in card present fraud by 28%, and it has also positively impacted the transaction authorization rates. And we are launching new capabilities to build for the future. Visa Acceptance Cloud enables clients to move embedded payment processing software from individual devices to the cloud, eliminating the need for expensive terminals as well as the cost and time to certify the processing software. In addition, clients can access value-added services from fraud management to BNPL. We also recently closed our acquisition of Currency Cloud. We believe the combination of Currency Cloud's APIs on the front end, which provide real-time foreign exchange capabilities and our settlement capabilities across our network of networks. We will have a very compelling value proposition. Together, we can enable new use cases and payment flows particularly as we expand the cross-border use cases, we provide our clients, including B2B Connect and Visa Direct. We can extend our FX platform for easy connect easier connectivity for fintechs and non-financial institution partners, and we can offer real-time FX rates and improve transparency for our partner customers. So to summarize value-added services, we will continue to bring Visa innovation to the payments ecosystem. We are diversifying our revenue mix, and this will help us retain and win business and grow revenue well into the future. In conclusion, as I think about Visa's future, I'm extremely optimistic and energized. While much has been written about new payment types being potentially disruptive to Visa, we see a lot more opportunity than disruption. Our global infrastructure is providing connectivity through our network of networks to power more traditional payment types and newer ways to pay and move money. Our interconnectivity, security, reliability, consumer and fraud protections, risk management and other value-added services offer a superior experience. We expect to attract more and more transactions, which will continue to fuel our growth at an accelerated rate. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2022 is off to an excellent start with net revenues up 24% and GAAP EPS up 29%. Non-GAAP EPS adjusted for items, including investment gains and the litigation accrual was up 27%. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was approximately 1 point higher at 25% and non-GAAP EPS approximately 1.5 points higher at over 28%. A few key highlights. We had a very sharp recovery in cross-border travel in October and November as much of the globe ex-China moved to reopen borders or announced timetables to open borders and listed restrictions such as quarantines. As a result, card present and card not present travel, which exited September at an index of 61 to 2019 rose. steeply to hit an index of 72 for the first quarter. Border reopening came sooner than we had anticipated and as we've seen throughout 2021, consumers are very quick to actually. As Omicron hits some border shut and some restrictions were reinstated. However, as we speak, moreover, being reopened, and restrictions lifted, and we expect the travel recovery to resume as we head into February. Payments volumes remained robust through the quarter globally with index for 2019 stepping up relative to the prior quarter by 2 points in the U.S. and 6 points internationally. The credit recovery continued and debit growth remained strong and stable. U.S. holiday retail spending was specifically strong more than 40% over 2019. E-commerce continued to gain share retail spending up 5 point since 2019. The impact of Omicron on domestic volume has been modest. As the Omicron wave affects globally, we expect the impact to ease as it has in market such South Africa and the UK weaker among the first to be helped. Revenue growth was very strong across our three growth engines. Consumer payments and new flows net revenues grew in the mid 20% range and value added services revenues grew over 20%. We significantly stepped up the pace of our stock buybacks during the quarter. We acquired 19.4 million shares for $4.1 billion at an average price of $210. And our Board authorized a new $12 billion stock buyback program in December. Also in late December, we closed the currency cloud transaction. Now on to the details. In constant dollars, Global Payments volume was up 20% year-over-year and 26% versus 2019, each accelerating 3 to 5 points versus the last quarter, led by continued strength in debit as well as improving credit spending. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 22% or 31% higher than 2019 and a 4 to 5-point acceleration from the fourth quarter. U.S. payments volume grew 22%, up 32% over 2019, both higher than Q4. Credit grew 27% and improved 6 points to 23% above 2019, helped by affluent consumer and small business spending. Debit grew 18% year-over-year and remained very strong at 43% about 2019 similar to the last quarter. As you can see, debit spend has remained resilient even as credit recovered. U.S. card presence spend grew 25% and was 17% above 2019, improving 2 points at its highest level yet in the pandemic, driven by fuel, retail and entertainment spending. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 16% and about 2019, similar to last quarter. E-commerce growth remains robust even as card presence spend continues to recover. U.S. retail spending during the holiday season grew double digits and more than 40% of our 2019 levels, both of which are very strong by historical standards. The share of holiday card present retail spending improved a few points from last year, but was still 5 points lower than 2019 as the shift towards e-commerce over the past decade continues. Retail shopping is happening earlier in the holiday season than it used to, which is a trend that started last year. As a result, relative to 2019, November volumes were stronger than December. U.S. holiday spending trends are fairly consistent with other major markets around the world. International constant dollar payments volume, excluding China, grew 22% and was 29% about 2019, improving 7 points from the fourth quarter. A few regional highlights: Latin America was up 44% year-over-year and 66% about 2019, accelerating 8 points from the fourth quarter with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region remained strong, up 31% and 58% from 2019 levels, accelerating 10 points from the fourth quarter, also fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Europe was up 17% and 23% from 2019, improving 3 points from the last quarter due to strong performance across Continental Europe. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region, up 16% both year-over-year and versus 2019, but the recovery is finally underway with an 11-point improvement from Q4, mostly due to relaxed restrictions. The largest improvements were in Australia, India, Southeast Asia and Japan. Global process transactions were up 21% year-over-year and 26% over 2019, 2 points better than the fourth quarter, accelerating less than overall volume growth due to higher ticket sizes. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was up 51% year-over-year and was 1% above 2019 volumes, a 15-point improvement from the fourth quarter. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, continued to strengthen, up 26% year-over-year and 50% above 2019, 7 points higher than the fourth quarter as consumer engagement continues to grow. Cross-border travel-related spending, excluding intra-Europe, grew 102% year-over-year and was 72% of 2019 levels, improving an extraordinary 14 points from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. The recovery in the first two months of the quarter versus 2019 was very fast and broad-based with outbound travel from each of our regions improving more than 10 points relative to 2019 from September to November. Inbound travel to the U.S., Canada, EMEA and Europe, all improved about 20 points during that time, while Latin America and Asia each improved at least 5 points. This recovery was driven by a combination of border openings, the relaxing restrictions and pent-up demand. Countries such as the U.S., Singapore, Thailand, Australia, Chile, Argentina and many more reduced friction for inbound travelers. The U.S. to Europe corridor remained open. This deep travel recovery started to lose momentum in the last week of December as Omicron spread around the globe. We expect this to be short-lived. Moving now to a quick review of first quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 19%, slightly better than the 18% nominal growth in Q4 payments volume, helped by increased utilization of card benefits and small pricing modifications. Data processing revenues grew 19%, slightly below the 21% processed transaction growth, mostly due to exchange rate changes. International transaction revenues were up 50% consistent with nominal cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Other revenues grew 17%, led by consulting, data and marketing services as well as travel-related benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer Payments grew in the mid-20s led by improving cross-border volumes and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows also grew in the mid-20s driven by Visa Direct and the carded B2B recovery. Visa Direct transactions grew 35%. We're lapping very strong quarters from last year, which is moderating U.S. growth rates. Meanwhile, the international business is ramping fast as is growth from use cases such as cross-border remittances earned wage access and marketplace payouts. Commercial or B2B volumes grew 28% year-over-year and up 26% over 2019, a 5-point improvement from the prior quarter, mostly in credit. The growth is helped by share gains and a portfolio of diverse spend categories that is not overly dependent on T&E. Value-added services revenue grew over 20%, led by risk and identity as well as consulting and data services. Growth was driven by new client adoption, increased usage among existing clients and international expansion. Client incentives were 25.1% of gross revenues, about 1 point below our expectations. This was a result of a significantly better revenue mix due to the faster-than-expected recovery of our cross-border business. As our revenue mix continues to normalize with the cross-border recovery, it will help this ratio. GAAP operating expenses grew 24% inclusive of $145 million litigation provision associated with U.S. interchange multi-district litigation case. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 16%, in line with our expectations. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $231 million. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $110 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 19.3% was in line with expectations. Our first quarter tax rate is typically a little lower than the full year rate. GAAP EPS was $1.83. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, up 27% over last year. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buyback, we returned $4.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. A few comments on our trends through the first three weeks of January. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 13%, with debit up 4% and credit up 25%. As you assess these numbers, it is important to remember that there was a government stimulus disbursement, which caused the surge in debit spending in early January 2021. January spend growth versus 2019 was up 40% with debit up a robust 52% and credit up 29%. These trends are relatively consistent with performance in our major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 17% year-over-year, up 37% versus 2019, lagging volume growth due to larger ticket sizes. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis grew 44% year-over-year and was 4% above 2019. Card-not-present non-travel growth remained strong at 67% above 2019, up 17 points from the first quarter. The cross-border travel recovery has stalled since late December due to Omicron, indexing at 72 to 2019, in line with the first quarter. Border reopening, and we expect the recovery to resume in February. Total cross-border volume was 14% above 2019. Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter. Domestic volume growth has stayed robust and stable for the past three quarters. While Omicron has had some recent impact, it has been modest and will ease as the way of crest. This is also the case with e-commerce growth both domestic and cross-border. We are assuming that these trends continue. The swing factor is cross-border travel. As discussed, the cross-border travel recovery was very rapid in October and November as the U.S. border reopened and many countries ease restrictions or announced plans to do so. With Omicron surging, some restrictions were put back in place and some reopening plans were put on hold. However, restrictions are being eased and border reopening. We're assuming the cross-border travel recovery resumes in February. As such, we expect net revenues to grow at the high end of high teens in the second quarter, including over 1 point of exchange rate drag. Incentives should grow at a similar rate as the first quarter, which as a percent of gross revenues will likely be in the 25.5% to 26.5% range based on volumes, renewal activity and cross-border performance. We expect organic non-GAAP operating expenses growth at the high end of mid-teens with some additional investment spend. The inclusion of currency cloud will add another 1.5 points to non-GAAP operating expense growth. Tax rate is expected to come in at the high end of the 19% to 19.5% range. We can also update some of the planning assumptions for the full year we had shared with you in October. Domestic payments volumes and cross-border e-commerce volume as well as the associated transactions are largely in line with expectations. At the end of December, we were running significantly ahead on cross-border travel indexed to 2019 relative to our assumptions in the fall. As such, we are now assuming that the cross-border travel index for 2019, excluding intra-Europe, end the fiscal year 10 points ahead of our prior assumptions are at 90%. Inclusive of intra-Europe travel, this would be back at 2019 levels. With these updated assumptions, net revenue for the full year would grow at the high end of high teens including 1 point of exchange rate drag. Obviously, revenue growth would be higher if the cross-border recovery is more robust in the second half and more akin to what we saw in October and November. With revenue mix improving from higher cross-border volumes, incentives as a percent of gross revenues would range between 25.5% to 26.5% for the year. We expect organic non-GAAP operating expenses growth at the high end of mid-teens. The inclusion of Currencycloud will add another point to non-GAAP operating expense growth. Tax rate is expected to be at the upper end of the 19% to 19.5% range. On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, the impact of Currencycloud is not material for the year. As a reminder, in our non-GAAP numbers, we make adjustments to exclude amortization of intangibles and nonrecurring acquisition-related costs. In summary, FY '22 is off to an excellent start. We expect our growth this year will be well above the pre-COVID rate as cross-border recovers. This will likely continue into fiscal year '23. Beyond that, we are confident the business can sustain a revenue growth rate above pre-COVID levels for three reasons. First, an acceleration away from cash and check for merchant payments both domestic and cross-border as digitization becomes pervasive across consumers and businesses globally; second, acceleration of cash, check and wire transfer displacement as our new flows initiatives penetrate a broad range of new use cases with very large total addressable markets; third, sustainable high-teens growth across our value-added services, both from existing services and new offerings. As new flows and value-added services become a larger part of our revenue mix, growing faster than consumer payments, the sustainable growth rate will continue to rise. We are and will continue to invest in the capabilities required to capture the extraordinary growth opportunity ahead of us. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Vasant. We're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Nice job. Al, can you start off by revisiting what you see as the key sustainable factors that's probably accelerated somewhat as the pandemic progressed? Whether that's services or it's just volume generally having shifted over faster? And then I guess on that note, as we get cross-border improving, you should get a pretty big pass-through to the bottom line. I'm just curious, your thought process around the potential for reinvestment versus rewarding shareholders?\nAl Kelly: Well, Darrin, I think, first in the near term, I think the upside is going to come from continued recovery of travel and the affluent customer getting back in the mix of spending at the levels they were pre the pandemic. In terms of sustained longer-term opportunities, I think they come in a number of places. First, e-commerce adoption is going to be very sticky and millions and millions of people around the world went to e-com and for the first time during the pandemic. Continued cash displacement is without question, going to continue. There's just simply more ways to pay, which is going to drive volume. Geographic expansion for us is another area where we're going to get sustained growth over time. And then I think continuing to penetrate both in new flows and the opportunities that we have with Visa Direct, B2B Connect and other areas within B2B, plus our ability as we capture more transactions to be able to sell our value-added services. So I think there's a a good number of levers that we can push that provide terrific growth for us going forward. In terms of your second question, I'll let Vasant weigh in as well. Look, Vasant talked about our updated planning assumption on cross-border where we think we're going to be about 10 points better than our original planning assumption. And certainly, that is going to be helpful for us. As we look ahead, we're going to continue to, I think, be very balanced in our thinking. We're conscious about making sure that our level of investment is at the appropriate levels against the right initiatives to make sure that we are managing the business and being able to fund growth initiatives into the future. But we're also conscious of making sure that we're careful about our expenses as we go forward as well, Darrin.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I mean going back to your question about shareholders and returning cash to shareholders, we did step up our dividend. It's $1.50 per quarter now. We did that last quarter. And then as you saw, we accelerated our stock buybacks. Our stock buyback is programmatic, but when we see opportunities, we step it up. And clearly, our cash flows are better. We felt there was an opportunity and we stepped up. As Al said, I mean our first priority is investing in our core business. There's plenty of opportunity here for growth. Second would be acquisitions that enhance our capabilities like Currencycloud and hopefully soon we close on Tink. And then, of course, we've always been returning cash to shareholders, most of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and buybacks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rayna Kumar from UBS. Your line is open.\nRayna Kumar: So as you both highlighted your debit volume remains very strong. Can you discuss how much of that strength is coming from Visa Direct and how sustainable that growth is in '22, of course, excluding the second quarter comp issue with the government stimulus?\nAl Kelly: Rayna, it's a couple of points, and it's been consistently that through the entire run of the pandemic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: I want to ask about inflation. Vasant, can you remind us how does inflation impact you? You obviously get benefits in purchase volumes, but how does it impact ticket sizes, consumer behavior in your view? And can you also talk about the cost and personnel expense aspect of it?\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. In terms of inflation as it relates to our revenues, as you know, our service fees, cross-border, et cetera, are denominated primarily in basis points on ticket size. So to the extent that there's inflation, driving up ticket size, clearly, it's beneficial to us. When it comes to transactions processing, our fees are generally tried to number of transactions. Right now, of course, the size of the basket has gone up. Some of it is because of inflation. Some of it is because it's just gone up through the pandemic. Some of it has to do with the fact that some of the smaller transactions, you've got in a normal world like people going and buying themselves lunch at work or a cup of coffee. We're losing some of those transits. And so that causes ticket size on a mix basis to go up, which will recover, and that will be good for our transactions business. And in general, when people are ordering in through e-commerce, basket sizes have tended to go up. So the basket size increase we see now it's partially inflation, partially it's some elements like the ones I just went through. So net-net, I mean we are a beneficiary of inflation. And in terms of wage inflation, generally speaking, I mean, we expect some everybody is seeing it. But overall, I mean, it's reasonable at this point, and we'll update you as time goes by, if it's more than we expected. Al, I'm sure you have things to add.\nAl Kelly: No, I think it was a very complete answer of Visa. The only other factor that you didn't mention relative to ticket sizes is something I said in answering, I think Darrin's question that as the affluent segment, which is the segment that -- who spending went down the most during the that comes back in, obviously, they tend to have higher ticket sizes as well. So, there's a number of factors that drive ticket sizes actually getting to precision on causality and what the different weighting of those different factors are is virtually impossible.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: So Al, you talked about the many reasons in your opening that you expect the growth to be a significant tailwind with many of the partners and products that you cited. It's interesting because many of the doubters sort of speak to that as the reasons to be concerned about the outlook. I'm just curious what you think they're missing. And I just had a follow-up for Vasant. In terms of the updated cross-border guidance, does that assume that there's a gradual improvement after February or that people go back to traveling like you saw in November and December?\nAl Kelly: Sanjay, I'd say a couple of things. One is that much of the innovation that we have seen is coming in ways to pay. And we're a network that is agnostic to the different ways people want to pay. We're truly a global open network that is willing to embrace fintechs and bigger players who want to introduce new ways for consumers to pay. We're not going to decide who's a winner or a loser. I'm not here to predict how big PNPL will get or crypto will get. I don't know. But I think that our job is to lean in and support them and give them a chance to have their capabilities or there are ways to pay run on our network. Ultimately, the consumer will decide who wins and losses based on the value that they believe that they're seeing as well as the user experience. I also think that the fact of the matter is if you look out over time, open networks win over closed networks. And Visa is a truly open global network with incredible reach and scale. And what ends up happening in any kind of closed situation is that after the initial excitement, initial pop, people run into a wall where it gets much more difficult to scale their businesses. And when somebody comes in and does business with us where we can make our 80 million or really closer to 100 million merchants available to them and help bring scale instantly and prevent people from having to for instance, go merchant-by-merchant in order to scale their business, we can do it much more quickly and much more efficiently for them. So I think that this kind of distinction between how to pay and a network like ours that is enabling multiple ways to pay is a distinction, I think, that people haven't fully appreciated.\nVasant Prabhu: Going back to your second question on cross-border, I think what's become evident from multiple data points over the last six to nine months, is that when borders open, it's like a switch turning on, the reaction is almost immediate. There's massive pent-up demand and consumers are quick to act. And what we saw in October and November was really the world opening up ex-China. And if it hadn't been for Omicron, that trend was quite extraordinary. Between September and November, we saw a very steep increase in cross-border travel driven by the opening of the U.S. border, the opening up of most borders in Europe. And what we started to see in October was many Asian countries, which have been the most restrictive, excluding China, of course, either open up or announce a timetable for opening up. So that tells you that opening borders, which is something that is hard to predict because governments control it can have a sizable and immediate impact. In terms of your question as to what is our assumption, our assumption is for steady improvement through the year. But we know it won't be steady. I mean there will be periods when borders open, and we could see some sharp improvements. And there may be occasional periods where if there is another variant, there may be some flattening out just as we saw in January. But the bottom line is it is very clear that when borders are open, things will move very fast to normalize.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nKen Suchoski: I wanted to follow up on the cross-border business. I mean some really solid results there. And I'm just curious to get your thoughts. Can you talk about whether this business gets back to pre-COVID trend growth? Or do you expect the cross-border business to get back to pre-COVID trend levels? Meaning does cross-border revenue and volume eventually catch up to where it would have been had COVID not happened?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, I think the short answer is we fully expect to get back to pre-COVID trend levels, meaning whatever the trend line was, we will get back to that trend line. And at least initially, the mix will be a little different because the part of the business that is growing well above trend is the cross-border business that right now is below trend -- below the trend line is the travel business. The e-commerce business cross-border is clearly one that we think can sustain above trend growth rates relative to pre-COVID. And if the travel business returns only to the pre-COVID growth rates, which we see no reason why it wouldn't, so let's assume it grows above pre-COVID growth rates gets to the trend line and then begins to grow at pre-COVID trend rates. We see no reason why that isn't the case. There is a possibility because of the e-commerce business that the cross-border business in total can grow faster than pre-COVID growth rates after it gets back to the pre-COVID trend line. I assume that is sort of what you were asking.\nKen Suchoski: Yes. That's exactly right. I appreciate that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: I had a couple strategic questions related to the Visa Acceptance Cloud announcement. First, is it open to all types of card payments? Or is it Visa only? And then second, how are you monetizing this Acceptance Cloud? And then the last one is, how should we think about the interplay between the Visa Acceptance Cloud and your ecosystem of acquirers and payment facilitators given that many of them have their own solutions in the POS space? I mean, is this -- are they embracing it? Or is it potentially competitive with their solutions?\nAl Kelly: Well, Lisa, first of all, it's early days with this. Our approach on this is to not charge for it because we think it's extremely valuable for the ecosystem to expand acceptance. And that's really the driving strategic force for us here is to drive acceptance. And certainly, my expectation is that once we can get the transaction on our network will have more opportunity to sell things like value-added services over time. But despite the fact that our network has the 100 million merchant locations, there is still a long tail of merchants around the world that are not accepting. And it's important that we do everything we can to bolster the acceptance footprint that we have around the world.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Just wanted to take your temperature a bit on the global regulatory landscape, does it feel more or less risky than, say, where we were pre-pandemic? I mean just given the political climate in the U.S. There's still the merchant litigation in Brooklyn, the Fed is proposing some changes to the Durbin Amendment. There were some recent reports out of the U.K. from the payment system regulator there. So just wanted to see how you're thinking about that overall or any areas of risk we should be potentially mindful of?\nAl Kelly: Jason, for as long as I've been involved in payments, there's always been regulatory issues and discussions that take place around the world. So it's really part of being in the business. I do not think there has been any material change in the environment in the last quarter or for that matter in the last year. I do think that the pandemic has helped governments recognize a couple of things though. One is the incredible importance of digitization because at a time when people around the world were locked down, they were able to continue to order food and order items delivered to their house because of digital, the digital payment ecosystem that is reliable and secure around the world. I also think that during this time, governments realize that they should become more digital. And we, during this period, helped a number of governments with the issuance of stimulus money or, in some cases, there was money to recognize the first responders and health care workers and those kinds of things. So I think there's more discussions going on with governments related to digital payments and we're helping them more. I'd also say that they, subject of Central Bank digital currencies, opens up and gives us an opportunity to talk to central bankers who, in many cases, are seeking our counsel as to what they should potentially be able to do. And I think that's because it allows us to have an avenue to potentially talk about other things that they might be contemplating from a regulatory point of view. So I guess, in sum, I'd say, regulatory attention is nothing new. There hasn't been any material change, and we continue to engage thoughtfully and frequently around the world with regulators.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Good to connect with you all. Just on the strong mid-20s revenue growth this quarter. I know it was nicely ahead of the of the high teens you talked about last quarter that you expected. Was it primarily cross-border that drove the upside or surprised. I'm just curious if there's any other callouts that you would point to because I know we've fielded a lot of cross-border questions. And then just quickly on rebates and incentives, I guess, the outlook 50 bps better than prior guidance, is that also primarily the result of cross-border? Any other impacts from pricing, et cetera?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. You're right, Tien-Tsin. I mean, the cross-border outperformance in the first quarter was primarily cross-border, but we also had value-added services performing quite a bit better than we expected. So strong value-add service was also a contributor. So those would be the sort of the two main drivers. As you know, we service -- when payments volumes outperform we booked the revenue with a lag. There was outperformance on payments volumes too, but that doesn't show up in the quarter. It certainly wasn't anywhere on the order of magnitude as our cross-border performance, but there was there's definitely. There would have been higher service revenues had there been no lag. The other part of your question was...\nTien-Tsin Huang: Rebates and incentives.\nVasant Prabhu: Rebates and incentives, yes, we have been saying for a while that those numbers were going up because of the mix change away from cross-border. We thought coming into this quarter that we'd be somewhere in the region of 26% at the low end of the prior range we had. We were a whole point lower entirely because our mix improved because of cross-border and the reduction in the range for the year is also driven by the improvement in the mix since we now expect the cross-border business to be stronger than we had originally expected.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. So it's all mix. Glad to hear it.\nAl Kelly: Tien-Tsin, the only thing I would add is that I think the -- we also had a very strong holiday period. And as -- based pointed out in his remarks or in answer to one of the questions, we've seen this phenomena of the holiday season stretching, and it's no longer really Black Friday to Christmas Eve. It's really starting early in November, driven by the incredible increase in the adoption of e-commerce.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Looking at the upgrade in your cross-border travel forecast for the rest of this year, does any of that include reopening of China? And if it doesn't, what impact would a China reopening have on the impact of -- on cross-border travel payments, obviously, depending on timing?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I mean we don't sort of -- no one corridor accounts for a big chunk of our volume. So China opening or not don't have to make specific assumptions on that. We certainly expect some opening in Asia. The big surprise in October before Omicron hit was Asia was opening up faster than we expected. So for example, Thailand pretty much opened up all their resorts. Now they did pause, but they've reopened them again now that the Omicron wave seems to be passing. We saw Singapore announced a phased opening plan, and I believe they're still on track to do that. We even saw Indonesia, India ease restrictions. So more kinds of people can travel to India without -- and Indonesia without quarantines and things like that. China is completely shut and it's hard to predict when it opens. So I would say on balance, we are not counting on a big recovery of the Chinese business. But otherwise, the big swing factor at this point is how quickly Asia opens and how restrictive is it after opening.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: The question I have is, you outlined a ton of great opportunities for future growth. But in many instances, there's like just so many, it's hard to kind of pull these things together. So when you take a higher kind of elevated look and you think about it from a secular growth versus cyclical mix of your revenues, where does it sit today versus maybe in the prior pandemic? And how should we be thinking about that mix shift to get you to that accelerated growth path?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I can start, and I'm sure Al will add. I mean, look in the short run the cyclical recovery is by far the biggest driver of the growth. Having said that, I mean, underneath the cyclical recovery, which is most acute right now in cross-border, you can see that other components of the business are not only stable but also growing at an above trend level. So if you look at our payments volumes. Credit is in a recovery mode, but debit is very resilient even as credit recovers and is at a growth rate, if you do a CAGR over the time period pre-pandemic, it's a higher CAGR than it was pre-pandemic. The same is true for e-commerce growth. You could say the same about our value-added services and new flows. So while the biggest driver of short-term growth being above trend is the recovery component. If you look below it, the underlying sustainable and secular growth trends are also about trend relative to where they were pre-pandemic.\nAl Kelly: Yes, I'd agree with all of that. And if we look at our growth by certain verticals, incredible growth in home improvement and food and drug and a lot of that, I think, is because there's all kinds of new models. People are buying online and picking up or buying online and getting delivery. A lot of these new ways of shopping and paying is going to help us drive growth in new ways going forward.\nMike Milotich: And with that, thank you, all of you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, you can feel free to contact or e-mail Jennifer or I, we're happy to help you, and have a great evening. Thanks so much."}], "2024": [{"symbol": "V", "quarter": 4, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-10-24 18:24:10", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Visa\u2019s Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Visa\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call.

For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today\u2019s earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic loss of life and suffering in Israel and Gaza. We are in constant contact with our teams in Israel and throughout the region, and I have the deepest admiration for their commitment to each other and their clients during this exceptionally challenging time. We continue to monitor the situation, prioritize the safety of our people and stay close to our clients to ensure the continuity of business operations. Turning now to our results. At the beginning of 2023, there was a lot of uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment with fears of a recession. There were many unknowns around FX, volatility, interest rates and inflation. There was also some noise in our growth rates in early 2023 due to the effects of Omicron and the suspension of operations in Russia. Against that backdrop, Visa delivered. Total full fiscal year net revenues grew 11% with GAAP EPS up 18% and non-GAAP EPS up 17%. Credentials grew 7%. We also surpassed 7.5 billion tokens. Total transactions, including cash and payment transactions, were 276 billion, which means that Visa credentials were used, on average, 757 million times a day during the fiscal year. We signed over 500 commercial partnerships with fintechs globally from early-stage companies to growing and mature players, up 25% versus last year. Merchant locations were up 17%, helped by strong growth in Latin America and CEMEA. Global Tap to Pay penetration, excluding the US, grew 5 points from last year to 76% of total face-to-face transactions. And in the US, penetration expanded 13 points to surpass 40%. Global tap to ride transactions were 1.6 billion for the full year 2023, up over 30%, and we added nearly 150 new transit systems throughout the year, such as in Philadelphia and Bangkok, bringing the footprint to more than 750 systems. More than 40% of our transit system launches this year also included our value-added services, Acceptance Solutions. On the new flows side, total revenue grew 17% in constant dollars for the full year. I'll note a few highlights. Total commercial volume was $1.57 trillion, up 12% in constant dollars. We have increased the number of banks that have signed on to Visa B2B Connect by more than 70% this year, and activation continues to happen with the number of transacting banks more than doubling. Visa Direct had 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% year-over-year and nearly 30%, excluding Russia, across 65-plus use cases and over 2,800 programs helped by more than 500 enablers. Cross-border P2P transactions grew 65% year-over-year and reached a new record for payments volume in the fourth quarter. Value-added services revenue grew 18% for the full year in constant dollars. Across our hundreds of products, our top 265 largest clients used 22 products on average, up 8% from last year versus our overall clients who used 11 products on average. With all of this strong momentum and performance, we finished the fourth quarter with net revenue growth of 11% and GAAP EPS growth of 22%. Other highlights from the fourth quarter include the following in constant dollars: global payments volume grew 9%; US payments volume grew 6%; international payments volume grew 11%; cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe grew 18% with cross-border travel up 26% year-over-year; and process transactions were up 10%. Across all our growth levers, we continued to drive progress in innovation and money movement. As I mentioned last quarter, when asked why Visa, our clients tell us they are choosing to deepen and expand their partnerships with us for a number of reasons, including our people, our products, our value-added services, our new flows capabilities and our brand. We continued to see that play out in our fourth quarter. I'll walk through each one and highlight some examples. First, our people. We have the best team in the business, and our clients tell us that they deeply value the advice, local support and partnership from our outstanding teams who are laser-focused on helping our clients grow their businesses. Our clients also appreciate our thoughtful leadership on important and complex industry issues across the ecosystem. An example this quarter was with US Bank, one of the largest issuers in the United States. They have renewed our long-term agreement for their consumer and commercial portfolios. In addition, we are engaging on consulting services and co-marketing projects that include leveraging our NFL sponsorship. Also in the US, we are very pleased to have renewed our long-standing relationship with top 20 US issuer FNBO across consumer, commercial and value-added services. In Brazil, credit unions or cooperatives are fast growing, and we recently reached an expanded relationship with Secovi, whose system spans nearly 340 cooperatives and 7.5 million members. In addition to our people, our payment products and innovations consistently help us win. We are constantly driving innovation and delivering next-generation payment solutions and experiences that enable our clients to better serve their customers and grow their businesses. In terms of our capabilities to serve fintechs, in Colombia, we expanded our partnership with Nequi, the first digital wallet in the country to enable their 17 million-plus account holders for tap to pay with digital credentials. We also provide targeted offerings for certain customers. In India, we are focused on delivering market-leading offerings for affluent customers. With that in mind, we have signed with fintech Appify for a consumer credit offering for high net worth and mass affluent customers. We also recently expanded our acceptance with fintech Razorpay to enable Visa debit cards to purchase mutual funds and securities, offering greater convenience to customers with higher payment success rates versus traditional methods. And in the e-commerce seller space, we renewed our agreement with Shopify for the Balance Card, allowing Shopify's US sellers to access funds from sales by the next business day and receive cashback on everyday business expenses like shipping and marketing. We also signed a new issuing agreement for small business credit. Next, our value-added services are helping us win. They help our clients innovate and grow, provide risk management solutions and drive better outcomes for them and, in turn, for Visa. Our acceptance solutions, including CyberSource, have really resonated with clients this year. We sold more than 2,600 new acceptance services in over 100 countries. In North America, Costco has chosen Visa Acceptance Solutions, including CyberSource, for all of their US and Canadian e-commerce transactions. Alaska Airlines has selected CyberSource to process their kiosk payments in support of their initiative to transform the airport lobby experience. In Asia Pacific, China Merchants Bank, the largest issuer in Mainland China has renewed its consumer and small business portfolios. In addition to our flagship risk management services, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, they will also expand their use of consulting services. Bank of China and Aon Financial Service in Japan have also signed on to use VAA and VRM. In Latin America, we have been focused on expanding our processing penetration as it allows us to offer more value-added services to our customers. In Colombia, we have recently expanded our processing penetration through the addition of four more banks under our strategic agreement with CredibanCo, the market's largest acquirer and issuer processor. This positions us to reach nearly 80% of domestic transactions by the end of FY 2024 from essentially zero in 2019. As part of these agreements, banks have added anywhere from four to 11 value-added services, including risk and acceptance services. As part of our network of networks strategy, we continue to both collaborate with and offer our solutions in the real-time payment space, most recently with FedNow. In Q4, Visa became a certified service provider for FedNow. Using our service, Visa financial institution clients can receive funds in real-time through the FedNow service with origination capabilities to follow. This means that Visa is now processing FedNow payments with the clearinghouse RTP to follow in the next few months. Now on to our new flows capabilities, which are increasingly an important differentiator to our clients. On the B2B side, we are pleased to have reached an expanded long-term global agreement across more than 60 countries with Citibank for their commercial card business, which also encompasses over 20 value-added services. We also recently won the IBM commercial card business spanning T&E, meeting and purchasing card programs in over 60 countries, also with Citibank as the issuer. In Singapore, we renewed our long-standing partnership with DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, to continue offering commercial debit and credit services for consumers and expanded into new commercial products for small businesses. On the Visa Direct side, we continue to expand Visa Direct's reach, especially to wallet endpoints. Most recently, we signed an agreement with Tencent for the Visa Direct cross-border remittance business. This will bring the total wallet reach for Visa Direct to over 2.5 billion. We have expanded our partnership with Paysend from US and UK payments to enable all of Paysend's customers across the globe to send money in real-time to eligible Visa cards across 170 countries and territories. Paysend is also a Currencycloud customer offering compelling cross-border solutions. We also recently renewed with the largest issuer in Korea, Shinhan Card, for consumer and business credit, which also incorporates the provision of our data capabilities in value-added services and the enablement of Visa Direct for cross-border remittances. We have also continued to add new Visa Direct use cases with our partners, such as with small ticket B2B payments and bill pay. In Brazil, Banco RB will enable Visa Direct for low-value, high-velocity cross-border payments as part of their corporate banking business. In the US, payment platform everywhere will be enabling bill payments with Visa Direct. And last but certainly not least, our brand. Visa's brand strength helps deliver added value to our clients and their customers, financial institutions, merchants and partners through a wide range of products and services as well as innovative brand and marketing efforts. We are pleased to have signed an agreement with Universal Destinations and Experiences to be the exclusive payment network for their new co-branded credit card that will be issued by FNBO. In addition, Visa is now the official way to pay at Universal Destinations and Experiences. And together, we will provide compelling benefits to Visa cardholders across their Orlando and Hollywood properties. Also in the US, we have recently renewed the Fidelity Investments co-brand credit portfolio issued by US Bank. And we signed with Coupang, a large retailer with 20 million customers in Korea for their inaugural co-brand card. And in CEMEA, we have signed a Saudi Airlines co-brand with Riyadh Bank, and we renewed our co-brand partnership with Etihad Guest, the loyalty program of Etihad Airways. As we look ahead, we're excited to be activating our brand with clients and partners at the Paris 2024 and Milano-Cortina 2026, Olympic and Paralympic Summer and Winter Games. Since 1986, Visa has been a proud sponsor of the Olympic Movement, which provides an unparalleled opportunity to promote the Visa brand at a regional and global level while also facilitating partnerships and joint business initiatives with clients. The games provide a unique platform for showcasing product innovation and engaging consumers and clients with exclusive experiences. We are looking forward to the upcoming games, and we have been building momentum in the business across Europe with a particular focus on the continent. I'll share a few recent highlights for our European business. On the people front, payments is a local business, and we have expanded into seven new locations over the past five years and have more than doubled our workforce in the market. On innovative products, we have well over 100 fintech relationships and have expanded our capabilities through the acquisitions of Tink and CurrencyCloud. In new flows, Visa Direct has more than 100 enablers and over 1,000 programs with transactions more than doubling over the past two years. And in value-added services, we have increased our client penetration. In VAA alone, the number of clients enrolled in the service has more than doubled since three years ago, and we will be introducing nearly 20 additional products in 2024. We have been steadily building an attractive position on the continent and have built a strong pipeline of signed deals for the future by competing uniquely in each market. Active cards across Continental Europe have grown nearly 50% since 2019. Over the next few years, we expect to migrate more than 40 million cards across nearly 40 clients. And the nature of the portfolios we are winning in Continental Europe tend to include more cross-border volume, resulting in higher yields. So our brand, our capabilities, our people, all of these make a difference for Visa's clients. 2023 had many milestones and solid financial performance. As we are now three weeks into our new fiscal year, I would like to make a few general points, and then Chris will go into more detail. One, there is still macro uncertainty, but just like in fiscal year 2023, I am confident that we can manage through it. Our strategy and focus remain the same: propelling growth across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Two, we are focused on delivering for our stockholders. In that light, I'm sure that you saw that we released an 8-K back in September regarding our potential exchange offer program. We appreciate the dialogue we've had with Class A, B and C stockholders and the board is evaluating next steps as we continue to engage with investors. Finally, you may have seen today that we announced a $25 billion multiyear share repurchase program, which reflects our Board's confidence in our strategy and future potential. I continue to see tremendous opportunity ahead. Visa has the brand, the capabilities, the strategy and, most importantly, the people to propel our growth for years to come. And with that, let me hand it over to Chris.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q4 was another good quarter, closing out a strong fiscal 2023 driven by healthy growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and process transactions and continued solid execution of our strategy, with new flows and value-added services revenue growing faster than consumer payments. I'll first start with a high-level summary of our Q4 performance and then click into more details. Looking at our drivers. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9% year-over-year and process transactions grew 10% year-over-year, both stable to Q3. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe growth was strong, up 18% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenues were up 11% and 10% in constant dollars, with minimal impact from FX, in line with our expectations. GAAP EPS was up 22% and non-GAAP EPS was up 21% in both nominal and constant dollars. Now, on to the details, starting with the US. Payments volume was up 6% year-over-year, stable to Q3. Credit volume grew 6% year-over-year and debit volume grew 7%. Card-present spend grew 3% and US card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9%. US process transactions growth was stable at 8%. Over the course of the quarter, we saw payments volume growth tick up from July to September, primarily driven by sequential improvement in ticket size growth that was mostly led by fuel with higher gas prices and easier year-over-year comparisons as well as a positive days mix impact. Consumer spend across all segments from high to low spend has remained stable since March. Our data did not indicate any behavior change across consumer segments. In international markets, total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars. Payments volume growth rates were strong through the quarter in most major regions with Latin America, CEMEA and Europe ex-UK growing about 20% or more in constant dollars. Now, to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars, excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 18% and up 152% versus 2019. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, grew 9% year-over-year and 173% versus 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, cross-border e-commerce spending grew year-over-year in the low double-digits, in line with pre-COVID growth rates and consistent with the trends we have seen for most of the fiscal year. Cross-border travel-related spend grew 26% year-over-year. The cross-border travel volume index to 2019 increased from 139% in June to 143% in September, totaling 141% for the quarter, a 5-point improvement from Q3. We continued to see healthy travel volume levels in and out of LAC, Europe and CEMEA, ranging from 145% to 165% of 2019 levels. Travel volume into Asia continued to improve, indexing at 128% to 2019 levels for the quarter, up 10 points from Q3, while travel volume out of Asia was up 7 points to 114%. Looking at Mainland China specifically, cross-border travel volume continued to improve but remain below 2019 levels. Travel volume outbound from the US to all geographies continued to be strong in the mid-150s indexed to 2019. US inbound travel recovery accelerated this quarter, pushing the index above 2019 levels for the first time even as the dollar continued to remain strong relative to pre-COVID levels. Now, let's review our fourth quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 12% year-over-year versus the 9% growth in Q3 constant dollar payments volume, primarily due to business mix, pricing and card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 13% versus 10% process transaction growth led by value-added services and pricing. International transaction revenues were up 10% versus the 18% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth lagged volume growth primarily due to declining currency volatility. Other revenues grew 35%, led by pricing, consulting and marketing services, and client incentives grew 20%. Now, let me dive into revenues growth across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by stability in domestic volume growth and process transactions as well as strong growth in cross-border volumes. New flows revenue grew 14% in constant dollars. Commercial volumes were up 9% in constant dollars and up 156% versus 2019. Remember that revenue is recorded based on last quarter's payment volumes growth, which was 9% in constant dollars in Q3. Visa Direct transactions grew 19% and as we mentioned last quarter, were impacted by a client that transitioned its domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system and that was not meaningful to revenue. Value-added services grew 19% in constant dollars, driven primarily by strong advisory services, select pricing actions and higher volume. GAAP operating expenses increased 13%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 9%, primarily due to personnel expenses from growth in headcount, and FX had a nearly 2-point drag. Excluding net gains from our equity investments of $7 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $79 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates. Our GAAP tax rate was 16.9% and non-GAAP was 17% due to a tax benefit related to the extension of the US foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in an indirect tax expense in the operating expense line and a much larger tax benefit in the income tax provision. GAAP EPS was $2.27. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.33, up 21% over last year, inclusive of a little more than 0.5 point of drag from exchange rates. In Q4, we bought back approximately $4.1 billion in stock and distributed $928 million in dividends to our stockholders. We also added $150 million to the litigation escrow account, which has the same effect as a stock buyback. At the end of September, we had $4.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. For the full fiscal year 2023, net revenues increased 11%. GAAP EPS of $8.28 was up 18% and non-GAAP EPS of $8.77 was up 17%, inclusive of an over 2-point drag from exchange rates. Now let's move to fiscal year 2024. Before we share our perspectives on the year, I want to make a few brief comments. In many ways, FY 2024 will be as close to a normal year as we've had in a while. We have fully lapped the Russia and Omicron impacts and overall inflation continues to moderate in many of our markets. As such, we're pleased to resume our pre-COVID guidance practices and will provide our outlook for FY 2024, which we will update each quarter. At the same time, we will no longer be providing the intra-quarter 8-Ks associated with interim driver updates. Now let's look at what we've seen through the first three weeks of October. US payment volume was up 5% with debit and credit both up 5%. The sequential step down from September was primarily driven by the days mix impact in September and declining fuel prices in October. Excluding those two items, payments volume growth was relatively stable from September to October. Reg II has not meaningfully impacted volumes so far. Process transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 19%, and travel-related cross-border volumes were 144% indexed to 2019. Turning now to our key assumptions. As we said consistently, we're not economic forecasters, and so at a macro level, we are assuming no recession in our outlook. We're also not factoring in any impact from Reg II and student loan repayments because as I mentioned before, we've yet to see any meaningful impact. As the year progresses and we gather more information with regard to these assumptions, we will continue to provide updates. For key drivers, we are assuming that the trends we saw in Q4 generally continue throughout the year. Overall payments volume growth and process transaction growth are expected to be in the low double-digits on a year-over-year basis. Cross-border, card-not-present ex travel and ex crypto volume growth will continue to be in the low double-digits year-over-year on a constant dollar basis. Cross-border travel volume, excluding intra-Europe, year-over-year growth will moderate to the low 20s in constant dollars and when compared to 2019 would equate to a 4- to 5-point improvement each quarter. This assumption is driven primarily by improving AP cross-border travel volume mostly from China and, to a lesser extent, improving US inbound travel volume. In terms of what this means for the financials, I'll speak to the numbers on an adjusted basis, which we define as non-GAAP results presented in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts, which you can review in the footnotes in our earnings release and earnings presentation for more detail. Okay. First, let's discuss net revenues. For the full year, we expect low double-digit adjusted net revenue growth. Based on current currency forward curves, FX will be approximately a 1-point drag for the year. We are assuming that currency volatility moderates slightly from Q4 levels but remains relatively stable throughout the year. On a year-over-year basis, incentives are expected to grow slightly less than what we saw in FY 2023. For new flows and value-added services, we continue to expect those to grow faster than consumer payments in FY 2024. Now moving to expenses. Our current plans are to grow adjusted operating expense in the high single-digit to low double-digits with approximately 1.5 points of FX benefit to nominal non-GAAP growth. Non-operating income is expected to be between $250 million and $300 million. The tax rate is expected to be slightly favorable to our typical rate of 19% to 19.5% due to some offsetting factors. On the one hand, we have the impact of tax rate increases in certain countries, which puts our new run rate closer to 19.5% to 20%. However, we also anticipate some onetime tax benefits in the second half related to the resolution of certain tax matters. In total, this will put us between 18.5% and 19% for the full fiscal year. Putting all this together, we expect full year adjusted EPS growth in the low teens with about 0.5 point of FX drag to nominal non-GAAP growth. Also FY 2024 will likely be a tale of two halves with variability in our growth rate from the first half to the second half. A few aspects to keep in mind. First, cross-border volume ex intra-Europe grew 31% year-over-year in the first half of FY 2023 and 20% in the second half. Second, recall that we had relatively high currency volatility in the first half of FY 2023, and it moderated considerably in the second half. Third, incentives were 16% higher in the second half of FY 2023 versus the first half due primarily to deal timing and client performance. As a result, we expect overall adjusted net revenue growth to be lower in the first half than in the second half of FY 2024. This will also be the case on a nominal basis, even with a slightly larger FX headwind in the second half of FY 2024 than the first half. On the expense side, as Ryan mentioned, this is an Olympics year, and we expect Q2 and Q3 expense to have the largest percentage increases as we ramp. But adjusted operating expense growth and the FX impact will roughly be the same in both half. The tax rate is expected to be lower in the second half than the first due to the anticipated onetime tax benefits I mentioned. So for the first quarter specifically, given the variables I just described, Q1 is expected to have the lowest adjusted year-over-year net revenues growth rate with an improving trend throughout the year, and Q4 is expected to be at the highest adjusted growth rate. We expect first quarter net revenues growth in the upper mid to high single digits on an adjusted basis. A few factors to keep in mind. Again, one, currency volatility was the highest in Q1 of 2023; two, cross-border volume grew 31% in Q1 of 2023; and three, Q1 2023 other revenue was strong due to FIFA World Cup related value-added services revenue, and incentives were lower than expected due to client performance and other items. Adjusted operating expense growth is expected to be in the high single digits, driven by headcount growth and salary increases. We anticipate approximately 0.5 point FX headwind to nominal net revenues growth and approximately 1.5 point benefit to nominal non-GAAP expense growth. The tax rate is expected to be closer to a new run rate of between 19.5% and 20% in Q1. This puts first quarter adjusted EPS growth in the upper mid-single digits with minimal impact from FX. Keep in mind that the adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results presented in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. And non-GAAP expenses and EPS exclude acquisition related items and the litigation provision for the first quarter of 2023. For FY 2024, the estimated results exclude approximately $20 million or $0.01 of acquisition-related costs and approximately $40 million or $0.02 from the amortization of acquired intangibles. And finally, moving to capital return. As Ryan said, the Board has authorized a $25 billion multiyear share repurchase program and increased our quarterly dividend by 16%. In summary, Visa's underlying business continues to be healthy and stable and the growth opportunities are significant. While there continue to be macro uncertainties, we feel confident in our ability to manage the business through a changing environment and deliver value for our stockholders. And now, Jennifer, let's move to Q&A.\nJennifer Como: Thanks Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hey guys. Thanks for the time and congrats on the quarter. Just when thinking about your guidance for the fiscal year ahead, it's good to see the constant currency double-digit growth rate. So, I just want to make sure we understand the inputs and how you think about structural growth as far as some of the inputs like value-added services, new flows? So, number one, I mean, maybe you can give us a little more color on what you're assuming for some of those -- some of the VAS and new flows growth potential? And then more importantly, do you believe that's the right algorithm medium term? Is the structural growth of this company sustainably yet at the same 10% to 12% rate it's been or has anything changed?\nChris Suh: Hi Darrin, yes, let me address that. This is Chris. So, yes, a couple of things I'll say about the FY 2024 guide. First, the underlying drivers, as we shared, both payments volume and process transactions will be growing in the low double-digits, which is very consistent and reflects the stable business trends that we see in the underlying drivers. I also said on the call commentary that we do expect VAS, value-added services, and new flows to continue to be our growth engine, growing faster than the consumer payments part of the business. And so I think that structure, which you described, is consistent in many ways to 2023, and that's what we certainly expect to see in 2024.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Koning: Yes, thanks so much. Good job. And I guess two quick ones. Asia-Pacific constant currency volume growth was 4%, a little lower than normal. Maybe you could dive into that. And then tax rate longer term, basically in the out years, 19.5% to 20%, that's how we should think about it? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Hey Dave, I'll talk about Asia and maybe put it in the context of what we're seeing around the world, and then Chris, you can take the tax rate. Just to answer your question specifically on Asia, as you said, growth ex-China slowed four points from Q3. There's a couple of things going on there. One is we're lapping some strong COVID ramp in Q4 of 2022, but we're also seeing a little softness in a couple of places, notably Australia, what I'd point you to. If you guys just kind of back up and look at that in kind of the bigger picture, what are we seeing around the world, outside of Asia, it sounds like you've looked at the numbers and you would have seen we're seeing resiliency. Outside of North America and Asia, if you look at Europe ex-UK, Latin America, CEMEA, most of these regions are growing at around 20% or more. So, we feel good about what's happening there. On the tax rate, Chris, I'll turn it over to you the long-term tax rate.\nChris Suh: Yes, sure. Hi, Dave. Yes, I do think that's the right way to think about it. At least based on what we know now, the new run rate, we would put at about 19.5% to 20%. It does -- it is related to how our tax -- the mix of our tax jurisdictions around the world and certain tax increases in certain parts of the world. As we talked about in the next fiscal year, we'll be below that due to some of the benefits that we anticipate in the second half of the year. But based on what we know today, the new run rate is as you estimated.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good to see the 19% growth in Visa Direct transactions, and in particular, the 65% growth in cross-border P2P transactions year-over-year. As we look to FY 2024, what are some of the biggest, most promising new use cases you're working on for Visa Direct?\nRyan McInerney: Hey, David. Cross-border remittances is a big one. Since you called that out, I'll highlight it. And I mentioned, I think, on this call and some others, the work we're doing with Paysend and Shinhan and things we're doing around the world we've mentioned in previous calls with some of the both kind of traditional and fintech remittance players. 65% year-over-year growth is strong and continue to invest behind that with new partners and try to drive further growth going forward. We're focused on bill payments. We're focused on earned wage access. We're focused on insurance disbursements. We continue to focus on P2P more broadly in new geographies around the world, both domestic and cross-border. If you just back up, I've said this, I think, on previous calls. I believe at this point in time, Visa Direct is the largest at-scale money movement network on the planet. We have made investments consistently year-over-year to get to a point where we now have 8.5 billion endpoints, 3 billion cards, 3 billion accounts with some of the news I announced in my prepared remarks, 2.5 billion digital wallets. And we'll continue to invest in expanding the network even further. But now we've got the ability to work with enablers around the world, sell new use cases in and put this network to work. And we're going to continue to do that and look forward to hopefully talking to you about more good results to come.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. You guys had a lot of great commentary on commercial and B2B progress and deal wins in the quarter. Can you just give us a broader update on your commercial strategy? Where do you see the bigger opportunities there going forward?\nRyan McInerney: Yes, thanks. It was -- we did have some really good commercial wins in the quarter. I'd put it in a couple of different buckets. One is we're looking to expand our partnerships, right? So I mentioned Citi and IBM this quarter. I mentioned SAP last quarter. And we're just -- we're having good success building and expanding those partnerships around the world. Second thing we're focused on is expanding verticals. You've heard us talk about government, travel, fleet and fuel. I talked about agro, I think, last quarter, working and selling into marketplaces, like I mentioned, healthcare. So taking these products, innovating, creating new use cases and delivering them into new verticals. And then just making the products easier to use. Yesterday, we announced that actually we had a new product to make it easier to accept virtual cards. We call it virtual card acceptance platform. Virtual cards are a preferred acceptance of many suppliers, but they're not as easy to accept as sometimes we'd like them to be. So putting new platforms out to make the core products like virtual cards easier to use. And then continuing to invest in the partnerships that we've announced over the last couple of years. WEX is a great example of a partner that we announced a couple of years ago that we've invested in and growing in and really getting to see some of the benefits of that around the world. So, I guess the last thing I would say, Ramsey, is just also taking these products more broadly around the world. In so many different countries outside of the most developed markets that we work in, there's opportunity to get some of the basic products into the hands of small businesses, for example. In a lot of countries we're doing business, there's still a lot of small businesses that are actually using consumer products instead of the more sophisticated advanced small business products, let alone the large and middle market products that we can get out there. So, more partners, more use cases, more verticals, more countries, we'll continue to invest in that business.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nWill Nance: Hi guys. Appreciate taking the question. You had some interesting commentary around processing market share gains. Wondering if you could just give us kind of a state of the union of where you stand with that. And if there's any geographies that are kind of top of mind as opportunities to increase processing share, what would those be? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yes, sure. I mean, we're very focused on processing share for a couple of reasons, but the one I noted in my prepared remarks is a very important one, which is we can deliver more of our value-added services when we're actually processing the transaction. Obviously, we earn more yield when we process the transaction as well, just on the core processing of it. But the ability to serve our clients more effectively, deliver them our risk capabilities, our issuing capabilities, our loyalty capabilities and those types of things are enhanced when we actually process the transaction. So, we spend a lot of time on it. I think we've made very good progress over the last many years. I mentioned Colombia in my prepared remarks, and Colombia is a good use case. In a lot of these markets, to really unlock the processing, we have to work with the local processor, which we did in Colombia and then worked with the clients to get them on that processor. They will then test out the transaction, see how they're working and ultimately move those transactions to VisaNet, which we like. We've been very focused in Latin America. We've made some good strides in several different countries in Latin America, and I think we continue to have opportunity in Latin America. We're making strides in Europe, and we'll continue to focus on processing opportunities in several of the different countries that have local schemes in Europe as well as some places in Asia-Pacific. So, those are some of the opportunities we have, Will. Thanks.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Good afternoon everybody. Just want to circle back on the travel component of cross-border and how you're thinking about that in the coming year. I can appreciate, as you guys have often said, you're not necessarily economic forecasters. But can you just repeat for us what your underlying assumption is for the coming year? And then maybe give a little bit of color on inputs of how you're arriving at that expectation and target for the year? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Let me give some context on how we think about just cross-border travel in general, and then, Chris, you can add and/or fill in the blanks on the assumptions that we've made for the year. Here's how we think about it. In and out of Asia, we still have yet to normalize. So, as Chris alluded to or said in his prepared remarks, we have opportunity to continue to catch up to pre-COVID travel levels in and out of Asia. There's also the opportunity to still catch up into the United States. But more broadly around the world, I would say we've got to normalize in terms of cross-border travel. But I think what's interesting is we've normalized at a growth rate higher than pre-pandemic levels. People are traveling international at this new normal at a faster rate than they would have been, all else equal, before the pre-COVID level. So in a couple of quarters, we still have an opportunity to catch up to what would be normalized levels. Around the rest of the corners around the world, I think we've normalized but at higher growth rates than we saw pre-COVID. Do you want to mention the numbers for the year?\nChris Suh: Sure. The only thing I'd really add and I covered a lot of the assumptions in the call commentary. The thing that I might just emphasize is that it is pretty healthy growth. And if you look at what we've shared in terms of what we expect the index to grow at four to five points a quarter, I think that does reflect what Ryan said, which is normalized in many cases and continuing to be elevated growth.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJamie Friedman: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Ryan, in your prepared remarks, you called out CyberSource. I know it's a very important asset for you and always has been. But why is -- am I inferring that there's an increased cadence in the business? And if so, why would that be? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yeah. As I said, Jamie, in my prepared remarks, we're seeing great strong client demand around the world for CyberSource. Why? I think it's a result of a lot of the investments we've made in the platform over the last several years. We've been very purposeful about investing in our omni-commerce capabilities for CyberSource. We've been very purposeful in investing in our tokenization capabilities, our risk management and fraud prevention capabilities. And a lot of that has been driven by sitting down with our clients and partners, understanding their road maps, understanding what they needed us to deliver, making those investments and then having success growing with our partners. And in any given market around the world, when clients start adopting the CyberSource platform and others look around at the success they're having with authorization rates or transaction success or others, that leads to new opportunities, and we've had the ability to sell into those. So thanks for the question.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I have a question on Reg II. Chris, you mentioned no impact yet and also caveated the outlook. I'm just wondering, is there anything that gives you pause there? And then, Ryan, anything you guys are doing proactively to get in front of any adverse impacts? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Why don't I talk just contextually about Reg II and then you can answer anything else on Sanjay's question? So two things going on, obviously, with Reg II, let's just talk about them both. One is the change that was made last summer that went into effect with regards to routing in the e-comm space. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks there, we haven't seen any meaningful impact. Having said that, there's a lot of work happening around the ecosystem and we're out there talking to clients and partners about our products and our value propositions, making sure they understand the benefits of a Visa transaction, especially in the e-commerce space, where often the merchant holds the fraud liability. So our sales teams are in with merchant clients and acquire clients day in and day out, explaining the value of our product, showing them the value of our products. And going forward, we feel good about our ability to compete. The second thing that's going on with Reg II that I'm sure people would have seen is the Fed has announced that they're going to, I think it's tomorrow, announce some changes potentially to the debit interchange rate in the US. We don't know what they're going to say. We'll obviously follow it very closely. And when they do publish something, we'll take a look and see if it merits a response on our behalf. And just as a reminder, interchange is the exchange value between the merchant and the issuer. And I think what's notable about our business model is we've proven that we can be resilient and have a strong business in regulated interchange markets, not regulated interchange markets, in markets that have higher regulated interchange and lower regulated interchange. So, as you alluded to, a lot going on in the US with Reg II, but we're all over it and we feel good about our ability to compete.\nChris Suh: Yes, and I'll just add on from a guidance perspective. Hopefully, we're very clear on the call, we have not seen any meaningful impact thus far, and therefore, haven't included any impact of that in our FY 2024 guidance. But it is early days and there's a lot going on, as Ryan described at length, and so we'll keep you posted as things evolve in the coming months.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question around tokenization and the implications for just broader-based authorization rate improvements, and this is not just like domestic but like international. It just feels like a lot of your partners are able to drive higher authorization rates as a result of the token. So, I'm just wondering how you're viewing that in the context of being able to drive incremental transactions back to Visa? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yes, thanks for the question. Just for a reminder for everyone, tokenization is technology that we use that essentially helps protect issuers, merchants and consumers, and to your question, ultimately, drives higher authorizations and lower fraud. I think I said in my prepared remarks, we crossed 7.5 billion tokens as of the end of September. We're in 198 markets. I think we have 14 billion token transactions in the fourth quarter, which is growing at like 60%. So, this is another example of a platform and a service that we invested in over many years and we're now scaling broadly around the world. To your question, we are. We're seeing, on average, somewhere between 4% and 5% higher approval rates across our partners. And we also see it with a reduction in fraud -- a 30% reduction in fraud. So, you say, why do we have 7.5 billion tokens that are now out there in the ecosystem? Well, if you're one of our partners, as you said, and you can reduce your fraud rates 30% and drive your auth rates four or five percentage points, that is a great opportunity. That's higher sales, that's lower fraud, that's better customer experience. And we continue to invest in that platform as well. We see a lot of benefits to our issuers, to our consumers who ultimately use the products. You'll see more from us enhancing the platform in terms of using the Fido biometrics and enabling merchants to be able to authorize and authenticate customers across multiple devices and those types of things. So, yes, higher auth, lower fraud. We love the platform, continue to invest in it.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTrevor Williams: Great. Thanks a lot. Chris, I wanted to clarify on incentives within the guide. I think you said you're assuming slightly slower growth than in fiscal 2023. Just want to make sure, is that year-over-year growth in dollars or as a percentage of gross revenue? And then just the second part to that. You're framing this as a more normal year. Should we be interpreting that as meaning all else equal, a normal year incentive should be going up kind of plus or minus 100 basis points as a percentage of gross revenue? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Hi, Jeff [ph]. Yeah, let me try to clarify a bit. As I said, 2024 is, in many ways, a normal year. It's still normalizing in some aspects, but in many ways, it is normalizing. And as a result, we've made some changes. We've returned to pre-COVID practices on a number of fronts. We provided formal guidance as you went through -- as we went through in detail, and we talked about on this call, for the full year and next quarter, and we'll continue that practice. And that guidance is on net revenue guide specifically and directional commentary about the growth in incentives, which to your specific question, it is a dollar year-over-year growth rate that we said will grow slower in 2024 relative to 2023. Importantly, this is very, very consistent and it's aligned with how we think about the business, how we manage the business going forward. We haven't guided on the percentage, which is the other part of your question because, again, this is consistent with how we manage the business. The thing that we do track very importantly is that we look at the yield across our net revenue yield specifically, and that's remained very stable, and that's very consistent again with how we think about deal economics.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks. I'm actually at Money20/20, is really good energy here. I'm curious, Ryan, if you'd characterize the deal pipeline as being any different than what it was a year ago. How does that feel to you? And if you don't mind me asking just on the credential side, I think you said up 7%. I'm curious same thing, is pipeline there to support that same high single digit growth in fiscal 2024, credentials? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Hi, Tien-Tsin. Glad there's great energy at Money20/20, and I hope my Visa team members that are there are serving clients, finding sales opportunities growing our business. Yeah, we see a great pipeline. We really do with clients issuing, fintechs, co-brands, with opportunities to grow credentials. I mentioned some of the new things on my prepared remarks. And we're having good success. I think just some of the wins on the call, whether it's Citi or US Bank, FNBO, Fidelity, Shinhan, China Merchants Bank, Shopify, I mean, list goes on, right? IBM, DBS, Etihad, Saudi. We feel good about the pipeline. We feel good about the way our teams are out there serving clients around the world. We feel good about the wins that we have and feel good about the growth that it's generating.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Hi, Ryan. Hi, Chris. Congratulations on the quarter. Questions on open banking, CFPB obviously proposed a rule to jump-start competition, shift to open banking a few days back. You guys have dealt with open banking frameworks outside the US in many different geographies. Just kind of curious how that translates in terms of products, in terms of acquisitions you made like Tink, Pismo and so on, to bring that over to the US?\nRyan McInerney: Thanks for the question. I think the CFPB rule that they put out is good for Americans. I think it's great for clarifying the structure and the regulatory framework here in America. I think it's likely to be a catalyst for growth of open banking in the United States, is it gives clarity to all the various different players in the ecosystem. If you think about it, like, it's a great opportunity for Americans to be able to put their own data to work in different types of digital tools that will help their own personal financial management, help them manage their financial lives better, get a better view of their finances across multiple different providers. And then to your point, we've seen different regulatory frameworks in different markets around the world. Our Tink business continues to perform very well in Europe, which obviously was one of the leaders in terms of establishing a regulatory framework for open banking. And we look forward to the opportunity to bring Tink outside of Europe. So when we look at the proposed rules here in the US, we welcome that because we want to understand what the regulatory expectations are so that we can build a business that will thrive and serve our clients and serve consumers effectively. So thanks for the question.\nJennifer Como: Last question, Jordan\nOperator: Our final question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon. As you're looking into the next fiscal year and beyond, I want to ask about the cash digitization opportunity in your growth to drive [ph] business. As you know, this is always a persistent question for Visa investors and thinking about it again, given the pandemic moving forward and during inflation tailwinds. So how are you thinking about the runway especially segmenting it between developed markets and also EM a little bit more competition? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. Thanks for the question. We continue to be excited about the cash, check digitization opportunity around the world. We continue to digitize cash and check around the world, and economies continue to grow around the world. So I think continues to surprise many people when they look at developed markets like the United States, how much cash and check still exists. And certainly, when you look to the developing world, how much cash and checks still exist. So we continue to be excited about the runway. We think it offers us tremendous growth opportunity. And we're going to continue to work with our partners across the ecosystem to get more credentials into consumers' hands, get more acceptance out there in the ecosystem, especially among micro and nano merchants and work with our partners to drive more activation and usage among the credentials and feel good about that entire algorithm.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Visa\u2019s fiscal third quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; Vasant Prabhu, Visa\u2019s Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Suh, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Designate. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC\u2019s website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today\u2019s earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our financial performance in the third quarter of 2023 was strong, with net revenues up 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was $2.16, up 9%. Overall, our global quarterly payments volume was up 9% year-over-year. In the U.S., quarterly payments volume was up 6%, as expected, primarily due to moderating inflation. Outside the U.S., international payments volume was up 12%. Excluding intra-Europe, total cross-border volume remained strong, up 22%, with cross-border travel volume at 136% of 2019. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. As I mentioned on our previous earnings call, my priorities are focused on doing everything that we can to accelerate our growth by executing our strategy, including supporting our go-to-market teams, delivering for our clients, shipping innovative products even faster and selling our solutions even more effectively. With those priorities in mind, I would like to review our progress across our three growth levers: consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. We continue to make great strides growing and expanding our consumer payments business, winning with new and existing clients and shifting volume to Visa from a wide array of local, regional and global competitors around the world. Our clients tell us they\u2019re choosing to deepen and expand their partnerships with us for a number of reasons, including our people, our products, our value-added services, our new flows and our brand. I\u2019ll share a few examples. First, our people. We consistently hear from our clients that they deeply value the advice, local support and partnership they receive day in and day out from our outstanding team members around the world. They also appreciate our thoughtful industry leadership on important and complicated issues across the ecosystem. In fact, in our latest global Net Promoter Score survey, our clients rated us at 73. In the U.S., we retained our position of serving 8 of the top 10 credit unions by recently renewing one of the largest players in the space, Pentagon Federal Credit Union. While there are many reasons for our success with PenFed, our people and our local market relationship model made the difference, just like it has for over 350 U.S. community bank and credit union renewals this year to date. Payments is a local business, and our priority to invest locally with great talent has paid off. For example, across Eastern Europe, Intesa Sanpaolo will issue Visa debit in Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia representing over 3 million Visa credentials. Second, our payment products and innovations consistently help us win. Our clients tell us they choose Visa because our innovative products help ensure they are delivering leading-edge payment solutions to their customers. For example, in Korea, we recently renewed our partnership with Hyundai Card. As part of our new partnership, Hyundai will be taking advantage of our digital payment solutions like data and analytics services to launch a series of new innovations. Hyundai will grow their share of Visa cards in credit and debit for consumer and business. Our innovation also comes from targeted value propositions in traditional products, and we are very pleased to have signed a new long-term partnership with the NatWest Group for consumer debit and credit. Third, our value-added services are helping us win in consumer payments. Our value-added services, such as consulting and analytics, AI-driven data solutions, risk solutions and processing, are a critical differentiator that helps our clients innovate and grow, often without having to use their most scarce resources: technology and engineering. For example, Rakuten Card, a subsidiary of Rakuten Group, which operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in Japan, has signed a new credit deal with Visa to further their strategy to become a top global player. As part of our partnership, Rakuten Card will utilize Visa\u2019s processing capabilities and dedicated Visa consulting, data science and analytics teams to support them on strategic initiatives. Fourth, our new flows capabilities. Increasingly, our new flows capabilities such as Visa Direct are an important differentiator to our clients when they\u2019re making consumer payments decisions. A great example is Cash App, with 53 million monthly transacting actives, Cash App has renewed and expanded agreement globally, encompassing card issuance, Visa Direct and value-added services. And last, but certainly not least, our brand. In many cases, our clients ask their customers, which brand do you prefer? Would you spend more if we issued this brand or that brand? And our clients consistently tell us that consumers overwhelmingly prefer Visa. We see this particularly play out with co-brands. For example, for many of the largest airline co-brands in the world, we remain a partner of choice, and we recently renewed with Korean Air and signed a new agreement with Breeze Airways. We also won a co-brand portfolio with Allegiant Travel Company, the parent company of Allegiant Air. In addition, in Latin America, we expanded our relationship with LifeMiles, Avianca\u2019s frequent flyer program from our existing portfolios in 9 countries with 18 issuing banks to an additional 4 countries in the Caribbean region. And finally, we signed a co-brand agreement with Indian conglomerate, Adani, serving 400 million customers through retail, airports and online travel services, among others. Let me now turn to new flows, again, with a focus on how effectively we are delivering on our priorities. Total new flows revenue was up 20% in constant dollars. Commercial volumes increased 9% in constant dollars to total $405 billion. In terms of how we go to market, we are focused on adding commercial products to our existing consumer relationships. KBank, a leading bank in Thailand, has renewed its relationship across debit and co-brand as well as signing a new deal to launch a new business debit card to serve SMEs and micro businesses. PagSeguro, a key Brazilian fintech client, already leveraging our consumer credit and prepaid and commercial prepaid products will expand in the commercial space with the launch of Visa Business Credit for their base of 28 million clients. As we do in the consumer space, we are also constantly working with commercial clients as a strategic partner to develop and deploy unique and innovative solutions. A recent example is with SAP, the global market leader in enterprise application software, which has signed a deal with us across multiple countries in Asia Pacific. We will integrate Visa\u2019s virtual card and business solution payment provider capabilities into SAP\u2019s business technology platform. SAP serves more than 46,000 customers across Asia-Pacific. This deal will create an embedded finance solution for their customers to make B2B payments, helping to improve their working capital positions and enhance their supply chains. For Visa Direct, third quarter transactions grew 20% and were $1.8 billion. In Latin America, we had a bank client transition its onus domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system. And while it could be impactful to our transactions over the next several quarters, the impact to revenue is expected to be minimal. At the same time, for their other transactions, this client will continue to utilize our interoperability capabilities provided by YellowPepper. I am very excited about Visa Direct, particularly as we enter new markets and increase our cross-border presence. Recently, we have expanded or entered several key markets, including in France, with Lydia, the leading P2P provider with over 7 million users. We renewed our issuance relationship, and we have signed a Visa Direct deal to enable their users to top up their wallets using an eligible card. In Bolivia, with fintech lib\u00e9lula\u2019s new app called Lula, Visa Direct will be enabling domestic P2P transactions within the app, and YellowPepper will be providing alias directory services. In Mexico, with fintech Alchemy Pay, Visa Direct will enable B2B cross-border supplier payments for thousands of SME clients in industries, including textiles, software, hardware and electronics across multiple corridors. And we\u2019ve also continued to expand corridors with important cross-border partners. For example, Revolut, with over 30 million users, has expanded its remittance service with Visa Direct to 89 markets after just launching in July of 2022. Similarly, TransferGo, a cross-border provider in the UK, serving 6 million customers, have expanded its Visa Direct-enabled corridors from 32 in 2020 to over 160. New flows continue to be an important part of Visa\u2019s growth story and our teams are effectively selling and activating our solutions. Now I will touch on value-added services. Our go-to-market approach remains focused on three growth areas: deepening client penetration of existing products, expanding geographically and building and launching new solutions. Unlike our core business, our growth in value-added services is often driven by selling a larger number of smaller solutions. This quarter, we succeeded in selling more than 300 new issuing services, 600 new acceptance services and almost 500 new risk and identity services, in some cases, even within the same client. Our sales teams continue to work day in and day out with our clients to understand and resolve their pain points and realize new growth opportunities. Altogether, in the third quarter, we generated $1.8 billion in value-added services revenue, up 19% in constant dollars. A couple of examples of new value-added services to highlight this quarter. First, our partnership with Pay.UK, the account-to-account payments operator in the UK was recently announced. We will be piloting our new fraud capability, RTP Prevent, which is uniquely built for instant payments with deep learning AI models. Using RTP Prevent, we can provide a risk score in real time so banks can decide whether to approve or reject the transaction on an RTP network. This is a great example of building and deploying entirely new solutions and our network of network strategy. Second, our recent announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire cloud native issuer processing and core banking platform, Pismo. We believe that Pismo will allow us to strategically serve our clients through additional capabilities, with core banking ledger and issuer processing through cloud-native APIs; additional geographies with operations in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe; and additional products with credit, debit, prepaid and commercial cards as well as connections to local networks, including PICs in Brazil. From a network perspective, issuer processing and core banking have become important elements to support issuers, activate card credentials and distribute value-added services. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and approvals and is expected to close by the end of 2023. To wrap up, over the last few months, I have traveled across the globe meeting with clients, partners and regulators, and I continue to see enormous opportunity and momentum. Our brand capabilities, innovation and partnership approach continue to position us well for Visa\u2019s future growth, but the most important aspect is our people. And with that in mind, I would like to welcome the newest member of our executive team, Chris Suh, who will become Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer on August 1. Chris brings to Visa more than 25 years of finance leadership experience from global high-growth companies. His deep experience in finance and technology, plus his leadership in growing and scaling businesses, will be extraordinarily valuable to us as we continue to drive growth and better serve our clients and customers around the world. Plus, as I am sure you will soon learn, Chris is a real hands-on business builder with a passion for technology and an intense focus on people who will fit in well with the culture of Visa. I\u2019ve asked Chris to join the Q&A portion of our call today, but please remember he isn\u2019t our CFO for a few more days. Before the Q&A, let me hand it over to Vasant to provide financial highlights for the quarter and our thoughts on the rest of the year. But first, Vasant, I know I speak on behalf of all of Visa and our investors that we are deeply grateful to you for your outstanding strategic and financial leadership. I have worked shoulder to shoulder with Vasant for the past 8 years, and I continue to be in awe of him. He is a world class CFO. And if there is a CFO Hall of Fame, I am confident he will be a first ballot inductee. Vasant, we wish you all the best. So for likely the last time on an earnings call in your career, over to you, Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon everyone. Fiscal third quarter net revenues were up 12% and GAAP EPS, up 25%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 9%. In constant dollars, net revenues grew 13%, and non-GAAP EPS grew 11%. We have now lapped the impact of Russia. A few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9%. Index to 2019, global payments volume was up 48%. U.S. payments volume was up 6% year-over-year, consistent with expectations and stable since March. Transactions growth has remained steady at pre-COVID levels of 8%. Average ticket size is down 2%, largely due to declining fuel prices and the general moderation of inflation across multiple categories. Relative to 2019, U.S. payments volume was up 54%. International payments volume growth was up 12%. The uptick in international payments volume since the last quarter is the result of lapping the discontinuation of Russian operations. Relative to 2019, international payments volume was up 43%. The cross-border travel recovery continues at the pace we expected with volume ex intra-Europe indexing at 1.36 versus 4 years ago, a 6 point improvement from the second quarter. Summer travel across most regions picked up, with travel in and out of Asia seeing strong gains, along with travel inbound to CEMEA and outbound from Europe. Travel into the U.S. is still hovering at 2019 levels. Our new flows and value-added services businesses continued to grow at almost 20% in constant dollars. In the third quarter, we bought back approximately $3 billion in stock at an average cost of $229.19 and distributed $937 million in dividends. We also added $500 million to the litigation escrow account, which has the same effect as a stock buyback. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 5% year-over-year. Debit grew 6%, generally in line with March growth rates post the uptick in January and February due to lapping of Omicron in 2022. U.S. card present spend grew 3%. Adjusted for fuel, which saw a significant price increase last year, U.S. card presence spend was up 5%. U.S. card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 8%. U.S. processed transactions growth was stable at 8%. The step-down in U.S. payments volume growth since March was driven by a 2% decline in average ticket size. When we look at spend by category, ticket sizes are declining most significantly in fuel and, to a lesser extent, in retail goods, travel and food and drug. As you know, fuel prices spiked last year due to the Ukraine war. Travel prices spiked as the world reopened post Omicron. Goods prices spiked due to supply chain bottlenecks and commodity inflation. Excluding these four categories average ticket size growth is positive. Consumer spend across all spend bands from affluent to low spend remained stable since March. Our data did not indicate any behavior change across consumer segments. Putting all this together, we continue to believe that the primary driver of the step-down in U.S. payments volume growth since March is moderating inflation and that the consumer has remained resilient so far. Moving on to international markets. In constant dollars, international payments volume growth rates were strong through the quarter in the major markets. Latin America was up 20%. Our CEMEA region grew 28%. We\u2019re now lapping the impact of Russia. Europe was up 10%. Excluding the UK, Europe volumes grew 23%. Asia Pacific, excluding China, grew 12%. Global process transactions were up 10%. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, were up 22% year-over-year, up 49% versus 4 years ago. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 9% year-over-year and 74% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, cross-border e-commerce spending grew year-over-year in the low double digits, in line with pre-COVID growth rates. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 34% year-over-year. The cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe index to 4 years ago, went from 134 in March to 139 in June. Travel into Asia continued to improve, indexing at 118 for the quarter, up more than 10 points from Q2, while travel out of Asia was up almost 10 points to 107. Looking at Mainland China specifically, cross-border travel continued to improve but remains well below 2019 levels. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continue to be strong in the mid-150s index to 2019. The inbound travel recovery remains sluggish, still just under 2019 levels. While some of the mitigating factors eased this quarter, the dollar remained quite strong relative to pre-COVID levels. In Europe, excluding intra-Europe, inbound and outbound travel remains robust with the index for 2019 in the low 140s for outbound, improving 10 points from the second quarter, and in the low 150s for inbound. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean also remained very strong, indexing in the low 160s to 2019 levels. Travel out of CEMEA indexed in the 140s versus 4 years ago, and inbound improved more than 10 points to the low 160s. Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 15% versus the 10% growth in second quarter constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was more than offset by business mix and pricing. As a reminder, third quarter service fees reflect second quarter payments volume growth, which was helped by lapping Omicron in fiscal year \u201822. Data processing revenues grew 15% versus 10% processed transactions growth. They have fully lapped the Russia impact, and the key drivers of performance were value-added services and pricing. International transaction revenues were up 14% versus a 22% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth lagged volume growth primarily due to declining currency volatility and exchange rate shifts. Other revenues grew 15% led by pricing, consulting services and card benefits. Client incentives were 28.1% of gross revenues, in line with our expectations. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by stability in domestic volume growth and transactions as well as growth in cross-border volumes. New flows revenue grew 20% in constant dollars. Commercial volumes were up 9% in constant dollars and 58% over 4 years ago. Visa Direct transactions grew 20%, and as Ryan mentioned, were impacted by a bank client that transitioned its domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system. While it could be impactful to transactions over the next several quarters, the impact to revenue is expected to be minimal. Value-added services revenue grew 19% in constant dollars driven by higher volume, strong advisory services and select pricing actions. GAAP operating expenses decreased 1%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 10%, driven primarily by personnel expenses from headcount additions over the past year. Excluding gains from our equity investments of $85 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $37 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates. Our GAAP tax rate was 19.2%, and non-GAAP was 19.4%. GAAP EPS was $2. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.16, up 9% over last year, inclusive of a nearly 1.5 point drag from the strong dollar. We have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Pismo for $1 billion in cash, subject to customary closing conditions. We will keep you posted on closing timing and financial impact. In May, we upsized our revolving credit facility to $7 billion and renewed it for 5 years. Through the first 3 weeks of July, U.S. payments volume was up 6%, with debit up 6% and credit up 6%. Compared to 4 years ago, they are up 56%, 65% and 47%, respectively. REG II has not measurably impacted volumes so far. In several key markets around the world, growth was in line with the third quarter. Process transactions grew 10% year-over-year and up 54% about 4 years ago. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 20% and was 51% about 4 years ago. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 72% about 4 years ago. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 41% over 4 years ago. Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Growth in domestic payments volumes remained stable around the globe. As such, we\u2019re assuming recent trends will sustain in the U.S. and key international markets for the rest of the quarter. On the cross-border front, the travel recovery trend has been steady and generally in line with our expectations so far for fiscal year \u201823. The cross-border travel index to 2019, excluding intra-Europe, has been improving at a rate of 5 to 6 points each quarter. We are assuming this pace of recovery continues into the fourth quarter. The region to monitor closely is Asia, especially travel in and out of Mainland China. On the cross-border e-commerce front, we\u2019re also assuming recent trends continue adjusted for crypto-related volatility. It is important to note that just as we saw in the third quarter, even as the cross-border business continues to recover relative to 2019, the year-over-year growth rate will continue to slow down. Also, currency volatility is moderating, and we are now lapping very high currency volatility from the fourth quarter last year. Our value-added services and new flows businesses have grown much faster than our consumer payments business. Sustaining faster growth rates for these businesses remains a critical priority. In the fourth quarter, we expect incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be between 27.5% to 28.5% to finish the year at the high end of the 26.5% to 27.5% range. When you pull all this together, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth of around 10% in nominal dollars with minimal impact from exchange rate shifts. The sequential slowdown is driven by three factors: the quarter lag in recognizing service fees, the expected slowdown in cross-border growth and moderating currency volatility lapping very high levels reached last year. As we indicated previously, non-GAAP operating expense growth in Q4 will likely be another 2 to 3 points lower than Q3. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items from the fourth quarter last year. Non-operating income will continue to benefit from the attractive rates we\u2019re earning on our cash balances. Interest income from cash will more than offset interest expense from debt by around $30 million in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in Q4. Assuming the performance expected in the fourth quarter, we will deliver low double-digit net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in fiscal year \u201823 despite concerns about a slowdown and an exchange rate drag. This once again demonstrates the resilience of our business, the large opportunity that remains available to digitize cash globally and the opportunity to accelerate our growth by developing vast new use cases while layering on additional value-added services. To finish, this will be my last earnings call as CFO of Visa. I want to thank all of you for your trust and support. At all times, you kept us on our toes with our nose to the grindstone. Hopefully, we\u2019ve delivered for you. This is also my last call as a public company CFO. I started this journey in September 2000, almost exactly 23 years ago. To use a cricketing term some of you will understand, I did not hit a century of earnings calls. I fell as I entered the \u201890s. On October 1, I will be switching over to your side as a shareholder of Visa, cheering from the stands as Ryan, Chris and the team lead Visa to another double and triple. Thank you, Ryan. We\u2019ve had a great run together. It\u2019s over to you, Chris. I\u2019m going to miss my finance team and the wonderful people of Visa. And as far as the CFO Hall of Fame goes, I\u2019m sure no CFO would invest in that business proposition. And now, Jennifer, it\u2019s time for some Q&A.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Vasant. And with that, we\u2019re ready to take questions, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon, thank you for taking my question. I want to ask about the Block lawsuit. They have been close partner of yours and all the issuers of Cash App, Visa cards on which they ought to benefit from interchange. And Ryan, you talked about the current partnership there. Any comments you have on the lawsuit will be helpful. And also just broadly, how should we think about the relationships with fin-tech and Cash App. Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. Thanks for the question. We have a wonderful relationship with Block, a deep partnership across many different elements, as I mentioned. As it relates to the lawsuit, there was some confusion in the market by the lawsuit. There is really nothing new here. The lawsuit is included in the MDL 1720. And thus, the lawsuit itself is covered litigation under our share class structure. So I would really put it in the category of nothing new here. And all the way back to the beginning of your question, we deeply value our relationship with Block and feel great about the deep and extended partnership we have with them.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan? \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. Good evening. I wanted to just touch base real quickly on value-added services from the standpoint of penetration for a second. I think it\u2019s around 20% or so of the company\u2019s net revenues. It\u2019s clearly yield enhancing. So it seems like a pretty large business. But Ryan, every time you talk about it, it sounds like there is so much room for growth, and it\u2019s hard for us to kind of pinpoint where you are in terms of penetration within your existing business. So any way you could frame that either anecdotally or quantitatively would be great. Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. Thanks for the question. I mean the truth is we are at the beginning of the journey across all of our value-added services businesses. They all have enormous TAM. We all have \u2013 they have enormous runway in terms of the opportunity to continue to penetrate. Our Acceptance Solutions business, whether it\u2019s CyberSource or Verifi or Visa Acceptance Cloud, I mean enormous amount of runway there. In issuing, we\u2019ve talked about the opportunity we have now with Pismo when we close on that deal, and the same thing with DPS risk and identity advisory. I mean it really is \u2013 they are all businesses that have enormous TAM. We\u2019re in the very early innings of our penetration, and we don\u2019t see in any of those businesses anywhere close to running out of runway anytime.\nDan Perlin: Thank you.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Your line is open.\nJennifer Como: Craig, are you there? \nCraig Maurer: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry, wasn\u2019t quick enough on the unmute button. So I wanted to ask about the loss of what I think I heard was a Visa Direct client in LatAm and why the transition to an internal system for them. And that leads to my follow-on which is, can you discuss the trends you\u2019re seeing globally in terms of domestic payments moving away from or back to domestic networks? Your comments in the beginning of the call seemed to indicate that there might be an acceleration toward the global networks to take advantage of what has clearly been greater investment levels into the capabilities. Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Craig, thanks for the two questions. I\u2019ll take the second one first. We are continuing to see the benefits of our investment all around the world. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing issuers, consumers shift share to Visa, shift their preference to Visa. And it happens in different ways in different countries versus the domestic schemes. But it is coming back to what you said, which is our ability to consistently invest in security features and tokenization and new digital use cases, we believe, is what\u2019s helping us win in that space. If you go back to the first part of your question, these types of things are going to happen when you\u2019re building out a new platform like we are in Visa Direct. It\u2019s still the very early days of building out Visa Direct. We\u2019re expanding in geographies and use cases. And as different partners use Visa Direct and they start to try it for different use cases, they\u2019ll find some of them work great. And other ones, they\u2019ll find opportunities to use it differently. In the case of the situation in Latin America that I mentioned, they started the journey of what they were working on using Visa Direct. They found it to be a more efficient way to get going in their journey, and then they found that they built an internal ledger system that they didn\u2019t have originally. But as I mentioned, they are going to continue to use our services for a number of things that they do. And listen, I think as we all talk over the coming quarters and years as we build out this platform, there is going to be ebbs and flows. There is going to be use cases that grow faster than others and things that stick and others that don\u2019t, and that\u2019s what building a new global business that has the reach of our platform is going to have.\nCraig Maurer: Thanks, Ryan.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. And congratulations, Vasant. Despite the concerns of choppy economy and disinflation, Vasant, you mentioned when we look at the July trends, and obviously, the trends in general over the course of the year, they have been very encouraging. And you mentioned the different categories. But as we look across the next 12 months, anything to parse out or think about in terms of the comps or how you see things playing out as we get maybe preliminary views on 2024?\nVasant Prabhu: Thanks, Sanjay. Yes. I mean the general term we\u2019ve used all along is stability, and we think things are still very stable. You look at transactions growth, it\u2019s been very stable in the U.S., around 8%. If you just adjust for the Omicron uptick we had last quarter, and you go back to pre-COVID trends or first quarter trends, transactions growth has been very stable. Clearly, some of the change in trends we pointed to ticket size. I don\u2019t think I want to get into talking about next year. We will leave that to Ryan and Chris in October, which is when we normally do talk about next year. But more \u2013 in the more near-term, the fourth quarter, the biggest hit to ticket size has been fuel, and fuel comparisons are going to moderate. And so that should help us a bit in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s reflected in our expectations. In general, I would say the trends we\u2019re seeing across the board are unchanged from where they have been for the past several months.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks. Vasant, best of luck to you. I wanted to actually ask about surcharging. I know Visa recently lowered the cap on the credit card surcharging to 3% from 4%. Just wanted to know, is this in response to a trend of more merchants employing surcharges, whether that might be in a compliant or a non-compliant manner? If so, are there any implications for Visa we should be considering from surcharging?\nRyan McInerney: No implications you should be considering. It won\u2019t surprise you, we don\u2019t feel great that consumers get surcharge. But of course, in certain jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, merchants have the ability to do that, and some choose to do it. Many choose to do it, and then they choose to pull back on it because it\u2019s not a great customer experience. The small adjustment that we made that you referenced was one. Just making sure that when consumers do get surcharge, it\u2019s something that\u2019s fair and equitable, and that was the purpose of the change.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Vasant, since it\u2019s your last earnings call, I got to ask you about incentives. You got to go out on an incentives question, at least. So as incentives look like they are going to be towards the higher end of the range, just the puts and takes that pushed it towards the high end. Was there more deal activity this fiscal year or different volumes that changed the incentives towards the high end?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 well, thanks for saying those nice things. I \u2013 in general, on incentives, they were in line with what we expected. So there were no surprises there. And incentives, everybody focuses on the percentage. If you look at what really counts, which is net revenue growth, we had healthy net revenue growth in the quarter. Even with the exchange rate drag, we were almost 12%, and the exchange rate drag would have added another point. If you look at yields, net revenue yields are higher than they were a year ago. We did have some renewals happen earlier than we expected. So we did have some renewals come into this year and Q3 that we might have thought would happen next year, but we\u2019re happy about that. We\u2019re always happy to renew clients even if we have to do it a little earlier. So all in all, no surprises there.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and welcome, Chris. And Vasant, you will be missed. I wanted to follow-up on the prepared remarks call-out on the partnership with Pay.UK around RTP Prevent. Can you elaborate a bit more on that? These are the types of value-added services I know we have all been eagerly waiting to see. So, can you talk a little more about sort of what the scope is of the pilot and exactly how that service works and how you will be monetizing it, if not in the pilot, then over the longer term? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Hi Lisa. Yes, thanks. So, it is one of the things we have been talking about is how we can build value-added services for new networks, specifically for RTP as it starts to grow and expand around the world. So, I guess how it works to the core of your question. So, first of all, what we have done is we have built a real-time risk score. We have built it uniquely for instant payments, where there is often unique cases of fraud in terms of how they work. We built it using deep learning AI models. And what it does is it enables banks to be able to decide whether to approve or reject the transaction in real time, which is the capability that most banks or most real-time payments networks around the world have been very hungry for. It\u2019s a score from 1 to 99. It comes with an instant real-time code that explains the score. And what it does is it leverages our proprietary data that kind of we have used to enhance our own risk algorithms as well as the data that we see on a lot of our payment platforms, including Visa Direct. And one of the benefits of us bringing that to market is it integrates with the bank\u2019s existing fraud and risk tools. Because we are often providing these types of risk scores to banks and they are ingesting them from us, it directly integrates into their fraud and risk tools, so the real-time information, their systems know how to use it. It can be automated into their decisioning algorithms and those types of things. So, think about it \u2013 if you back way up, if you think about it, it\u2019s similar to our Visa Advanced Authorization service that we offer on VisaNet. But we have built from the bottoms up, clean sheet of paper, a customized solution, leveraging deep learning AI models and integrated that directly into the bank system so that they can ingest that in real time. The pilot is just getting going. It\u2019s very early days, so we will report back as we learn more. And hopefully, we will have more examples like this to talk about around the world.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you and congratulations, gentlemen. Also Chris, welcome and Vasant, thank you for your help and partnership over the years. I wanted to ask about value-added services. Revenue yield there was quite solid and wanted to ask what\u2019s leading to that. Would you call it sort of structural at this point, or is it more episodic? Like in the past, you had benefits from, say, FX volatility or incentives, things like that. So, that\u2019s the question.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. FX volatility would not affect value-added services. We don\u2019t count our treasury revenues in value-added services. So, value-added services are benefiting from structural and secular things. First, it\u2019s deepening our penetration of existing clients. So, it\u2019s a concerted effort to sell more services to existing clients. Second is some of the services were not operating globally. We are now making these services available around the world. So, it allows us to clearly increase the scope of the market. And then third, as you know, we have been adding services over time. So, this is a long-term growth engine for us. Our goal is to continue to grow it at a very hefty clip. And think about it as, to get a transaction and the more services you can layer on and the more value you can add to the transaction, the more yield you can get on it. So, it\u2019s very much a growth engine, one of three, and we think it can grow for a very long time.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nKen Suchoski: Hi. Good evening everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about cross-border. Obviously, Visa is shaking some headwinds on the yield side in this business. Can you just talk about how much more of a headwind you think this is going to be in fiscal 4Q and fiscal 1Q of next year compared to what we saw this past quarter? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. So, just to correct, the way to think about value-added services yield, and I know you are looking at the revenue and dividing it by the volume, is there the yield on the transaction and then there is the yield on the exchange rate translation services we provide. Where the yield has gone down, because it was very high last year, is on the exchange rate translation service, what we call our treasury revenues, because currency volatility last year was 30% to 40% higher than it is right now. Currency volatility right now is a little higher than the long-term average. But last year, it was at extraordinary highs. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we will lap some of the highest levels of currency volatility reached last year. And based on where volatilities are today versus last year, volatilities are down almost 40%. So, it\u2019s a sizable move. So, any yield difference you see in that line is because of treasury revenues. It\u2019s not from our core cross-border yields, which remain very steady. It\u2019s going to fluctuate based on currency volatility. And really, it\u2019s still decent. It\u2019s just that it was very high last year.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hi guys. Thank you. Visa right now is net cash for the first time, I think since 2016, since pre the Visa Europe deal, and gross debt below 1x. I know your target generally is 1x to 1.5x. And the buyback, frankly, was a little bit light also tracking at about 76%. Last year, you paid out about 76% of net income and buybacks. So, I think you need to do a pretty big catch-up in this quarter. So, just curious to hear how you are thinking about capital allocation. I guess Ryan, the multiple is lower versus the market has been in a while. Do you see this as a good opportunity for buybacks to pick up pace, or are there other reasons why you would want to allocate capital different ways, guys? Thanks again.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I will start and maybe Ryan can add. No, there is no change in capital allocation strategy, which is pay a dividend. The dividend has a certain set of criteria we use between a certain percentage range of our EPS. It gets to a certain yield, and it\u2019s almost $1 billion a quarter now. We do buybacks generally out of free cash flow. We have historically not borrowed to do buybacks. And clearly, our first priority is to invest in the core business and to do acquisitions that make sense. And as you can see, we have been doing both. In terms of the volume of buybacks, remember that we did contribute $850 million to the escrow account, which is also equivalent to a buyback. So, if you count that in, we are probably around $9 billion or so in buybacks, if I remember right, so far this year. Clearly, we have more capacity if you want to do buybacks. We have always said that if we felt there was a disruption in the market and stock was trading at levels that did not reflect intrinsic value, we would be willing to step up our buybacks and borrow money if that made sense. So obviously, we will keep you posted if any of our plans change. Ryan, you may want to add some things.\nRyan McInerney: Nothing to add to your very well-said comments, Vasant.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: I appreciate you taking the question and Vasant, best of luck to you. It\u2019s been a pleasure. Ryan, I wanted to ask about the \u2013 some of the commercial efforts that Visa is making. I know it\u2019s a pretty important driver of sort of new flows, the non-consumer part of your business growth. And this quarter, it was a little bit slower than overall volume. Can you just comment on the pipeline and what you see as the opportunities in commercial and how we should think about that business growing over the next few years?\nRyan McInerney: Sure. Thanks for the question. We remain very excited about B2B in general. It\u2019s an enormous TAM, and we are just kind of scratching the surface, and we are very excited about commercial specifically. We have the largest commercial business on the planet, as we have talked about in the past. I think it\u2019s in the neighborhood of $1.5 trillion of payment volume, and we have been releasing numbers of innovations into the market in that space. we have released Visa Spend Clarity, which helps our clients with expense management, Visa Commercial Pay, which helps with control. There is a lot of things we have done around enabling acceptance around the world. So, we feel good about it. As it relates to the volume, some of the dynamics that we are seeing in the commercial space are similar to what we are seeing in the consumer space, you have the impact from fuel and those types of things. But as we think over the next 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, we have never been more excited about the opportunities that we have got. And we have never felt better about the product that we are putting in the market, and we are getting great feedback from our clients as well.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations to you Vasant. I wanted to ask for a follow-up on Reg II. You mentioned not seeing any impact yet. I am just wondering from your vantage point, whether you are now seeing that routing choice more broadly available to kind of all merchants or are we still in the midst of an implementation and rollout. And then just quickly and separately, your tax rate guidance would imply no impact from the recent Brazil tax law changes that did impact Mastercard, but I am just double checking if that\u2019s the case.\nRyan McInerney: Why don\u2019t I \u2013 I will take the first part and let Vasant take the second part. It\u2019s early days with Reg II. There has been a lot of work that happened ahead of the July 1 date, but there is also work still happening. As it relates to our views on our ability to compete in the space, we are \u2013 we continue to be very excited and confident about our ability to compete. We think that many merchants are going to still choose to route to Visa. As you all know, merchants bear liability for fraud in the e-commerce space. So, when they are making decisions, it\u2019s not just a cost-based decision. And we bring a lot to merchants in terms of the way we help them with managed risk. We have advanced fraud tools, advanced risk scoring capabilities. And as you know, we also have the product functionality enabled by dual messaging to enable a lot of use cases that are key in the e-commerce space. So, we are \u2013 we feel very good about our ability to compete. And there is still a lot that\u2019s going to happen over the course of the next many months and quarters, and we will keep you posted on how it evolves.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. On the Brazil topic, you should ask Mastercard what was unique to them, really no change from our standpoint as it relates to Brazil.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question and Vasant, thank you for always being a gentlemen for all the help over the years. I want to dig a little bit, but actually this question is for you, Vasant. On the gap between nominal cross-border volumes ex inter-Europe and international revenue on a nominal basis, you talked about the FX volatility part plenty. I was just hoping you could dig into a little bit about the other factors that drive that gap, meaning quarter mix and any pricing and how we should think about those over the coming quarters?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Thank you. Yes, it is largely volatility-driven because of the very high volatilities we had last year and more normal volatilities we are getting to now. Beyond that, there is some FX impact, obviously. That line is always affected by FX more than any other line in the P&L. And other than that, there are always mix factors. It depends on corridors and all that. There is always some impact from that. But I would say the bulk of it is the two we have talked about, volatility and exchange rates.\nTimothy Chiodo: Vasant, thank you.\nJennifer Como: Last question Jordan.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey. Thanks so much. Last question, so I won\u2019t ask you, for Vasant. That\u2019s my gift and way to thank you, so I will spare you a macro question. I will ask Ryan instead on Pismo if that\u2019s okay. Ryan, you mentioned \u2013 I think you mentioned shipping products faster in your upfront remarks that made me think about Pismo a little bit. Is buying Pismo an indication in any way that Visa is more interested in owning tech and infrastructure that touches products, the consumer and that gives you a chance to develop products faster? Just I am curious to get your thoughts on that. It feels like you are widening the swim lane a little bit here. Is that fair to say? I would love your thoughts. Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Hi Tien-tsin. What we are trying to do is serve our clients. I mean that\u2019s where it all starts with. And what our clients are looking for is they are looking for innovative processing solutions. They are increasingly looking for cloud-native API-based services. Processing is certainly one of those. We have heard from clients around the world that many of them are embarking on digital transformations in their processing platforms. And so when we hear that from our clients, we immediately get to work on how we can help them, how we can serve them. We went through a global process looking at all the different players around the world, and we identified Pismo as the best. We literally studied hundreds of companies. We met with dozens of them. And after a deep, thorough scan, we identified Pismo. And yes, Pismo is the kind of tech platform, Tien-tsin that you were alluding to. That is the type of tech that our clients are increasingly looking for. And in this example, it was an opportunity for us to buy the leading player that could help clients serve their customers, expand globally and deliver a lot of new leading edge use cases to their customers. So, we are very excited about it. Thanks for the question.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we would like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day, and please join me in wishing Vasant the best.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2023 was very strong with net revenues up 11% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.09, up 17%. Overall, our global quarterly payments volume was up 13% year-over-year, excluding Russia and China. In the U.S., quarterly payments volume was up 10%. Outside the U.S., excluding China and Russia, payments volume was up 17.5%. Excluding intra-Europe, total cross-border volume remained strong, up 32%, with cross-border travel volume at 130% of 2019. Process transactions grew 12% year-over-year. We remain confident that our strategy is focused on the right opportunities. In the second quarter, this strategy continued to deliver, driving strong growth through consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. I'll talk briefly about our progress in each area. Let's start with consumer payments. Consumer payments remains a massive opportunity for Visa. Even with all the digitization over the last several decades, there is still a tremendous amount of cash and check spent globally. There is a very long runway for growth in this business. In consumer payments, the flywheel has three parts: grow credentials, more buyers on the network; grow acceptance, more sellers on the network; and drive engagement, more transactions. We continue to grow credentials, up 7% year-over-year through December and 11% excluding Russia. And we now have more than 6 billion tokenized credentials, up nearly 90% from last year, excluding Russia. We continue to grow acceptance with over 100 million merchant locations worldwide. And tap-to-pay continues to be a powerful driver of engagement. Globally, 74% of all face-to-face transactions outside the U.S. are now taps. In the U.S., we're at 34%, up 7x from three years ago and up more than 10 percentage points from last year. A couple of highlights in the second quarter include U.S. quick service restaurants, where penetration surpassed 40% and in key metro areas across the United States, we continue to see great traction beyond the success in New York and San Francisco, L.A., Detroit, Seattle, San Diego and Ocean to Miami are all now over 40%. Mass transit continues to be one of the best ways to get people used to tapping and we've set records. In the first half of 2023, we processed more than 745 million Visa Tap to Ride transactions globally, up 35% over the first half of last year. We've enabled 55 new transit systems, bringing our footprint to over 650. We also had some significant client wins in the quarter. Starting in North America, we are pleased to have renewed a multiyear agreement with TD, a top 10 North American bank for continued Visa credit and debit issuance in both Canada and the U.S. In Canada, we renewed our relationship with CIBC with a new multiyear agreement for Visa credit issuance. We renewed our partnership with Marqeta, a leading fintech issuer processor and MoneyGram, who is utilizing Visa Direct for cross-border money movement and just recently signed a consumer debit agreement. In Asia-Pacific, UOB one of the leading banks in Asia, has renewed and expanded its relationship with us in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam for both credit and debit cards. OCBC Bank, the second-largest bank in Singapore by market cap, renewed its flagship product and portfolio with us, the OCBC 365 credit card. MUFG bank, the banking arm of Japan's largest financial group, renewed its long-term debit partnership. Chunghwa Post, Taiwan's Post Office and the largest debit issuer in Taiwan has renewed its long-term exclusive partnership with Visa. And in India, we're very excited about a long-term consumer credit contract with Axis Bank, targeting new affluent customer segments. Additionally, I want to highlight an exciting new product innovation that we launched in Japan with our long time partner SMBC. It is a single flexible prudential that a consumer can choose to use as a debit, credit, or prepaid card. SMBC calls the product Olive, and we think it could meaningfully enhance the buying experience for SMBC customers and users in many other countries around the world. Now to Europe, in Germany we've signed a co-brand deal with Solaris and ADAC, which is Germany's largest automobile association with 21 million members. Visa is excited to be the new network of choice for one of the country's largest co-brand portfolios. In Israel, we renewed and expanded our relationship with our largest issuer, Bank Leumi. In Belgium, we recently reached agreements with six issuers to migrate over 2.6 million debit cards to Visa in the next few years, bringing our country total since 2021 to 6.5 million new Visa debit cards. And finally in Latin America, from December 2019 to 2022, we have grown our credentials by 1.5x and our merchant locations by almost 2.5x. Over that time period, the percentage of our total volume that is point-of-sale payments versus getting cash out of an ATM has grown from 46% to 59%, demonstrating the cash digitization happening in the region. In Colombia, we're pleased to partner on a co-brand with LATAM Airlines, the largest airline in Latin America. We continued to strengthen our position in Brazil, renewing our partnership with Itau, the largest private bank in the country. We also announced a new strategic deal with Banco de Brasilia, that expands upon our existing agreement including a popular credit program issued in partnership with one of Brazil's leading football teams with over 40 million fans. Also in Brazil, WhatsApp had already launched peer-to-peer service to facilitate money transfer using Visa Direct, and recently they announced they will be offering payments from consumers to small businesses as well. And more and more, we see clients work with Visa on multiple levels, across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Natura, the world's fourth largest beauty group with 4., -- I'm sorry, 4 million beauty consultants in Latin America is a recent example. In 2020, we announced a deal with them and we just renewed our agreement, which includes digital issuance of a Visa business credential and adds acceptance innovations, as well as CyberSource risk management solutions. Thus far, in Brazil, we've issued cards to almost 50% of the Natura consultants. And we love working with clients that take advantage of our full range of solutions. It's Visa at our best, serving clients in multiple ways across our growth levers. Now let me turn to new flows. The potential payments volume opportunity in new flows is enormous, 10x that of consumer payments. New flows revenue in our second quarter grew more than 20% in constant dollars, excluding Russia. Commercial volume was up 15% in constant dollars and Visa Direct transactions were up 32%, excluding Russia. We've been winning in new flows by executing our network of network strategy. And two weeks ago, we announced a new network called Visa+, that further extends our network of networks. This new network allows users to send and receive payments among different P2P apps through a personalized payment address, a Visa+ Payname. This enables P2P payments from one app directly to another app, as well as gig, creator and marketplace payouts. This can be done through an app, a neo-bank, or a wallet. We're connecting endpoints and form factors and enabling interoperability, our network of network strategy at work. We are launching pilots with several partners including Venmo, PayPal, Tap-to-Pay and Western Union with more to come soon. Let me now turn to Visa Direct. Visa Direct is also a great example of our network of networks. Visa Direct utilizes 66 ACH networks, 11 RTP networks, 16 card-based networks, and five gateways, with the potential to reach nearly 7 billion endpoints globally. We continue to grow Visa Direct with new use cases and partners. For example, in Peru, Banco de Credito del Peru, BBVA, Interbank, and Scotiabank chose Visa Direct as their preferred network and YellowPepper as their technology enabler for the interoperability among their wallets and payment apps. Last year, we announced our agreement with the payments infrastructure platform, Thunes, to add send-a-wallet capabilities to Visa Direct. Similarly, this quarter our cross-border reach continued to grow, expanding coverage to 32 new wallet providers across 22 countries by connecting to TerraPay, a leading cross-border payments infrastructure company. Together, Visa Direct and TerraPay can enable P2P remittances for individuals, as well as business payouts through accounts, wallets, and cards. Enablers remain an important part of our strategy and we're partnering with Pfizer to expand on their U.S. domestic Visa Direct business by commercially launching cross-border capabilities for their clients, starting with outbound payouts. I'll mention two other recent cross-border agreements. We signed a deal with Brightwell, a global payments technology company to leverage Visa Direct to expand cross-border remittances and payout capabilities for their customers in over 175 countries across a variety of industries, such as travel and financial services. And earlier this quarter, PayPal Xoom announced that customers in the United States can send money directly to an eligible Visa debit card in 25 countries, utilizing Visa Direct. In the second quarter, Visa Direct cross-border P2P transactions, excluding Russia, grew nearly 50%. While Visa Direct is growing fast, B2B is the largest component of new flows. And traditional issuance is the core of what we do today in B2B, comprising the majority of the over $760 billion in commercial payments volume year-to-date. I'll highlight three important issuance deals. In Colombia, we renewed with Grupo Bancolombia, the largest issuer acquirer in the country for commercial credit and prepaid, as well as consumer credit. Financial Technology platform, Adyen, has expanded its offerings with a Visa commercial card, initially targeted towards global merchant customers. Visa and Stripe's issuing partnership offers card issuance to enterprise and startup consumers in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe. And for cross-border B2B money movement, which you all know is about Visa B2B Connect, a solution that seeks to deliver predictability, speed, reliability, efficiency, data, and flexibility to our clients. We're building an entirely new network and we're making progress. Over the last six months, we've signed nearly 30 banks in more than 20 countries and payments have been routed to 90 countries globally. And there are several areas for additional expansion in B2B, such as new capabilities, new geographies, and new verticals. Today, I'll talk about two verticals, fleet and fuel and agriculture. In fleet and fuel, we're seeing a big shift in this vertical, where the historically closed-loop systems are opening up and receiving the benefits of our investment and innovation. For example, the Standard Bank in South Africa will issue Visa Fleet Cards in South Africa with plans to roll out across four additional priority markets across Africa in 2024. Over the past two years, Visa has signed or launched fleet-focused solutions for over a dozen providers with more to come. In Latin America, we're bringing our innovative capabilities to an untapped vertical, the agriculture industry. Agriculture represents nearly 15% of the workforce and nearly 25% of the exports in the region, which supplies nearly 15% of the world's food production. Visa has developed a solution called Visa Agro. It provides credit access to farmers in advance of their harvest so that they can buy inputs using Visa credentials, with payment periods aligned with their production cycle. Visa Agro is live in six countries through partnerships with banks, fintechs, processors, and marketplaces. Now, I will touch on value-added services. Value-added services are equally important to Visa's accelerated growth. By offering compelling value-added services, we hope to grow our clients' businesses and deepen our relationships with these clients, increase the yields on our own network volumes, and expand beyond our own network by adding value to non-Visa transactions. Our existing suite of value-added services is impressive. In the second quarter, we had about $1.7 billion in value-added services revenue, up 20% in constant dollars. And our clients continue to add value through value-added services. An example is Wells Fargo. As they modernize their acquiring solutions, they're working with CyberSource to offer enhanced product features and functionality for their merchant services customers. Or in Europe, fiscal year-to-date, we've signed on nearly 80% more clients than last year across 11 countries in our popular risk products, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, which together deliver increased transactions through higher authorization rates, while also lowering fraud. Our network products, which include services such as account and address verification, stop payments, and smarter stand-in processing continued to grow at a rapid pace, with nearly 500 clients added year to date globally. We also enhanced and developed new value-added services, which are helping to drive growth and innovation. I'll briefly share three examples, Visa Acceptance cloud, managed services, and risk as a service. We spoke about Visa Acceptance cloud last year, which moves embedded payment processing from individual devices to the cloud. It eliminates the need for expensive terminals, as well as the cost and time to certify the processing software. I'm pleased to share that First National Bank in South Africa has launched a solution and Visa expects more pilots to follow soon globally. Next is Managed Services, part of our advisory solutions, which is when we embed Visa employees with subject matter expertise within a clients' organization to execute on a specific actionable project, such as an ongoing management of risk and fraud parameters, product implementations, or execution of customer engagement strategies. For example, one issuer for whom we provided end-to-end campaign execution enjoyed a 15% lift in spend and a 40% increase in activation. Managed Services are bringing strong results for our clients and growing revenue twice as fast as our core advisory business through the second quarter. Finally, our Risk as a Service offerings also continued to be utilized, powered by network level data, AI capabilities, and our risk experts. For example, our AI and machine learning-enabled monitoring service identifies suspicious decline activity. For one client, we were able to identify a scheme where fraudsters were testing for valid accounts and then using the accounts to make fraudulent purchases. Visa blocked over $7 million in attempted fraud in just one month on behalf of this client. This is just one example, but you can see how these risk services enable us to both help our clients and generate revenue for Visa. Since launching six months ago, we've added nearly a dozen direct clients across three regions with a very active pipeline. In closing, as you all know, I've been at Visa for nearly a decade, and I can say, I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us. We have a compelling strategy, a world-class team, fantastic clients, and an incredible set of capabilities that I believe are second to none. While the current environment still feels uncertain, we have contingency plans ready and are prepared to take action as needed. We're constantly seeking the right balance between the realities of short term with the enormous opportunities ahead. So with that, now Vasant will lead us through the financial highlights from the quarter and our thoughts on the rest of the year.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. In our fiscal second quarter net revenues were up 11% and GAAP EPS up 20%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 17%. In constant dollars, net revenues grew 13% and non-GAAP EPS grew 20%. Adjusted for the discontinuation of operations in Russia, net revenue growth was around 18% in constant dollars. Net revenue growth exceeded our expectations due to strong value-added services and new flows growth, high currency volatility, and lower-than-anticipated client incentives. A few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 10%. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 13%. As a reminder, January and the early part of February lapped Omicron impacts last year. Index to 2019, excluding China and Russia, global payments volume was up 61%, which is a compound annual growth rate of approximately 12.5% over the pandemic year. U.S. payments volume was up 10% year-over-year, again helped by lapping the Omicron impact last year. Relative to 2019, U.S. payments volume was up 58%, compounding at 12% over the pandemic year. The cross-border travel recovery continues at the pace we expected, indexing at 130 versus four years ago, a 5 point improvement from Q1. As expected, the rebound in Asia is now the primary driver. Travel in and out of Asia reached 2019 levels in the quarter and travel into the U.S. was very close. We believe there is more recovery to come. Travel from Mainland China has mostly benefited other parts of Asia so far, but early bookings suggest strong interest in Europe as the summer approaches. Our new flows and value-added services businesses continued to power ahead. Excluding Russia and in constant dollars, both businesses grew revenues at or about 20%. In the second quarter of fiscal year '23, we bought back approximately $2.2 billion in stock at an average cost of $222.09 and distributed $941 million in dividends. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 10.5% year-over-year, slightly faster than first quarter. U.S. debit grew 9.6%, up more than 1 point from Q1. U.S. card present spend grew 8%. U.S. card not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9%. As you look at the monthly cadence in the U.S. through the quarter, January and the early part of February benefited from lapping Omicron to varying degrees. In March, payments volume growth ticked down and has remained at similar growth level through the first three weeks of April. The primary driver of the tick down in the growth rate has been U.S. ticket size, while transaction growth remains in line with Q1 levels at around 8%. Ticket size is up over 1% year-over-year in the first quarter and it's down about 2% in March through April 21. Ticket sizes are declining as inflation moderates. Most notably, starting in March and through the summer, we will be lapping the peaks in fuel prices last year. For example, in March 2023, fuel prices were nearly 20% lower than last year. In 2022, fuel prices continued to rise through spring and peaked in June. Also contributing discounting in particular retail goods channels, you've heard various U.S. retailers comment publicly about price cuts they are implementing to clear out inventory or pass on reductions in costs. Across other categories of spend in the U.S., payments volume growth remains strong in services, in particular travel and entertainment. Non-discretionary spend growth in categories like food and drug is also holding up well. Another factor that is the potential drag on U.S. payments volume growth starting in March and through April is the impact of lapping higher tax refunds. Refunds are largely spent in the few weeks post receipt. Based on IRS-reported data through April 14, tax refunds are 11% lower this year. We expect this headwind to a bit as we get into May. Moving on to international markets. In constant dollars, international payments volume growth rate was strong through the quarter in the major markets. Latin America was up 27% due to improved growth in Mexico and the South Cone. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 29%. Europe was up 13%. Excluding the U.K., Europe volume grew 31%, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Excluding portfolio conversion, volume trends in the U.K. improved. Asia-Pacific, excluding China, continued to recover, up 17%. Global processed transactions were up 12%. Constant dollar cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe, but including Russia in prior period, were up 32% year-over-year and up 46% versus four years ago. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by about 3 points and the index to four years ago was higher by 5 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 6% year-over-year and was 77% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases and Russia, cross-border e-commerce spending grew in the low-double-digits. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel and intra-Europe, represented over 40% of total cross-border volume in the second quarter. Cross-border travel-related spend excluding intra-Europe grew 59% year-over-year. The cross-border travel, excluding the intra-Europe index to four years ago, went from 129 in December to 134 in March or up 5 points. Travel into Asia now exceeds 2019 level, while travel out of Asia is around 2019 levels, improving 13 and 11 points respectively from the first quarter versus four years ago. Travel out of Mainland China is a key driver to watch. With airline capacity coming back fast and streamline's Visa issuance, Southeast Asia has been the biggest beneficiary of travel from Mainland China. This is beginning to change as airline capacity is added in other corridors, especially Europe and COVID-related requirements are eased. We expect the recovery of Asian, and in particular Chinese travel, to be a key driver of the final leg of the cross-border recovery. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continued to be strong in the low 150s indexed to 2019. Travel inbound to the U.S. is still hovering just under 2019 levels. A strong U.S. dollar, travel Visa backlog and COVID restrictions have been dragged on the recovery, but all are beginning to ease. Europe, excluding intra-Europe, inbound and outbound remained strong with the travel indexed to 2019 in the low 130s for outbound and high 140s for inbound. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean also remained very strong, indexing the 160s to 2019 levels. Travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the high 140s versus four years ago with outbound up more than 5 points from the first quarter and inbound up by about 10 points. Moving now to a quick review of our second quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 7% versus the 7% growth in first quarter, constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was offset by growth from business mix and pricing. Data processing revenues grew 10% versus the 12% process transactions growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia, however, our transactions growth is not. Adjusting for Russia, data processing revenues were up 14%, helped by value-added services strength. International transaction revenues were up 24% versus the 32% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility, although lower than the first quarter and pricing actions, offset by exchange rate shifts and business mix. Other revenues grew 16%, led by marketing and consulting services, as well as benefiting from acquisitions. Client incentives were 26.7% of gross revenues, below expectations due to some deal timing, client performance, and other items. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was led by the strength in domestic volume transactions and cross-border volume, as well as high currency volatility. New flows revenue grew over 20%, excluding Russia in constant dollars. Commercial volumes were up 15% in constant dollars and 60% over four years ago, excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 32%. Value-added services revenue grew 20% in constant dollars, driven by higher-volume increased client penetration and select pricing actions. GAAP operating expenses grew 11%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 13%, led primarily by personnel expenses from headcount additions over the past year. Excluding losses from our equity investments of around $90 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $32 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates and a few other items. Our GAAP tax rate was 19.3% and non-GAAP was 19.4%. GAAP EPS was $2.03, non-GAAP EPS was $2.09, up 17% over last year, inclusive of a 3-point drag from the stronger dollar. Through the first three weeks of April, U.S. payments volume was up 6%, with debit up 6% and credit also up 6%, compared to four years ago, they are up 54%, 63%, and 45% respectively. In key markets around the world, we saw continued strength. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year and are 50% above four years ago. Constant dollar cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe grew 28% and was 47% of our four years ago. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 77% about four years ago. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 31% over four years ago. Moving now to our outlook for the third quarter. Growth in domestic payments volumes remained stable around the globe. As we said last quarter, the recovery from COVID is behind us now for domestic volume. Post the Omicron impact from last year in January and February, U.S. domestic volume growth rates have ticked down in March, driven by the factors we discussed earlier. We believe that some of these factors will persist through the third quarter. As such, we are assuming March and April trends will continue in the U.S. for the rest of the quarter. In aggregate, we expect the international growth trajectory remains largely unchanged from the second quarter. On the cross-border front, the travel recovery trend has been steady and generally in line with our expectations so far in fiscal year '23. The cross-border travel index to 2019, excluding intra-Europe, has been improving at a rate of 5 points to 6 points each quarter. We are assuming this trend is sustained through the third quarter. The big driver as recovery in Asia continuing, especially driven by Mainland China. We expect Chinese travel to extend beyond Asia to Europe as we enter the summer. On the cross-border e-commerce front, we're also assuming recent trends continue, adjusted for crypto-related volatility. It is important to note that even as the cross-border business continues to recover, relative to 2019, the year-over-year growth rate will continue to slow down as it has over the past few quarters. Also, currency volatility is moderating, and we are now lapping very high currency volatility from the third quarter of last year. Our value-added services and new flows businesses have grown much faster than our consumer payments business. Sustaining faster growth rates for these businesses remains a critical priority. Client incentive growth is expected to be higher in the second half than it was in the first. This was driven by some delays in renewals that were expected in the first half, as well as some significant renewals that were anticipated in fiscal year '24 but are now happening in the second half of fiscal year '23. In the first half, client incentives as a percent of gross revenue was below our outlook range of 26.5% to 27.5%. In the second half, this percentage is likely to run above the high-end of the range. We expect to finish the year in the upper half of the 26.5% to 27.5% range. When you put all this together, third quarter net revenue growth is expected to be in the low-double-digits, inclusive of an approximately 1 point drag from exchange rate. As we indicated previously, non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to moderate through the year. Our expectations remain unchanged. Q3 non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to be 2 points to 3 points lower than the second quarter inclusive of an exchange rate impact, which may add half a point to growth. And Q4 non-GAAP operating expense growth will likely be another 2 points, 3 points lower than Q3. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items and the litigation provision from the third quarter last year. Non-operating income will continue to benefit from the attractive rates we're earning on our cash balances. As you know, short-term rates have been high lately, which is very helpful given that we always have very low duration on our cash balances. Interest income from cash will likely offset interest expense from debt by $5 million to $10 million in the third quarter. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in the third quarter. As we've said previously, should there be a recession on a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our presumptions, they will of course adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs, and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel, and other controllable categories. In summary, as Ryan said, Visa today has three robust growth engines, consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Our results in the second quarter attest that growth remains healthy across all three businesses. The opportunity is vast and the runway for growth remains long. With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I want to talk a little bit about Visa+, a little bit on the mechanics and sort of what could be, and then a brief follow-up. So on mechanics, my understanding is, as you mentioned, apps, neo banks, and wallets can be a part of this, but what about the prospect of any account being able to be attached to a Payname that's associated with Visa+, meaning traditional bank accounts. And also understand that at present, the Payname concept in Visa+ is domestic only, but potentially has the -- I guess the chance to expand to cross-border.\nRyan McInerney: Thanks for the question. Just before I get into two specific parts that you asked about, just back up, Visa+ is a great example of how a lot of innovations in Visa work. Our team started with a problem in the market, which is people have, we all have these apps with money in them, and it's not easy to get money from one app to another and so starting with the problem, which then created the opportunity, we then together with a number of different parts of the company laid out a roadmap and then announced the Payname feature in the Visa+ network, I guess it was a couple of weeks ago. And like anything to find product market fit, we are starting with kind of some very specific use cases, so, yes, domestic. Yes, we've started with a few partners who happen to be, but not just in the P2P wallet business like PayPal is, with both Venmo and PayPal, we also mentioned Western Union, who is a launch partner with us. In theory, the Payname construct could be extended to really any source of funds on any surface, but we're really focused on, it's early days. We just launched, we think it's a great idea. We think it's got great product market fit. We've gotten really good feedback from the market. We're focused on launching in the U.S. with the partners that we mentioned, then we'll go from there. Thanks for the question, Timothy.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordin.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJennifer Como: Tien-Tsin, are you there?\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, Jennifer, can you hear me?\nJennifer Como: Yes, now we can.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question and for all the good detail here. Just -- I want to make sure just can we infer from the no change in the operating expense outlook here that Vasant went through, that the modest slowdown you saw in March is limited to the U.S. and largely inflation, and I think tax related. It sounds like it shouldn't extend beyond third quarter from what you see, and otherwise no real surprises in the consumer globally, just wanted to rehash that back to you.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, the short answer is yes. We think the consumer is still in good shape. As we said, spending across most categories other than a couple I mentioned like fuel and some retail goods price cutting, very strong across services, strong across travel and entertainment, strong in non-discretionary, so, yes, that's how we feel.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nWill Nance: Hi, guys. I appreciate you taking my question. We've heard a couple of instances of several large merchants that have made the decision to start routing more e-commerce -- more e-commerce transactions over alternative networks over the past three to five months, so I just wanted to maybe get an update on your thoughts around some of the recent regulations in the U.S. based on conversations with acquirers, merchants, and issuers, are there any updated thoughts or expectations around the potential impact of new regulations that are implemented over the next few several months?\nRyan McInerney: No updates, but I'll just kind of again summarize for you how we see things. The changes that the Fed put in place were consistent with our expectations. No changes to the card-present side of things. Obviously, in the e-commerce side of things, it requires issuers to enable to one affiliated networks for e-comm. Most Visa issuers were already in compliance. Those that aren't will be. We've said and continue to believe that there'll be minimum impact in fiscal year '23 and beyond that, it's yet to be determined. We'll kind of see how the marketplace plays out. We continue to believe that merchants are going to want to choose to route transactions to Visa for a number of reasons. One is, in the e-comm space the merchants bear the liability for fraud in e-commerce. So the ability to save a couple of basis points in cost have to be weighed against the risk that comes from the liability of fraud in the e-commerce space. We believe that our tools, capabilities, and platforms to help reduce fraud are second to none. We've got advanced fraud and risk processing capabilities that help both issuers, acquirers, and sellers reduce fraud. And we've also got a product that has dual messaging functionality that, in a number of different use cases whether it's airlines or hotels or rental cars or the retail space, where they are ordering multiple products that are shipped at different times. The enhanced dual messaging functionality is really required. So, as always, we're going to -- we're going to continue to compete vigorously. We're going to continue to invest in our products, our capabilities, our services. The market is very competitive today. It's going to get more competitive, but we like our chances to continue to win.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTrevor Williams: Great. Thanks. I want to follow-up on value-added services and how much cyclicality we should expect on that line. I mean, they've been consistently growing faster than net revenue. Vasant, I know you said maintaining that elevated growth in new flows and value-added services is a priority, but if we are in an environment with slowing volume growth, just -- how do you expect value-added services in aggregate? And I know there's a wide range of what gets folded in under that label, but just in aggregate, how you expect value-add services to hold up relative to the consumer payments business? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I'll start and I'm sure Ryan will add. Yes, our goal of course is to grow the value-added services business faster than the consumer payments business and you have to remember that the secular growth in that business coming from adding new services, which we are doing regularly from expanding services outside the U.S., which we're doing, as well as deepening penetration with existing clients because all of them by all of the services. So there's already a secular growth component. In terms of being affected by market trends, there are services clearly that are linked to transactions. That's true of many of our services, like our DPS business, which is issuer processing on a CyberSource business and even to some degree the fraud businesses. So, yes, these transactions are impacted in some way. There will be some impact on it, but that is underlying secular growth in that business. I don't know if you'd add anything?\nRyan McInerney: Nothing to add, well said.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.\nBob Napoli: Thank you and good afternoon. I wanted to -- without the growth in new flows and networks, I just wanted to follow-up on the evolution of new technologies, AI and blockchain, and how that's affecting your business? How Visa is utilizing those technologies? And do they add any opportunities or risks to your business?\nRyan McInerney: Hi Bob. I think I heard gist of the question cut in and out a little bit. Let me hit AI and blockchain. I think that's what you're asking. I think more broadly. We're obviously monitoring anything and everything that's impacting commerce and money movement around the world. And our approach is what it has been, which is to lean into those technologies and use them to add value to our products and services and clients and capabilities around the world. I guess, AI and blockchain. On AI, clearly, a lot of activity in generative AI right now. Before I get to that, I'll just mention that we have a long history of developing and using predictive AI and deep learning. We were one of the pioneers of applied predictive AI. We have an enormous data set that we've architected to be utilized at scale by hundreds of AI and ML different services that people use all across Visa. We use it -- we need to run our company more effectively. We use it to serve our clients more effectively. And this will continue to be a big part of what we do. As you transition to generative AI, this is where we see this as an opportunity to take our current AI services to the next level. We are kind of as a platform, experimenting with a lot of the new capabilities that are available. We've got people all over the company that are tinkering and dreaming and thinking and doing testing and figuring out ways that we could use generative AI to transform how we do what we do, which is deliver simple, safe and easy-to-use payment solutions. And we're also spending a fair time thinking how generative AI will change the way that sellers sell, and we all buy and all of the shop. So that is -- it's a big area of opportunity that we're looking at in many different ways across the company. In terms of, I guess, blockchain and crypto, it's -- as far as we see, it's still early days, still emerging technologies. But as we've said in other venues, we see the potential for blockchain. We see the potential for stable coins. If you look at what we're doing in the market today, it's relatively basic, but I'd call it important work. We're enabling on and off ramps on crypto. We're working with exchanges around the world to issue their users Visa credentials, and we're developing the capability for our issuer and acquirer partners to have a choice to settle in stable coins. And we're engaging with central banks all around the world on CBDC priorities. Now the stuff we've got going in the lab, if you will, the R&D work that we're doing is we're testing and ideating on all sorts of different ideas on how we could leverage blockchain and Web3 and Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions, smart contracts. I mean we've got teams of people that are exploring all those different types of innovations. And we'll see how they play out in the market. And if there's things to scale, we want to be part of that.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Vasant, I'm just trying to think about all the areas that are impacting you differently than what you may have planned for, for the fiscal year like this transitory impact that you mentioned in March and April that are persisting and then the moderating FX volatility. As we pull up and think about the fiscal year, do you feel like we're in about the same place where you started in terms of your forecast given the strength in other places? Just trying to think through all of that. Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I think that's right. Clearly, the moderation in volatility is not a big surprise. Volatility last year were very high by historical standards. If anything, they've held up better than we expected so far this year. And even now, they're, I'd say, a little bit higher than long run medians, but not -- last year was real highs that we haven't seen in a while. So that's not a surprise. The cross-border business is recovering almost on track with our expectations, which, again, we had no real crystal ball, but we are very close to what we were expecting. And it's recovering nicely, and it's exactly as we expected. Asia driving it. China playing an important role. The cross-border e-commerce business, in general, the e-commerce business is holding up well. International is very strong, especially Europe. Europe is strong. Define what we may have expected going into the year. If there is a positive surprise, it's clearly Europe. And then other parts of the world like Latin America, many most parts of Latin America and the Middle East are also doing well. And Asia is recovering. So yes, I mean, as you would expect something is better than you expect, something is a little bit lower. But in aggregate, the business is doing as well or better than we expected, as you saw from our results.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Good afternoon, guys. Just going back to your initial expectations for fiscal '23 at the outset of the fiscal year. I believe you were forecasting that Q4 net revenue growth would accelerate versus Q3. Just wondering if that's still the case given some of the quarterly moving parts here, including on the incentive line. Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: I don't think we gave you a quarterly revenue growth outlook. So I don't know exactly where that came from. I mean, we said -- we gave you some sense of our planning assumptions for the full year, and said that we would give you one quarter out. Our best sense of the quarter out, which we've done for Q3. And we'll give you our best sense of Q4 when we get to July.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just had question on the upcoming official launch of Fed -- now in July, Ryan, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, of course, that Visa Direct works with dozens of other networks around the world. Are you anticipating connecting into FedNow? And can you just update us again on how you see the rollout of FedNow affecting Visa, particularly your ability to win in new flows? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Thanks, Lisa. Yes, we want to connect to any real-time payment network in the planet - on the planet, and that's been our track record so far. That's the short answer to the first part of your question. Just back up, and I'll just take a minute on this. Before I dive into FedNow, let me put it in context as it relates to Visa. Today, I'll start with Visa Debit. Visa Debit is a feature-rich widely adopted safe, simple, secure payment option. We've got global broad-based acceptance. We've got dual message capabilities, as I mentioned earlier, well-established disputes and charge-back processes, well-understood rules and accepted rules, not just in the U.S. but around the world. We've got zero liability fraud protection, tokenization capabilities, risk management tools, security services. And it's a really, really good customer experience. It's a great buying experience. It's a great selling experience. So that's Visa Debit. On Visa Direct, Visa Direct builds on all those features, the scale, the ubiquity, the great experiences to deliver push payment solutions, both domestically and around the world, as I mentioned earlier to 7 billion endpoints. And there, too, it's a really, really good customer experience, both for the user and for the kind of enabler of the experience. So if you put FedNow in context of all of that. So just to talk specifically about FedNow, the first thing I would say is that modernizing the payments infrastructure in the United States is a smart thing to do. It's a necessary thing to do, and it's good for Americans. So that's -- it's something that is a good thing happening in the U.S. And I'd also say that any force that digitizing money movement is a catalyzing force for all of us. And I expect that the FedNow, like TCH, it's going to take some time. It will eventually get traction, but it will take some time to build adoption. And one of the most -- I'd say it this way. One of the most powerful capabilities in payments is ubiquity. RTP doesn't have that yet in the U.S. It will happen, but it's going to take time. And the other thing I'd say is that an RTP transaction is a relatively simple transaction type, it's instant, it's permanent and it's irrevocable. I think over time, it will get enhanced, but that's kind of where we are. So if you take all that and say, what does it mean? I think the most instructive thing to do as we think about real-time payments in the U.S. is look around the world. And if you go to the U.K., we've had faster payments in the U.K. for 15 years now. We haven't seen much, if any, impact on Visa Debit. And the U.K. is also -- it's a robust and growing market for Visa Direct. So just I think we'll see what happens. We'll see how things expand in the U.S., but kind of like I was saying earlier, we like our products. We love our clients. We love the capabilities and teams that we have, and we feel good about our ability to continue to add value and grow the businesses in the U.S.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Your line is open.\nRayna Kumar: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. B2B Connect seems like it could be a big opportunity to capture B2B cross-border. I know, Ryan, you mentioned that over the last six months, Visa has done nearly 30 banks for B2B Connect. Can you talk about the competitive environment and the sales process with those customers? And if you can give us a sense of how much volume has been flowing through B2B Connect. Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yes, thanks for the question. We're building out a new network. We know how to do that, and we also know it takes time. If I give you an example and then come back to your question, we're excited to talk with all of you about the success we're having with Visa Direct. The billions of transactions, the use cases, everything that we're seeing now. That journey started many, many years ago, country by country, client by client, working with our issuing clients, especially to get into their tech cues, build out the functionality and then fast forward many years and we're having the success that we're having with that platform today. B2B Connect is in the earlier stages of that. So to your question around the sales cycles, we know how to do it. We've done it with other networks as we built out, but it takes time. Country-by-country around the world we're working with our banks. We're helping them understand the value of the product and the solution, which almost unanimously is the easiest part of the sales process. Like when you compare B2B Connect versus the alternatives that are out there, I mean, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, side-by-side to almost any other alternative that's out there, B2B Connect is a far superior product but it takes store. So we're working on it country by country. I mentioned some of the numbers in my prepared remarks. I don't have any numbers to share today beyond those. And we expect, over time, we'll share more with you about the success we're hopefully having.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open.\nDavid Koning: Yes. Hi, guys. Thank you. And my question, just personnel expense was up 24% year-over-year. It was one of the biggest increases we've seen, which is kind of in the face of a lot of tech companies that are cutting. Why was it up so much, I guess, is just the question.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. It's additions, we had made over the last 12 months in head count. There's also some unusual items that flow through there that are offset. This is the deferred comp. It hits you on the personnel line, but it's offset on the nonoperating income line. So that distorts it a little bit. But you will see that growth rate start to decline quite a bit because we've been moderating headcount increases as we went through the year. And it's all incorporated in the outlook we gave you for expenses, which we told you with the growth of expenses will flow through the year. It was 2 points or 3 points lower than last quarter. This quarter, it will be 2 points to 3 points lower next quarter and another 2 points to 3 points lower in the fourth quarter, and we're on track for that.\nJennifer Como: Last question, Jordin.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hi, thanks guys. Vasant, we heard your comments on third quarter growth expectations, but would just love to hear a little bit more on full year. You've obviously outperformed so far especially on -- really on both reported and constant currency basis, the first fiscal quarters. And then guidance seems to be shaping up better than your full year outlook. So just maybe a little more comment on how you see the full year versus guidance? And then I guess, Ryan, on the yields, it looks so strong. Is that -- do you see a long runway for value-added services to keep growing as a percentage of the yield of every transaction revenue mix going forward, so that that can keep being sustainable?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Look, I think we'll stick with what we said earlier. I think you have a good sense of the trends. And if the trends continue, you have -- it's very easy for you to assess what the fourth quarter would look like. And as it relates to value-added services, I don't know, Ryan, if you want to add anything. But clearly, I mean, the approach to value-added services is the yield and answer. If you have the transaction, the more value-added services you can provide, the higher the yield you can get on the transaction, and that is clearly the objective.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. I think we've got great sales teams, great product teams all around the world. They're doing a great job sitting with our clients, helping them understand these products and services and getting those products and services embedded into our clients. And we've got a very robust product pipeline across all of our various types of value-added services and we're optimistic about the ability to continue to grow that business.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team.

Visa's performance in the first quarter of 2023 reflects stable domestic volumes and transactions and a continued recovery of cross-border travel. Total Q1 payments volume was up 7% year-over-year or 135% versus three years ago, flat with Q4. Excluding Russia and China, payments volume was up 12% or 146% of 2019. U.S. Q1 payments volume was up 9% year-over-year or 144% of 2019, down 1 point from Q4. International volume, excluding Russia and China, was up 15% or 147% of 2019, up 1 point from Q4. Q1 cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, grew 31% year-over-year and 132% versus three years ago, up 5 points from Q4. Excluding Russia, cross-border year-over-year growth was higher by 4 points. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 6 points from 112% of 2019 in Q4 to 118% in Q1, driven by Asia Pacific, helped by China lifting restrictions, continued modest improvements inbound into the United States and CEMEA benefiting from the FIFA World Cup. Processed transactions were up 10% year-over-year or 139% versus 2019, and we processed 571 million transactions a day during the quarter. Although first quarter net revenues grew -- altogether, I should say, first quarter net revenues grew 12% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21%. In each of our growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, we saw strong revenue growth. In our consumer payments business, we made significant progress this quarter through large deals with traditional issuers and co-brands. And with the pandemic largely behind us, we saw many businesses focused on payments through Visa's new flows capabilities. In addition, we continue to develop and expand our global value-added services globally. Now let me explore each of these growth areas. In consumer payments, credentials grew 8% overall, 11% excluding Russia, with strong double-digit growth in the United States, India and Brazil. Tap-to-pay penetration of face-to-face transactions globally was 72%, excluding Russia and the United States. In the United States, we surpassed a notable 30%, with San Jose, San Francisco and New York City all above 50%. U.S. drugstores went above 40% for the first time in the United States, and nearly 65% of Costco's face-to-face credit transactions were made with a tap. In the United States, we had several important renewals. First, we renewed our partnership with Bank of America in the United States, maintaining our current debit and credit business, including their cash rewards, travel rewards, premium rewards and newly launched Premium Rewards Elite consumer credit cards. We're excited to continue to invest together in the growth of our joint business and to innovate with Bank of America to deliver enhanced capabilities and improved experiences for their customers. Second, we renewed with Commerce Bank, a top 25 Visa U.S. issuer across their consumer and commercial portfolios. Finally, we also renewed our agreement with Capital One. In Australia, we renewed our agreement with the country's largest independent payment solutions provider, Costco, with over 4 million cardholders for debit and prepaid and also signed a new agreement for credit issuance. Also in the region, we extended our exclusive relationship with Kiwibank, the largest New Zealand-owned bank. In Latin America, we renewed with ICBC Argentina, one of the largest issuers in the country, and with Banco do Brasil, one of the largest Visa issuers in the region. In addition, we entered into a new agreement with one of the largest banks in Panama, Banco Nacional de Panam\u00e1. Also in Latin America, we reached a new strategic deal with fintech platform, Tigo Money and parent company, Millicom, a leading provider of telecommunication services in the region. Visa and Millicom expect to offer Tigo Money's more than 5 million wallet users the ability to digitize their cash in an easy and secure way, making purchases wherever Visa is accepted with the Visa-Tigo Money Access Card. Another strategic fintech deal was with Niyo in India, a fast-growing cross-border focused neobank with 5 million customers. We've extended our relationship from debit into credit to grow cross-border spending with affluent as well as corporate customers. We're also happy to share that we renewed and extended our global partnership with HSBC. Our agreement covers consumer and commercial and it will foster growth and digital acceleration. This deal also cuts across all of Visa's five regions. As you know, Visa is the leader in travel co-brand globally, and I'm happy to report that we recently reached agreements with three important travel relationships. First, Qatar Airways' Privilege Club, which today has a split portfolio across networks around the world, has signed a new 10-year exclusive partnership with Visa to enhance and expand its portfolio of co-branded payment initiatives with key financial partners across key markets worldwide. This expanded partnership creates a new world of opportunities for our Visa customers and Privilege Club members to collect and spend Avios, the rewards currency of Privilege Club. Second, with Southwest Airlines in the United States, Visa will continue to be the exclusive payment network for their co-brand credit card issued by JPMorgan Chase. It represents one of the largest co-brand partnerships in the world. Third, with Star Alliance and HSBC in Australia, this is the world's first credit card created with an airline alliance and is issued exclusively on Visa Credit. At the time of the launch, it brought together seven Star Alliance carriers in a single credit card platform. Also, we recently advanced our co-brand partnership with Flipkart, one of India's leading digital commerce entities with a registered customer base of 450 million. So whether it's with traditional issuers or co-brand partners, we are continuing to position Visa well for the future. On to new flows, where this past quarter, new flows continued to grow with revenue up more than 20% in constant dollars led by strong growth in B2B payments volume and Visa Direct transactions. First, on the Visa Direct side, Visa Direct had 1.9 billion transactions in Q1, up 39% year-over-year, excluding Russia. We continue to grow globally. Non-U.S. Visa Direct transactions as a percentage of total transactions expanded nearly 20 points, excluding Russia, from Q1 '21 to Q1 '23. Building on the success of our remittance program with Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong, we recently launched Malaysia as an additional origination market spanning across six currency payers with more currencies to come. We also continue to bring existing use cases to new markets. First, in Australia, Visa Direct is now enabling driver payouts with DoorDash. Second, we launched our inaugural P2P program in South Africa with FNB, one of the country's largest banks to enable their 10 million active customers to move money within their mobile app using Visa Direct rails. Third, we launched our wallet cash payout program in Bangladesh with bKash. With this launch, the nearly 65 million bKash users can make wallet to money, bank transfers, 24/7 in near real time using Visa Direct. We are enabling several use cases, including seller payouts in the United States on Poshmark, a social media marketplace where more than 80 million registered users, and card top-offs with fintech, GoHenry. As a follow-on to the issuance deal we announced last quarter with them, GoHenry is enabling its members to top up their child's prepaid Visa card with Visa Direct first in the UK, with plans to expand this service across Europe in the future. In addition to Visa Direct, we had noteworthy developments in the B2B space this past quarter, where commercial payments volume grew 15% in constant dollars. In traditional issuance, we signed an agreement with Raiffeisen Bank for a new commercial credit partnership in addition to renewing customer -- consumer credit across their 3 million clients in Austria. And in the United States, we renewed with UBS for consumer credit and debit as well as several business credit portfolios and Visa Spend Clarity for business. Another issuing partnership was with Stone, one of the largest acquirers in Brazil focused on small businesses. Stone has recently become a Visa debit and credit issuer of cards that could be embedded digitally in its wallet. On the virtual card front, for accounts receivable and payable, we completed several agreements. First, Divvy, an expense management platform owned by BILL, has renewed its agreement to offer Visa virtual cards for small and midsized businesses in the United States as part of its expense and vendor payment solutions. Second, Viewpost converts U.S.-based B2B check payments to Visa virtual cards. And together, we are expanding card opportunities for issuers and corporates by offering a solution that can be deployed easily to every commercial business that still produces checks. Third, we've reached an agreement with Plate IQ, a leading end-to-end accounts payable automation provider in the United States with direct integrations to accounting systems. Plate IQ will be offering a Visa virtual card solution to commercial partners across multiple industries including restaurants and hospitality, retail and accounting and bookkeeping, among others. Fourth, in our Asia Pacific region, SUNRATE, a global payment and treasury management platform has launched Visa virtual cards as part of its solution for more than 1,000 B2B clients, including global online travel agencies and small business customers. Fleet issuance continues to grow as well. This quarter, we issued -- we signed with Zemo a European fleet and mobility solutions provider to issue Visa Open Loop fleet and fuel commercial cards as they expand from three European markets to 10. In the United States, Highnote, a cloud-native card issuance and embedded finance platform, expanded its relationship with Visa with a five-year card issuance agreement across credit, debit, virtual solutions and fleet. In addition, Highnote became certified as a Visa Fleet card processor, which provides businesses with more specific product category level controls and more detailed and faster data for real-time decisions on new fleet and fuel card programs. B2B is an active space for fintechs and Visa continues to partner with new players to drive innovation for businesses. A recent example is Konfio, a fintech in Mexico that has already issued approximately 50,000 Visa small business cards and recently expanded its agreement to issue Visa Business Infinite cards. In addition, they are positioned to grow acceptance in the market with their newly established acquiring business, Sr. Pago. Now moving to value-added services, which had about $1.7 billion in revenue this first quarter, up more than 20% in constant dollars. Remember that our focus for value-added services is threefold: one, to deepen client penetration of existing products; two, to build and launch new solutions; and three, to expand geographically. CyberSource is a great example on all three areas of focus. First, on deepening client penetration of existing products. CyberSource's Decision Manager offering provides broad capabilities to existing CyberSource clients and has experienced strong growth throughout the pandemic, more than doubling transactions in the last three years. In Q1, transactions utilizing Decision Manager grew in the low teens year-over-year, demonstrating the continued demand for this solution even as we enter a post-pandemic environment. Another area of growth we have mentioned is with acquirers who utilize CyberSource's capabilities to offer them to their merchant clients.  In Q1, we signed agreements with several acquirers for gateway services, including Elavon in North America. In Saudi Arabia, Saudi British Bank has announced its strategic partnership with our CyberSource Payment Gateway and Risk Platform to enhance the overall capabilities of SABB's payment gateway with the aim of fostering the bank's growth in an evolving and dynamic e-commerce space. On extended geographically, we've continued our efforts to strengthen our global presence. Our non-U.S. CyberSource transactions have nearly quadrupled since the first quarter of 2019, and they now comprise the majority of our transactions, led in particular by the Asia Pacific region. CyberSource has also created new offerings. While historically, CyberSource has been an e-commerce capability, over the past few years, we have accelerated the product development of our card-present and omnichannel offerings, including with the acquisition of Payworks back in 2019. In the past quarter, we saw nearly 50% of year-over-year increase in card-present authorized CyberSource transactions. Other value-added services highlights this quarter include our innovative dispute capability through Verifi, which saw nearly 40% growth in cases processed this quarter as we expanded globally with more than 1/3 of our cases from outside North America. This rapid dispute resolution solution automatically resolves disputes between merchants and issuers through the acquirer of rails, reduce the average time to resolve a dispute from 24 days to typically seconds. And Tink, our open banking platform continue to deepen and develop relationships across Europe. Tink recently signed a master agreement with BNP Paribas to be their main open banking and money movement services provider for millions of customers across Europe. Tink is already live with several businesses in the group. 3 million customers use Tink's money management, data enrichment and transactions products at BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium and BNL in Italy. Tink has also renewed and expanded its commitment with ABN AMRO to integrate Tink's Money Manager and data enrichment products into the bank's app for more than 3 million customers. In conclusion, in the first quarter, Visa delivered very strong results and continue to effectively execute our growth strategy. Vasant will go into detail on our thoughts for the rest of the year, but I'd like to make a few other brief closing comments. We will continue to manage our business for the medium to long term, and we'll invest in initiatives that are compelling and will provide future growth, all while being very mindful of the current environment. I continue to see a bright future for Visa as we look ahead to the rest of this year and beyond, and I believe we have the right strategy to continue to deliver great results. As we announced in November, effective February 1, 2023, I'll be stepping down as CEO and assuming the full-time role as Executive Chairman. I'm exceedingly grateful to the Board and leadership of Visa, in addition to all of our passionate 26,500 employee colleagues who helped make this job so rewarding. I'm proud of all that we have accomplished together since I started in 2016. Ryan McInerney will become Visa's CEO, and I cannot think of a finer leader to continue to position Visa at the center of money movement in increasingly innovative ways. I worked side-by-side with Ryan for almost 6.5 years. He knows our business, our clients and he is deeply respected by our employees. He and his team will do a great job, and I expect this transition to be totally seamless.  With that in mind, and as Jennifer alluded to, I've asked Ryan to join the Q&A portion of our call today. But before that, let me hand it over to Vasant to provide financial highlights for the quarter and our thoughts on the second quarter and beyond.\nVasant Prabhu : Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal first quarter results reflect sustained growth in domestic spending and continued recovery in cross-border travel. Net revenues were up 12%, GAAP EPS up 8%, non-GAAP EPS was up 21%. The strong dollar dragged down reported net revenue growth by almost 3 points and non-GAAP EPS growth by approximately 3.5 points. Discontinuation of operations in Russia reduced net revenue growth by about 4.5 points. Adjusted for Russia, net revenues were up almost 20% in constant dollars. Net revenue growth exceeded our expectations as value-added services and new flows growth were very strong, currency volatility stayed high and client incentives were lower than anticipated. A few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year and 35% above 2019. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 46% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume was up 9% year-over-year and 44% over 2019. In constant dollars, international payments volume, excluding China and Russia, was up 15% year-over-year and 47% above 2019. U.S. holiday spending growth was in the high single digits on a year-over-year basis and up more than 41% versus 2019. E-commerce maintained its share of retail spending versus last year, up over 5 points since 2019. Spending continues to smooth out over the holiday season with Black Friday and Cyber Monday still significant shopping days but less important post pandemic. Holiday spending around the globe was generally consistent with U.S. trends. The cross-border travel recovery continues. However, as expected, the pace of recovery has moderated as most borders are now open, including Japan in October and now China in January. As a reminder, we saw a very sharp cross-border travel recovery in October and November of 2021, which we are lapping. Indexed to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, rose 6 points in the first quarter versus a 20-point gain in the third quarter of fiscal year '22 and 10 points in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. New plans -- new flows and value-added services revenue sustained robust growth in excess of 20% in constant dollars. In the first quarter of fiscal year '23, we bought back approximately $3.1 billion in stock at an average price of $198.74. Contributions to the litigation escrow account, which have the same effect as a stock buyback, added another $350 million. We also distributed $945 million in dividends. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 10% year-over-year and 35% over 2019, lapping the credit recovery from last year, and as compared sequentially to last quarter, impacted by retail spending and fuel prices. U.S. debit grew 8%, up sequentially over last quarter. In level to 2019, debit grew 55% withstanding significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. U.S. card present spend grew 8% year-over-year, impacted by fuel prices and retail spend as compared sequentially to last quarter. U.S. card present spend was 26% above 2019. U.S. card not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9% year-over-year and was 65% higher than 2019. E-commerce spend remains well above the pre-COVID trend line even as card-present spending has recovered. On the international front in constant dollars, Latin America was up 25% year-over-year and 107% higher than 2019. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 25% year-over-year and was 108% higher than 2019 as we saw, all through FY '22, growth in both regions was fueled by client wins, cash digitization and acceptance expansion. Europe was up 10% year-over-year and 34% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion that is now nearly complete in the UK. Ex UK, Europe volumes grew 28% year-over-year and was 71% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Ex portfolio conversions, volume trends in the UK remained stable. Asia Pacific, excluding China, continued to recover, up 16% year-over-year and 34% above 2019. Global processed transactions were up 10% year-over-year and 39% over 2019 levels. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe but including Russia in prior periods, were up 31% year-over-year and 32% over 2019. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by about 4 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 3% year-over-year and was 55% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases and Russia, cross-border e-commerce spending grew in the low double digits. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel, represented over 40% of total cross-border volume in the first quarter. Cross-border travel spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 63% year-over-year and is now 18% above 2019. The cross-border travel, excluding Europe, indexed to 2019 went from [114] in September to [121] in December. Travel in and out of Asia recovered sharply in the quarter by more than 12 points from the mid-70s indexed to 2019 to 85 for outbound and more than 90 for inbound helped by Japan. Japan alone improved by about 50 points since opening its borders in October. With China lifting restrictions on January 8, we expect more recovery to come. Europe inbound and outbound remained strong, with the travel indexed to 2019 in the 120s for outbound and 130s for inbound, both up slightly from the fourth quarter. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continues to be strong in the low 140s indexed to 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter. Travel inbound to the U.S. approached 2019 levels and improved 4 points in the quarter, likely due to the weakening dollar. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean remained very strong and stable, indexing around 150 to 2019 levels. Travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the 130s and mid-120s, respectively, relative to 2019, with outbound up more than 10 points in the quarter and inbound by more than 15, helped by the FIFA World Cup. Finally, some color on Mainland China post the removal of COVID zero policies. The 40-day Spring Festival season is underway in Mainland China, the world's largest travel event. Domestic travel is rising sharply. From a revenue standpoint, this will not contribute much. In terms of outbound mainland Chinese travel, this will pick up steam as more flight capacity is available, ticket prices moderate, new passports and visas are obtained and restrictions are lifted in some corridors. The initial destinations for mainland Chinese visitors look to be Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, in particular, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. Inbound travel to Mainland China has not increased much and may not until the COVID situation settles down. Moving now to a quick review of first quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 10% versus the 10% growth in fourth quarter constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was offset by growth from business mix, pricing and card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 6% versus the 10% process transactions growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia. However, our transactions growth is not. Adjusted for Russia, data processing revenues were up 10%. International transaction revenues were up 29% versus the 31% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility, although lower than the fourth quarter and pricing actions, which were offset by exchange rate shifts. Other revenues grew 31%, led by marketing and consulting services, pricing actions and acquisitions. Client incentives were 26% of gross revenues, below expectations due to some adjustments based on client performance and other items. For the year, we expect to renew about 20% of our payments volume with a good amount already completed in the first quarter. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows revenue growth was over 20% in constant dollars. Commercial card volumes grew 15% year-over-year and are up 45% versus 2019. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 39%. Value-added services revenue was also up over 20% in constant dollars, driven by higher volume, increased client penetration and select pricing actions. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. GAAP operating expenses grew 25%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 15%. Non-GAAP operating expense growth was higher than expected, primarily due to a smaller exchange rate benefit. The primary drivers of expense growth were personnel costs from hiring activity in the second half of last year and into the first quarter, as well as G&A expenses driven by lower exchange rate benefits, higher travel and expenses from new acquisitions. Marketing increased 18%, primarily driven by the FIFA World Cup spend and client marketing. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $106 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $7 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates and some other items. Our tax rate was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax initiative coming in at 16% GAAP and 16.5% non-GAAP. GAAP EPS was $1.99, non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 3.5-point drag from the stronger dollar. Through the first three weeks of February, business trends have remained strong and stable. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 14% with debit up 13% and credit up 14%. Lapping of Omicron-related weakness from last year has contributed to strong January month-to-date growth. The Omicron-related uptick will fade as we get into February. These trends are generally consistent with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 14% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 36% year-over-year and was 42% over 2019 and 32% over 2020. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 75% above 2019 and 52% above 2020. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 25% above 2019 and 20% above 2020. We are now past the pandemic recovery stage on domestic volumes and transactions. As such, starting next quarter, we will no longer provide comparisons to 2019 for payments volumes and processed transactions. Since the cross-border recovery is still ongoing, we will continue to provide comparisons to 2019 for cross-border volumes through this calendar year. Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter. For the second quarter, we are assuming that trends in domestic payments volume and processed transactions are sustained with some benefit from lapping Omicron in January last year. As a reminder, discontinuation of operations in Russia will impact reported payments volume growth rates in the second quarter. Russia will not impact reported processed transaction growth. Cross-border e-commerce trends have been stable, too, especially when you adjust for Russia and crypto-related volatility. We're resuming cross-border e-commerce growth rates sustained through the second quarter, ex Russia and crypto. The cross-border travel recovery continued generally in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We are assuming recent trends to sustain into the second quarter. We expect most of the Mainland China travel recovery in the second half and beyond for reasons I outlined earlier. We expect outbound travel from Mainland China to recover first. The pace of inbound travel recovery will depend on the COVID situation. Discontinuation of operations in Russia will reduce second quarter net revenue growth by almost 5 points since we recorded nearly two quarters' worth of service fees in the second quarter of fiscal year '22. Based on where the dollar is today and the forward curve, exchange rates will reduce reported net revenue growth in the second quarter by about 2 points. When you put all this together, our planning assumptions get us to mid-teens constant dollar net revenue growth in the second quarter on a run rate basis i.e., adjusted for Russia. With an almost 5-point Russia impact and a 2-point exchange rate headwind, reported nominal dollar Q2 net revenue growth would be in the high single digits. Client incentives were below our 26.5% to 27.5% range of gross revenues in the first quarter. Second quarter client incentives are expected to run higher at the upper end of the range, finishing the first half in the middle of the range. As we indicated in October, operating expenses growth rates will moderate through the year as we reduce the rate of increase as well as lap higher levels from last year. In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating expense growth in nominal dollars is expected to be 2 points to 3 points lower than the first quarter expense growth. Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expense growth rate is expected to decline an additional 2 points to 3 points, with a further 2 point to 3 point reduction in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items and the litigation provision from the third quarter last year. We currently expect non-GAAP non-operating expense to be in the $40 million to $50 million range in the second quarter, driven largely by higher interest income from our cash balances. Our tax rate is expected to be at the upper end of the 19% to 19.5% range for the rest of the year. With a non-GAAP 16.5% rate in the first quarter, the full year non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to range between 18.5% to 19%. As we said last quarter, should there be a recession or a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our planning assumptions in the second half, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel and other controllable categories. In a business like ours, this always requires a careful balance between short- and long-term considerations. We have contingency plans in place and will activate them should we need to. Our business has been resilient so far this year. Our first quarter performance has demonstrated strong consumer payments growth from cash digitization and client wins. New flows and value-added services momentum remains very strong. There is still much uncertainty from an economic standpoint in the months ahead. We will remain vigilant and ready to act. As we look past fiscal year '23, we remain as optimistic as we've ever been about the long-term growth potential of our business.  Before I finish, this is a sad day for me personally. It's Al's last week as CEO. Al has been the best CEO I've worked for and I've worked for many in my career. Al is a wonderful human being, an exceptional leader with extraordinary business judgment. It has been an eventful six years. Despite a three-year global pandemic, revenues have almost doubled, non-GAAP EPS is up over 2.5x and our stock price has tripled during Al's tenure. I will miss you as CEO, Al, along with 26,500 or so others at Visa.  With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\nJennifer Como : Thanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Thanks, and congratulations to Al and Ryan as well. Vasant, as we think about your baseline plan forecast, how are you factoring in the economy? I mean, are we assuming resilient consumer, stable economy or are you assuming some mild downturn?\nVasant Prabhu : Well, we went through what we call our planning assumptions last -- on the last call for the full year, and we told you we had assumed no recession. As you can see, business trends have been remarkably stable. The spend levels just around the world, they've indexed in the mid-140s for almost four quarters right now, and there's no evidence of a change in trend. That's reflected in our second quarter outlook. At this point, we're not changing any expectations for the second half. I mean, clearly, the dollar has weakened a bit so that will change the exchange rate impact in the second half, but we're not changing any of our views in the second half. I mean, they are planning assumptions. And if there is a slowdown, then we will react accordingly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller : So it's nice to see that -- it seems like from the trends you're seeing in Q1 and what you're guiding for Q2 is an element of conservatism based on the trends so far relative to what we could see in the second half, which I think is what The Street probably wanted. But when we just think about the underlying trends for a moment, I mean, some of the strength we're seeing, like debit being up still high single digits constant currency in the U.S. on really tough comps, combined with other services. Maybe you could just touch on what's the driving forces of both of those metrics because they were a little better than we thought. And I don't know if it's Visa Direct in the debit side helping or it's other factors on share, and then if you could comment on other revenue strength.\nVasant Prabhu : Yes. On debit, it's what we told you earlier. In general, if you look at the -- looking at 2019 has kept us honest, so to speak. It's a good view of what's going on. And there's -- in total spend, it's remarkable stability. What's happening is as good spending slowed down a bit, services spending really took up all the slack. And so consumers have just shifted their spending but they're spending the same amount, and that's why debit has stayed resilient. Debit has been the biggest beneficiary of the move to digitization that happened globally and including in the U.S., more e-commerce, more tap-to-pay, more people using digital credentials just about on any payment occasion. So some people were worried that when things settle down, that debit might start to see some slowdown. But as you've seen, debit has stayed resilient even as credit has recovered, which has kept our overall payment volumes very stable. Those would be the big trends and the other question?\nJennifer Como : Other revenue.\nVasant Prabhu : And other revenue was helped by mostly marketing services and consulting revenue, a fair amount of that linked to the FIFA World Cup. There was a lot of client-related marketing and spending related to the World Cup. Clients ask us to activate a variety of programs and that certainly helped the revenue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs.\nWill Nance : Wanted to kind of double click on some of the comments you made around China. It sounds like you guys are looking towards that region as being a fairly big driver of continued recovery in cross-border travel. I think we heard this morning from your competitor that those volumes in aggregate seem to only be something like 1% to 2% of overall cross-border volumes pre COVID. So was wondering, given how much of a focus this is for investors as a driver of continued strong growth, can you put some guardrails around how we should be thinking about the magnitude of impact of China once it's fully reopened relative to kind of what we saw in the most recent quarter?\nAl Kelly: Well, a couple of things. First, our numbers are fairly close to those of our competitor. We are -- as Vasant said, we really think that, first, we're going to see the travel outbound from China to Southeast Asia. I think it's going to be still a bit of time before we're going to see a Chinese traveler back in Europe at the level of pre pandemic or back in the United States at the level of pre-pandemic. And I think it's going to -- people are going to wait and see what's happening with COVID within China. So Vasant talked about the fact that we're not counting on any kind of recovery that inbound into China into the second half of the year. But my personal expectation is that we'll see probably a spread of three to five quarters before, starting in the second half before China gets back to a level of pre pandemic or 2019. So it is -- for us, it's -- we have built our plan around pretty much what Vasant said in his remarks and what I just said. And if China comes back faster than we're saying, then obviously, that will help us. If it comes back slower, it will have the opposite impact.\nVasant Prabhu : Yes. I mean, in terms of thinking about the impact, you all and we all have been tracking how is our cross-border recovering relative to pre-COVID levels and are we back on the trend line and so on, as you know? And we've told you now for a few quarters that many corridors, and I went through a lot of that, are well above the 2019 level. The three that were not and are still not, U.S. is approaching -- U.S. inbound is approaching 2019 levels and was held back by the strong dollar, but Asia is still -- and I went through the numbers, quite a bit below 2019 levels. Most of Asia is open, only China isn't. So if Asia is going to get back to pre-COVID levels and back to the original trend line, that's where the China impact is going to be visible. And then you expect and we expect that cross-border travel index to keep improving through the year. For that to happen, we obviously need China to come back. So it is important.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with SVB MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis : I had a question about the evolution of Visa Direct. You highlighted the plus 39% year-on-year growth ex Russia in the quarter. Over the last few years, you've been talking a lot with tap-to-pay and contactless about there being sort of this inflection point dynamic where you reach a certain level of critical mass and then growth really accelerates. Is this similar dynamic true for Visa Direct? And can you give us a sense for sort of how we should think about that evolve over the next couple of years?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think, Lisa, you're absolutely right. We're focused in Visa Direct at this point on extending into new geographies, new use cases and more cross-border. I would say those are our focuses. Initially out of the chute, Visa Direct in a country goes through Phase 1, which tends to be P2P before you then get into things like gig economy payouts and transactions like remittances or insurance payments, those kinds of things. So in the United States, and every country is going to go through this kind of evolution where they'll start with P2P, get into things like gig economy payouts and then get into more sophistic and remittances and then more sophisticated use cases. And the United States is much further along that continuum. In other countries, we are -- some good progress kind of in that first phase or 2 but haven't gotten into more sophisticated use cases. And then in other geographies, frankly, we're still not there. So I think there's a tremendous amount of gas left in the tank in Visa Direct. When I look at the opportunities to take use cases to more sophisticated levels in more markets, to open up more markets and to put a real focus on cross-border Visa Direct transactions, which we'll have better yields to them as well. So I think your bottom line theory of your question is -- has some real legitimacy to it, although I would say that it will be probably a bit longer elevation -- a bit longer period of time before you meet the maturity simply because of the different amount of use cases, whereas tap-to-pay is really kind of a single type of initiative.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.\nDavid Koning : Good job. I guess my question, rest of world debit is the one place where I guess, numbers were a little weaker than we had thought, negative 2% on constant currency. Is that just a function of portfolio deconversions, Russia, some of the one-off things? And when does that kind of inflect back into positive territory?\nAl Kelly: I think, Dave, when you look at it ex China and ex Russia, it grew over 10%. And then, yes, the UK migrations, in particular, are happening at a faster pace than we thought. And as Vasant said in his remarks, they're almost fully migrated, so certainly, that is having a dragging impact on the growth as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal : Al, could you give us your latest thoughts on sort of balance sheet deployment, M&A strategy, what you might be looking for, whether this environment is yielding more potential opportunities or deals? Or is it time maybe to not pursue additional deals as the macro environment remains volatile?\nAl Kelly: Nothing has changed in our strategy. We're focused, first and foremost, on organic growth and then growing through M&A, and then from there, dividend and share buybacks in that order. Clearly, there's been a little bit of a burst of the balloon in terms of some of the valuations, in particular, in the fintech world. That's a helpful characteristic of the environment right now. But I think we will continue to look for capabilities and management teams that would bring more value to Visa than we could bring to ourselves organically. And we're in constant evaluation of options. We have a very good corporate development team. It's something that Ryan and Vasant, in particular, spent a good deal of time on. And when we see something that we think will make us better as a company and has a fair value attached to it, we're not afraid to go after it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette : And thanks for all the work and effort, Al, over time. And I wanted to address kind of a bigger picture question for you and maybe for Ryan, is that one of the questions we get a lot from investors is how do we think about kind of the challenges as we eventually reach some level of maturation of card penetration, especially in the U.S. and developed markets, especially given some of the preferences we've seen in other countries for them to develop domestic schemes or at least favor domestic schemes. So just wondering if you can provide a little bit of reflection on what we've seen thus far, and maybe, Ryan, some ideas on how we should think about kind of maturation and expansion issues going forward.\nAl Kelly: I'll start, and then certainly, Ryan, can add. First, I would say that I believe deeply that there is tremendous opportunity in the card -- traditional card world, both in the consumer space as well as in the B2B space. There are still hundreds and hundreds of millions of people to bring into the financial mainstream. There are still trillions of dollars spent on cash and check. And when you look in the B2B space, we see a total addressable market of about $120 billion across carded opportunities, cross-border and payables and receivables, where I talked a bunch about a number of examples that we have worked on over the course of the last quarter. RTP systems are helping to digitize money movement. That's a good thing. If you look at the disruption caused by monetization in India, it ended up being extraordinarily positive in terms of what it's done in terms of growth in card credentials as well as acceptance, which by the way, I also should have said in the traditional world, there's still a tremendous opportunity to grow our acceptance footprint from the level that it's at today. These RTP systems are also helping us and we're leaning into them. They're helping us extend the reach of Visa Direct as we utilize them as part of our network-of-network strategies. They're helping us with open banking through Tink, where we can facilitate greater access to more developers on 1 end and more financial institutions on the other end. I think RTPs represent an opportunity for us to sell value-added services. And I still think the advantages of -- and the capabilities associated with the carded space are still far superior to account that the consumer protections, et cetera. And if you look at PICs in Brazil, you look at UPI in India, these things developed and were put in the marketplace, and we're seeing a fair amount of -- hearing a lot from clients in terms of fraud associated with these networks. And in many ways, that makes sense. They haven't spent the decades and hundreds of millions of dollars that Visa has to build security, fraud capability, risk management capabilities that help keep the ecosystem secure and trusted by consumers. And I think we have the opportunity over time in the A2A space to bring some of those capabilities and earn some good revenue and yield from them. So Ryan, what would you add to it?\nRyan McInerney : Not a lot to add to that, Al. It's great. I mean, James, just in short, we still see a ton of runway. We love our products. We love our people. We love our brand. We love our position and all these markets, whether they're mature or emerging around the world. So tons of runway.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.\nDaniel Perlin : Al, I just wanted to ask a question about how when you look at the new business that you've won, let's say, in the past 12, maybe even 18 months or so, how that kind of sets Visa up as we think about the next, I would say the next two years, not really much beyond that. But the question really here is, is it tilting to take advantage more of debit trends, credit trends, global hospitality? And I'm kind of asking because MasterCard kind of called it out this morning is their positioning in travel, and it sounds like you were also kind of hinting at some positioning for your business. So I would just be interested to know what that new business pipeline that you brought in suggests over the course of the next two years for your company.\nAl Kelly: Well, I'd say a couple of things, Dan. Number one, on the travel front, it's been a focus for us for a long time. And I think we have about 650 co-brands around the world. Many of them are travel co-brands, and I think we're the leading co-brand player on the planet. I think that when I look around the world, there's certainly opportunities with traditional issuers. We've made a lot of inroads in markets like Brazil and Chile, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan over the past year. We've had some great renewals in the United States over the last couple of years from JPMorgan Chase to Wells to the ones I talked about today in terms of Bank of America, Cap One, Commerce Bank.  But we've also made great inroads with fintechs and neobanks. We have had a great track record of wins in the last 24 to 36 months. And a lot of these people are getting to scale in their particular markets. And I think for us, we have to have a wider lens in terms of who can provide services. We're trying to get -- make sure we get Visa cards in as many wallets as we can around the world. And then I'm going to come back to acceptance. One of the great ways to continue to grow our business is to grow our acceptance footprint, which still requires a lot of growth around the world. One of the places we've concentrated on that in the last 1.5 years is Latin America. And if you look at the ratio of spending in Latin America that went from -- moved from cash to PV in the last couple of years. Back in full year 2020, only 46% of Latin America's volume was PV, with 54% being cash. This past quarter, we just finished [59%] of their PV -- [69%] of their volume was purchase volume, so there was a 13-point swing in the Latin America region in the last not even quite three years. And that's a combination of winning with traditional FIs, winning with fintechs, having a localized market-by-market approach with a lot of good -- really good progress in countries that's out in Latin America like Brazil and Chile.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat : Al, best wishes to you and we'll miss hearing from you on this call. Ryan, congratulations. Can you talk about how business growth strategy in organization that has evolved under your leadership? Are you starting to focus more or less on certain things or do some things differently? And Vasant very quickly, can you comment under your decel from your fourth fiscal quarter to 1Q? You talked about some of the dynamics, but how is that relative to your initial expectations?\nAl Kelly: Harshita, I don't think we got the second half of your question because maybe we can knock that off, and then Ryan can talk -- you did?\nVasant Prabhu : I think you were asking about -- you said decel, I'm assuming you meant deceleration between the first and the second?\nHarshita Rawat : Yes.\nVasant Prabhu : Yes. I mean, just a couple of things. The Russia impact is a little larger in the second quarter because we had almost two quarters' worth of service fees last year. Remember, we recognize service fees with a lag, so the service fees recognized in the first quarter were based on Q4 growth rates. So sequentially, Q1 was a little lower, so Q2 service fees will be impacted by that. Also, currency volatility is moderating as we speak. It has been moderating for a few weeks. And incentive growth is a little higher as you saw. So you put it all together, we were a little better than we expected. As you know, we thought we would be high single digits in the first quarter. We were higher for the reasons I mentioned, will be high single digits in the second quarter. That's our expectation right now.\nAl Kelly: Ryan?\nRyan McInerney : Yes, on the first part of your question, I've been a President now for close to 10 years, so I've been shoulder to shoulder with Al and Vasant and the rest of our team as we've made all of our key decisions, as we've developed our strategy, as we've executed our strategy. So probably won't or shouldn't surprise you, I'm going to continue to focus on the three growth pillars that we've laid out, consumer payments, new inflows and value-added services. And my priorities are going to be focused on doing everything that we can to accelerate our progress and accelerate our momentum. So how do we go to market, how do we work with clients, how do we ship product faster, how do we sell solutions more effectively to our clients? And to part of your question, how do we organize. So earlier this month, I announced a new organizational structure that really reflects our strategy that we talked with all of you about all the time. And we believe it's going to help us accelerate our progress in all 3 of those growth factors. To give you a quick sketch of that, Oliver Jenkyn, long-time Visa veteran, who many of you know, is going to lead a new global markets organization that includes driving our consumer payments growth in all of our markets around the world. So our five regional presidents will report to Oliver. Chris Newkirk, who formally led our strategy organization, is going to lead our new flows business unit reporting directly to me. Antony Cahill, who is our former Deputy CEO of Europe, is going to lead our value-added services business unit reporting directly to me. So our global markets team, our value-added services business unit, our new flows business unit, all will report directly to me. And then just to round that out a little bit, Jack Forestell, who also many of you know, will become our Chief Product and Strategy Officer and will partner closely with our President of Technology, Rajat Taneja. And the two of them are focused on delivering a robust product and innovation road map, shipping world-class products and services that help our clients grow their businesses and deepen their relationships with their customers. So that gives you a sense of where we are with strategy and the organization.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research.\nKenneth Suchoski : Thanks for taking the question and congrats to Al and Ryan. I think you mentioned earlier that you're keeping the second half guidance unchanged. Can you just remind us what that guidance was from either a volume or a net revenue standpoint? Just because I think we have only the prior kind of full year guidance, and I know there's FX that's becoming less of a headwind as you get into the second half.\nVasant Prabhu : Yes. When we talked to you last quarter, we said for the full year revenue growth would be somewhere in the mid-teens on a constant dollar basis adjusted for Russia. And then when you adjust for Russia and you adjust for a full year impact at that time of about 2 points on FX, it was going to be high single digits in nominal dollars. And so you know sort of where we are in Q1 and Q2. And exchange rates have moved around some so you can do some of the math. We're basically not changing any views on the second half right now because trends have been still fairly stable. The only thing you might want to change is what the exchange rate impact in the second half might be based on where these are right now. I also gave you fairly clear operating expense expectations. We were about 15% growth in the first quarter. We said growth will be 2 points to 3 points lower in nominal dollar terms in the second quarter, another 2 points to 3 points lower in the third quarter and another 2 points to 3 points lower in the fourth quarter. And that reflects what we had said last quarter that is expense growth will moderate through the year, both as we moderate the rate of increase when also as we lap higher levels of expenses from last year. So those pretty much are the sort of the broad outlines of what we said last quarter. And then we'll update you once again on our next call with any changes we might have based on trends.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Thanks so much, and congrats to Al and Ryan. Excited for both of you. On the renewal front and new deal front, I'll ask on that if you don't mind. Any call-outs on pricing contract requirements, that kind of thing? I know you'd named a bunch of big names on the renewal front. MasterCard talked about the Citizens win there. Just curious what's happening in the whole balance of trade area?\nAl Kelly: Well, it's a competitive world out there, Tien-tsin, as you well know. I think that there's a price that you need to get to and then a lot of it has to do with the combination of incumbency or not, the capabilities you have, what your line-up of customers' clients are in that market, what kind of experience you've had, what kind of innovative ideas you bring to the table, the other kinds of capabilities that we have in terms of services and new flows. So every deal is different and potentially hinging on on different things depending upon the needs of a particular client. And we tried to be very bespoke when we look at deals and talk to clients because their needs and their situation will always tend to be a bit different.\nJennifer Como : And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter results were very strong with $9.6 billion in net revenue, up 12% year-over-year and EPS up 16%. Our key business drivers were relatively stable compared to Q3. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year, U.S. payments volume grew 5% and international payments volume grew 10%. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 13%, and processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. As I reflect on this quarter and the full fiscal year, I am incredibly proud of the more than 31,000 Visa employees who have been focused on delivering our strategy and enabling our clients with compelling solutions, which resulted in the company's strong performance. We have continued to grow our consumer payments business through an intense focus on product design and innovation. In new flows, our targeted strategy for non-consumer payments is paying off. And in value-added services, we have deepened our relationships with our clients through multiple different solutions and continue to expand our services to non-Visa transactions. We have done all this while further increasing our suite of solutions. Now let's dive into some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and the year. In consumer payments, we continued to increase credentials and acceptance. We have over 4.6 billion credentials, up 7% year-over-year and 11.5 billion tokens with more than 30% of our total transactions tokenized. Global merchant locations crossed 150 million. The Olympics and Paralympics certainly helped, with more than 7 million Paris 2024 branded cards issued and more than 130,000 merchant locations added in Europe. And I am particularly excited about new acceptance use cases. For example, we renewed an agreement with Canelo, a leading provider of self-service commerce across sectors such as food and beverage automated retail with over 1 million active devices globally and more than 1 billion transactions annually. And in the Netherlands, we reached an agreement with the country's largest grocer, Albert Heijn to expand in-store acceptance to all Visa products. We also recently renewed our agreement with AppFolio in the U.S. for rental payments acceptance. AppFolio is one of the largest software providers in the property management space and services 8 million-plus units across more than 20,000 clients. Throughout the year, we have continued to innovate in order to expand Visa's capabilities to non-card payments. This quarter, we announced Visa A2A, bringing the power of Visa's brand, infrastructure, and rules as well as consumer protections to enable simpler, safer and more secure account-to-account payments. We are excited to be collaborating with several banks, including NatWest and Nationwide Building Society and several leading fintechs, including Modulr to deliver an industry-driven solution to unlock the full potential of account-to-account transactions in the UK. And Visa A2A is open, open to any eligible bank, open banking provider, and verified biller. Initially, this is targeted at bill payments and we plan to launch in 2025 in the UK. We are very excited to bring this to market. In prior quarters, I've mentioned our account-to-account fraud risk scoring solution, Visa Protect for A2A payments. It was recently announced as Juniper Research's Platinum Winner for Fraud and Security Innovation of the Year Award, and we will be piloting on 10 new RTP networks in 2025. We're also seeing very strong interest in our new Flexible Credential, which enables multiple payment options from one Visa credential. We have hundreds of issuers in the pipeline and several launches planned for 2025 in the U.S., Asia Pacific, Europe, and CEMEA. Last quarter, I mentioned the expansion of tapping use cases on a mobile device. Tap to add card is now enabled by issuers in more than 15 countries across our 5 regions. We know that transit is a key activator for tapping and global tap-to-ride transactions exceeded 2 billion for the first time in fiscal year 2024, up 25% year-over-year. We added more than 110 new transit systems throughout the year in cities such as Boston, Athens, Beijing, Las Vegas, and Lima to total over 870 globally. And more than 40% of these new systems also use our value-added services acceptance solutions. Tap to Pay penetration globally, excluding the U.S., was at 82%, up 6 points from 2023. And in the U.S., it was at 54%, up 13 points from last year with 29 out of the top 30 U.S. merchants accepting Tap to Pay. Now pivoting to some deal highlights. We had some significant renewals this quarter around the globe: first, with one of our largest clients in Latin America, Grupo Promerica in credit, debit, and commercial across 8 countries; second, with our largest Asia Pacific client, SMCC across consumer and commercial credit; third, with our largest CEMEA client, Al Rajhi across consumer, commercial, and value-added services, including CyberSource and Visa Risk Manager, our network-agnostic risk product; and across both Asia Pacific and CEMEA, with Standard Chartered Bank, a credit renewal across key markets in Asia, a debit renewal with key markets in Africa as well as a new expansion in the Middle East for credit. In addition, they will continue to use our value-added services. In North America, we had three very important renewals: in Canada, we renewed our relationship with the country's top issuer, RBC across consumer credit and debit, small business credit, and commercial credit; in the U.S., we recently extended our long-standing partnership with US Bank to grow our relationship across their consumer and commercial portfolios. And we have renewed with USAA across both their consumer debit and credit portfolios. Finally, in Europe, building upon our strong relationship in Italy and across 11 other markets, we are pleased to have renewed the strategic agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo, expanding our collaboration in Italy with the largest bank in the country for innovative solutions amongst businesses and consumers. In addition, together, we will enable new value-added services for their Visa customers. Across all of our regions and all of our fintech partners from early stage to mature, we signed over 650 commercial partnerships, up 30% from last year. As you can see, we have continued to grow our businesses through active engagement with our clients and a relentless focus on new product innovations. Now moving to new flows, where our targeted strategy for capturing newer areas of growth is paying off. This quarter, new flows revenue grew 22% year-over-year in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions grew 38% for the quarter to 2.8 billion, and commercial volumes grew 5% year-over-year. We finished the year with almost 10 billion Visa Direct transactions and $1.7 trillion in commercial payments volume. Commercial credentials grew at 18% year-over-year, significantly faster than the 7% growth for total credentials that I mentioned earlier. We are very focused on growing B2B in new verticals such as travel. We are pleased to announce that we signed a virtual card issuing deal with JPMorgan Chase in Europe. This is a significant opportunity for Visa to further build on our strong issuing relationship in North America as well as further grow in the B2B travel vertical. Additionally, in Europe, we will be partnering with Adyen so that they can offer online travel agencies, or OTAs, Visa virtual cards as part of their B2B travel solution. Another area of focus is the cross-border B2B space, where we offer significant value for complex payments through both card and Visa B2B Connect. For Visa B2B Connect, we increased the number of banks that have signed on by almost 40% year-over-year, and the number of transacting banks is up nearly 60%. In Korea, we reached two agreements with Hana Card. The first is a commercial and consumer credit and debit issuance partnership, with enhanced multicurrency capabilities targeted towards the cross-border needs of its customers. The second is an agreement with Hana Card and the Government Trade Agency, KOTRA, so that small business exporters can receive cross-border B2B payments via card. In Canada, we are very pleased to have won the multicurrency credit issuance with fintech Loop, a cross-border banking platform for Canadian-based SMBs. In addition, our cross-border capabilities through Currencycloud will provide FX solutions across accounts, digital wallets and international payments. In Australia, we reached a multicurrency commercial debit agreement with OFX, a leading global money transfer company that offers foreign exchange services, international payment, and spend management controls. Now moving to Visa Direct, where we have continued to grow through new and expanded relationships. In Europe, we expanded our existing cross-border P2P partnership with Revolut to now allow real-time card transfers for their business customers via the Visa Direct platform in over 78 countries supporting over 50 currencies. In the U.S., we are excited about an expanded partnership with DailyPay, whose users are currently accessing earnings on demand via Visa Direct to now seamlessly send those earnings as international remittances to friends and family around the world. In Brazil, we reached a new agreement with Travelex Banco de Cambio, one of the largest foreign exchange banks in the country and the first to specialize in FX operations regulated by the Central Bank. The client will use Visa Direct for import and export payments and for remittances to a broad range of destinations. So across our new flows, we have seen our specific strategies succeeding in the marketplace. And now on to value-added services, where revenue was up 22% in the fourth quarter and full year in constant dollars. Let's look at the progress we have made across our value-added services. In our issuing solutions, our core banking and issuer processing platform, Pismo has a good pipeline and its solutions are resonating with clients with nearly 12 billion API calls a month. Recently, Pismo renewed its agreement with Itau in Brazil. And in 2025, we plan to expand Pismo's offerings to clients in more than 5 countries across four regions. In Risk and Identity Solutions, we recently announced our intent to acquire Featurespace, a developer of real-time artificial intelligence payments protection technology. It will enable Visa to provide enhanced fraud prevention tools to our clients and protect consumers in real-time across various payment methods. And Worldline, already a Visa partner and leading European acquirer, will soon be launching an optimized fraud management solution, utilizing Decision Manager to provide businesses with AI-based e-commerce fraud detection capabilities. In acceptance, food delivery platform, Foodpanda, has been a long-standing CyberSource client in Asia across several markets. They will also soon be using our AI-powered data token solution, which we announced earlier this year, enabling customers to control how their data is used to experience tailored shopping experiences. In Advisory Services, Visa Consulting and Analytics delivered more than 3,000 consulting engagements during the year, and we estimate that we helped clients realize over $5 billion of incremental revenue as a result. So our value-added services have continued to show strong momentum across both Visa and non-Visa transactions and nonpayment value-added services. Before I close, I wanted to make a few comments on the recent lawsuit by the Department of Justice. We believe the lawsuit is meritless and shows a clear lack of understanding of the payments ecosystem in the United States. We will defend ourselves vigorously and are confident in our ability to demonstrate that Visa competes for every transaction in a thriving debit space that continues to grow and see new entrants. In closing, I am proud of our team and all that we have accomplished. We delivered on our financial expectations while also investing in Visa's future through important product innovation. Back at 2020 at our Investor Day, we set a goal for new flows and value-added services revenue to represent more than 30% of net revenue by the end of 2024. I am pleased to say that we have exceeded that goal. And we will be hosting another Investor Day on February 20, 2025, here in San Francisco when we can talk more about our strategy to continue growing value-added services, new flows, and consumer payments. I see tremendous opportunity ahead and feel confident in our plans to get us there. Now over to Chris.\nChris Suh : Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. We closed the year with another strong quarter. In Q4, we saw relatively stable growth across payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions when compared to Q3. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year and cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was up 13% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenue was up 12%, above our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives, stronger-than-expected other revenue and FX being less of a drag than expected. Net revenue was also up 12% in constant dollars. EPS was up 16% year-over-year and 17% in constant dollars, higher than expected from the strong net revenue performance and a lower-than-expected tax rate. Let's go into the details. In the U.S., total payments volume grew 5% year-over-year, in line with Q3. Credit and debit also each grew 5%. Card-present volume grew 2% and card-not-present volume grew 6%. Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable to Q3. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments from last quarter. Moving to international markets. Total payments volume was up 10% in constant dollars, stable to Q3. In most major regions, payments volume year-over-year growth rates in constant dollars were strong for the quarter, with Latin America up 24%, CEMEA up 19%, and Europe up 12%. Asia Pacific payments volume saw a marginal improvement from Q3 in constant dollars for the quarter but was still less than 1% year-over-year growth, primarily due to the macroeconomic environment, most notably in Mainland China. Asia Pacific payments volume growth, excluding Mainland China, was relatively consistent to Q3. Now to cross-border volume, which I will speak to today in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 13% in Q4, below Q3, in line with our expectations. Q4 cross-border e-commerce measured as card-not-present volume, excluding travel and crypto purchases, grew 15%, which was faster than cross-border travel volume growth at 12%, in line with our expectations. Indexed to 2019, cross-border travel was relatively consistent with Q3. As we look at the travel corridors, the primary driver of the lower year-over-year cross-border travel volume growth was Asia Pacific inbound and outbound, which continued to be impacted by the same primary factors we've been mentioning all year: macroeconomic conditions, currency weakness, and flight bookings being below pre-COVID levels. We also saw a step-down in CEMEA outbound travel volume growth compared to Q3 due to Ramadan timing. Normalized for this, the CEMEA growth was stable. Now let's review our fourth quarter financial results. I'll start with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 8% year-over-year versus the 7% growth in Q3 constant dollar payments volume due to mix and improving utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenue grew 8% versus 10% processed transaction growth primarily due to fees and penalties being lower than the prior year. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 13% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping higher currency volatility from last year, even with the average quarterly volatility being slightly higher in Q4 versus Q3. Other revenue grew 30%, primarily driven by strong marketing services revenue growth related to the Olympics, consulting and, to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 6%. As expected, Q4 was the annual low point for year-over-year growth due to lapping significant renewals from the prior year. In addition, it was further lowered from some onetime adjustments due to client performance. While Ryan mentioned a significant amount of renewal activity in his remarks, the majority of that impact will begin in Q1 of '25. Now on to our three growth engines. Consumer payments revenue growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transaction growth. New flows revenue grew 22% year-over-year in constant dollars, helped by a onetime rebate adjustment due to deal timing. Visa Direct transactions grew 38% year-over-year helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Commercial volume rose 5% year-over-year in constant dollars, below Q3, primarily due to days mix. Value-added services revenue grew 22% in constant dollars to $2.4 billion, led by strong growth in marketing services and consulting and issuing solutions. Operating expenses grew 11%, led by increases in marketing and personnel expenses. FX was a minimal drag instead of the 0.5 point benefit we had expected. Our acquisition of Pismo represented an approximately 0.5 point drag as well. Non-operating income was $69 million. Our tax rate was 16.5% due to an update in our tax position across jurisdictions. EPS was $2.71, up 16% over last year, with an approximately 1 point drag from exchange rates and an approximately 0.5 point drag from Pismo. In Q4, we bought back approximately $5.8 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. We also funded the litigation escrow account by $1.5 billion, which has the same effect as a stock buyback. At the end of September, we had $13.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. As we closed out fiscal 2024 and readied for fiscal 2025, I reflected on our full year performance relative to what we had expected at the start of the year. With the strong Q4, full year net revenue grew 10%, in line with our expectations, and EPS grew 15%, above our expectations, a testament to Visa's diversified business model. Volatility started strong in Q1 but then declined and remained at lower-than-expected levels throughout most of the year. For incentives, we anticipated year-over-year growth will be lower than fiscal 2023 due primarily to smaller impacts from renewals in fiscal 2024. The growth rate ended up being even lower than we expected due to client performance adjustments and deal timing. On the business driver front, processed transactions grew 10% as expected. Payments volume grew 8% in constant dollars, below expectations due to a combination of weakness in Asia Pacific, as we have discussed, and in the U.S. from ticket size not improving as expected and, to a lesser extent, from the Reg II impact. Total cross-border volume growth, excluding intra-Europe, was 15% in constant dollars, generally in line with our original expectations, though the growth in cross-border travel volume was lower, primarily due to Asia Pacific travel and card-not-present excluding travel volume growth, performed better than we expected. As we've seen this year, volumes and transactions can swing quarter-to-quarter. As these drivers fluctuate, we work carefully to manage our business to deliver on our expectations. So as we thought about our budget and guidance philosophy going into fiscal 2025, it's largely the same approach and represents our best view based on today. So let's get into the guidance details and a quick note. When I reference 2024 and 2025, I'm referring to our fiscal years. As we regularly say, we are not economic forecasters so we're assuming the macroeconomic environment stays generally where it is today. As such, we expect payments volume and processed transaction growth to remain strong and generally in line with full year 2024 levels. For cross-border volumes, we expect the Q4 '24 trend to generally continue with card-not-present excluding travel volume growing slightly more than travel volume. Now let's cover our underlying assumptions for net revenue growth. First, volatility. We're expecting that the full year currency volatility levels are roughly in line with the Q4 '24 average, which implies that volatility will no longer be a drag starting with Q2 '25. Next, pricing. We will continue to price to value in 2025 with the pricing impact being generally the same as 2024. However, the cadence is expected to be different as we expect the vast majority of the incremental pricing impact will take effect in April versus being more balanced between October and April as it was in 2024. On incentives, first, there were a significant amount of renewals in Ryan's remarks that will be impacting Q1 '25 incentives. In total, we expect more than 20% of our payments volume to be impacted by renewals in 2025 compared to less than 15% that was impacted in 2024. Second, remember that in the first and second quarters of 2024, we called out client performance and deal timing as helping incentives. And in Q4, we had additional onetime performance adjustments. Adding this up, 2025 year-over-year incentives growth is expected to be significantly higher than 2024. We expect to close on Prosa and Featurespace in 2025, and when we do, we will update our estimates for the acquisition impacts. We pulled these assumptions together on an adjusted basis, defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentations for more detail. In 2025, we expect full year adjusted net revenue growth to be in the high single to low double digits, with incentives being the key driver of the difference between '24 and 2025. As always, revenue performance is sensitive to several factors so to the extent that there are deal delays or significant deal performance adjustments and or macro volatility and driver performance that is better than expected, adjusted net revenue growth would be on the higher end of the range. In terms of quarterly variability, we expect the second half revenue performance to be better than the first due to some of the dynamics I have spoken about, volatility, pricing and, to a lesser extent, incentives. Now moving to expenses. We currently expect to grow adjusted operating expense in the high single digit to low double digits as we continue to fund new flows and value-added services projects, our sales efforts and growth initiatives in specific countries. Non-operating income is expected to be between $150 million and $200 million as a result of lower interest rates. Our tax rate is expected to be between 18% and 18.5%. On capital return, the Board has declared an increase to our quarterly dividend by 13%, and we intend to return excess free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks. All this results in adjusted EPS growth to be in the high end of low double digits. Now moving to Q1. For the first three weeks of October through the 21st, with volume growth in constant dollars, U.S. payments volume was up 6%, with debit up 7% and credit up 6% year-over-year. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, grew 13% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 11% year-over-year. Now to financial expectations. We expect Q1 adjusted net revenue growth in the high single digits. Three things to note when we look at the step-down in adjusted net revenue growth from the fourth quarter in 2024 to the first quarter in 2025. First, incentives. There are a number of factors impacting incentives, especially in Q1 and H1 so let me go through each part. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 incentives growth was even lower than expected, with the combined impact of the lapping of significant renewals in 2023 and the onetime adjustments due to client performance. As I also mentioned, in 2025, we expect a significantly higher amount of our payments volume to be impacted by renewals, approximately 20% compared to under 15% in 2024. This is a combination of the large amount of renewals in Q4 '24 that will go into effect plus the amount of renewals we expect in 2025. In addition, the timing of the deal terms in 2025 is such that we expect about 60% of the 2025 renewal volume to go into effect in Q1. Putting those all together, we expect a significant step-up in the dollar amount of incentives from Q4 of '24 to Q1 of '25. Second, the timing of pricing actions. As I mentioned, whereas in 2024, the pricing impact was similar quarter-to-quarter, this year, we expect less pricing impact in the first half than the back half with Q1 having the smallest impact. Third, other revenue. As we do not have a major event in Q1 like the Olympics or FIFA, we anticipate lower growth in consulting and marketing services-related revenue compared to Q4. We expect adjusted operating expense growth to be in the high single digit to low double digits. On a year-over-year basis, remember that the first quarter of 2024 had a lower operating expense growth rate, both from lapping FIFA-related expenses in 2023 and from the allocation of Olympic-related marketing spend to other quarters. Non-operating income is expected to be between $35 million and $45 million, and our tax rate is expected to be around 18.5%. This puts our first quarter adjusted EPS growth in the low double digits. As always, if the environment changes and there are events that impact our business, we will remain flexible and thoughtful on balancing short- and long-term considerations. As we are several weeks into fiscal 2025, Visa's underlying business continues to be healthy and the growth opportunities are significant. We look forward to discussing this and our long-term growth algorithm at the upcoming Investor Day. And now, Jennifer, I'll hand it back to you.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. A lot going on in the U.S. regulatory front with regards to the DoJ lawsuit, Reg II, MDL, CCA. Can you share your overall thoughts on the regulatory and litigation environment in the U.S.? And Chris, just as a follow-up, can you help us maybe size your revenue exposure to U.S. debit, both including as well as excluding Visa DPS? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah, thanks for the question. As you note, a lot going on not just in the U.S. but all over the world. I think regulators appropriately are looking at the payments ecosystem and want to ensure that there's fair competition, that there's multiple options, both for consumers and merchants. And that's a process of engagement that we have in the U.S. to your question, but also with regulators, elected officials all around the world. And we feel very good about our ability to manage through that complexity. We feel very good about the ability to continue to run and grow our business. And we feel very good about the ability to continue to innovate and to continue to serve our clients. In terms of revenue exposure, that's not something that we disclose as it relates to U.S. debit or other parts of the business like that. But in terms of our ability to compete, we feel really, really good about it.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal : Hi. Can you give us your updated thoughts on the competitive environment, especially as it pertains to or specifically as it pertains to pay by bank? We're seeing Walmart move forward with a new product and chatter around some other offerings. We've seen these products in the past, but I'm just wondering if there's anything that sort of changed on the ground to make these a little more interesting for consumers. I know you guys are involved as well serving that part of the market now, so curious to get your comments.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah, there's a lot going on with account-to-account payments in the U.S. and around the world as you know it as well. Pay by bank is not a new capability. It's not a new capability in the United States. It's not a new capability for Walmart. Actually, I think as of today, you can load three different bank accounts into your Walmart.com wallet to pay for things. And as you alluded to, they've also put some news out that they're going to have a new partnership that I think is going to further enhance that. We expect that account-to-account payments will continue to proliferate here and around the world. We think there's a lot that we can add in terms of value to account-to-account payments. I mentioned some of those things in my prepared remarks. But as I've talked about several times on this call, it's a very, very competitive environment in which we operate. But we feel very, very good about our products, our innovation, our ability to provide value to end users in terms of buyers and also sellers, and therefore, our ability to continue to grow the business.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. I had a question on commercial volumes. I know they decelerated in days mix. I'm just wondering what kind of growth rate we should expect on a go-forward basis. I mean -- and are there some macro impacts? Maybe just talk about that specifically.\nChris Suh : Hi, Sanjay, this is Chris. Yeah, as you noted, we did see a days mix impact in Q4 with commercial volumes. But if I just back way up, we're excited about the opportunity in new flows. We're optimistic about the big opportunity ahead. And over time, we do anticipate that we'll see continued growth of commercial volumes ahead of consumer volumes over time.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Paul Golding from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nPaul Golding : Thanks so much. With the Featurespace acquisition in process, I just wanted to ask how you see AI playing into the business model. Do you see it more as driving VAS or incremental business model, uplift revenue or cost improvement? Or is it more of a competitive differentiator that will just keep you ahead of your competition? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah, thank you. In short, I see it as both but let me unpack a couple of things that you said. First, in terms of Featurespace, we're very excited about the opportunity to close on the Featurespace acquisition. As I travel around the world, financial crime, fraud is at the top of mind of clients, partners, regulators all around the world. And Featurespace is a world leader in providing AI-driven solutions to combat that fraud, to reduce that fraud, to enable our clients and partners to continue to serve their customers in a safe way. So we're very excited about that. As it relates more broadly to especially Generative AI at Visa, I see it really in two different buckets. The first is we are adopting it aggressively across our company to drive productivity. And we've seen some great results from everywhere to our engineering teams, to our accounting teams, to our sales teams, our client service teams. And we're still in the early stages of, I think, the very significant impact this will have on the productivity of our business. I also see it as a real differentiator to the products and services that we're putting in market. You've heard me talk about some of the new risk capabilities, risk management capabilities, for example, that we've deployed in the account-to-account space, which are all enabled with generative AI. You mentioned Featurespace. We've had some really good success in other parts of both our value-added services business and the broader consumer payments business as well. And we've got a product pipeline that is very heavily tilted towards some, we think, very exciting Generative AI capabilities that hopefully you'll hear more from us on soon. One of those I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which was the data token that we're starting to pilot with Foodpanda, which is 1 example of that.\nPaul Golding : Thank you.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Thank you. Just wanted to ask how growth in '25 might look different than '24 across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services.\nChris Suh : Hi, Tien-Tsin. This is Chris. So we don't guide by consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. But let me just give you a little bit more color on how we think about the guide that we did give. At the highest level, we took the same approach to guidance as we did a year ago, which is really to provide guidance based on our best estimate of what we expect to happen throughout the year. And so if we take all our assumptions and those assumptions play out as we've articulated, we'd expect total revenue growth, adjusted net revenue growth to be in the middle of the range that we provided. And obviously, if those assumptions, those variables turn out to be better, that could push us to the high end of revenue growth, and vice versa if those assumptions turn out to be slightly worse. The key variables that I would call out are, there's three-- there's probably four here to talk about. So one is incentives. Our plan is based on our best estimate of renewals and deal activity. But as we saw in FY '24, those results can vary quarter-to-quarter with client performance and timing of deals, and lower growth could push revenue growth towards the upper end of the range. Two would be cross-border volumes. Higher or lower growth in cross-border volumes would also contribute toward higher or lower within that revenue range. Third would be volatility. We've assumed FY '25 full year on average to the levels that we saw in Q4, and any significant swing could impact revenue in '25. And of course, across all of it is the assumption on the macro economy. As we've always said, we're not forecasters of the economy. But in the event the U.S. -- in the U.S. or globally, if PC grows faster than currently forecasted, then we should also see stronger growth as well. And so all of these factors can play a role. We feel good about the plan that we shared here for the full year at the start of the year. And we'll obviously continue to update you as the year unfolds.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Rayna Kumar from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nRayna Kumar : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Last week, the CFPB issued a final open banking rule for the U.S. Can you talk about what opportunities this could present for Visa from Tink's perspective and what potential headwinds that could create? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney : My understanding is that the new rules that they, I guess, finalized are largely consistent with the CFPB's initial proposal. And we are strong advocates for consumers having more control and more access to the financial data but ensuring that it's in a safe and secure way. We're still evaluating all the details of the potential impacts from the more detailed regulations across the industry. But it goes without saying, our own capabilities will comply with the CFPB's rules as well as our clients' very high bar for security and privacy. Widening the aperture a little bit to the opportunities that it creates, I think in an environment that open banking is even more available in the United States, like it is in places like Europe, what we found is that the Visa brand can be a meaningful differentiator. The Visa brand can give confidence to end users and data providers, and that if we can bring our capabilities to market like we've done in Europe with Visa A2A, we can give more confidence to the whole ecosystem and help resolve a lot of the complexities that exist in open banking. So we remain excited about the opportunities to add value, especially in the U.S., where we're still in the pretty nascent stages of all this.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Schmidt : Hi, Ryan. Hi, Chris. Thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. I wanted to ask about value-add services growth. It's really good to see the consistency there. Maybe you could just talk about the predictability, and then maybe comment a little bit more on the planning process of how you sort of feed the engine and continue to drive that growth. I know there's an organic and inorganic components penetration aspects to this but if you could help unpack that. I know it's a lot of things in there but if you could help unpack that, it'd be great. Thanks so much.\nRyan McInerney : We, too, are very excited about the consistent growth we've been able to deliver year after year with the value-added services businesses. And we deliver that through planning, sales planning, client planning, product road mapping, all the things that you would expect we do business by business, in the issuer solutions business, the acquirer solutions business, risk and advisory business, and so on and so forth. When you think about the opportunity, here's how I would encourage you to think about it, which is the same way we kind of plan to go to market. We deliver value-added services for Visa transactions. And these are offerings that are built to enable Visa to be the best way to pay and be paid market by market around the world. And we're continuing to invest to add new functionality to improve the payment success and the security on the network. So these are products and services like Visa Account Updater, the risk products that we talk a lot about like Visa Secure, the dispute tools that we deliver like Visa Resolve Online, the benefits that we offer. So that's kind of 1 component of the opportunity. The second part of the opportunity is services for non-Visa transactions. This is an area you've heard me and us talking a lot more about in recent quarters. This includes acceptance services like CyberSource, Authorize.net, Verifi, risk tools like Decision Manager, processing solutions like DPS, like Pismo, and again, these are all capabilities that we're bringing to market for our clients that add value for all different types of payment transactions. And then the third set of opportunities that we're going after are services beyond payments. This is a much broader category. It includes things like our consulting and analytics teams, our marketing services teams, open banking services such as Tink, we were talking about earlier in terms of their data aggregation solutions. We're now offering core banking platform services as part of the Pismo acquisition as well. So that hopefully gives you a sense of how we look at the opportunities, we look at the competitive sets, we build and deliver products, we build and deliver our sales motions and go-to-market and ultimately deliver the consistent growth that you referenced.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Koning : Hey, guys. Thank you. On the cross-border line, revenue growth was stable at 9% this quarter, same as last quarter, but reported volumes accelerated 1%. And I would think FX volatility was less bad so that probably helped a little bit, and mix seemed about the same. So I was wondering, is there anything else, any other little headwinds emerging there? What -- maybe what created the gap?\nChris Suh : Yeah, sure. So a couple of things. So as you pointed out, international revenue grew slower than total cross-border volumes. It really did have to do with the volatility. So Q4 volatility did improve from Q3 a bit but it was lower than the volatility that we saw last year. And secondly, the associated volume, the cross-border volume, 13% in Q4, as expected, but also lower than the volume growth that we saw in Q4 a year ago. And so when you combine those things that had impacted the differential that you see between volumes and revenue.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Tim Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTim Chiodo : Great. Thank you for taking the question. So I wanted to dig into two specific aspects of value-added services, so first being DPS and the second being CyberSource. I believe those two combined make up a reasonably large portion of the transaction-based value-added services. I think the last disclosure on DPS was about $2.5 trillion in volume, and CyberSource is in the roughly $1 trillion. I was hoping you could give sort of relative growth rates relative to the rest of value-added services and maybe some updated stats if possible. Thanks.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah, thanks for the question. We're super proud about the progress that we're making in DPS and CyberSource, DPS being primarily in the U.S. and CyberSource being a really at-scale global platform now. But we don't provide transaction volume growth or break out other metrics at that level of reporting. So I appreciate the interest. Sorry not to be able to provide any more detail.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the pickup you've seen in October for volume growth, especially in debit. Looks like it's perked up a little bit to 7%. Anything you're seeing there in new wins or is that potentially a better economic environment driving that? And then just quickly, secondly, on the price to value, just the change in timing, what was the reason for the change? Why is the timing different this year?\nChris Suh : Sure. Okay, I'll start with your question about October and then I think Ryan will handle your second part of your question. So in terms of October, so as we've consistently said, three weeks don't make a trend. It was true in July when we started a little bit slower and then Q4 ended up being stable. And we think it's true now as we see a strong start to October. Now that said, here's a couple of things that we see in terms of relative strength between the month of October and how we ended Q4. Two things that I'd point to: one is days mix. So the growth in the month of September was lower due to days mix. Last year, September had an extra Friday and Saturday, which are two of the highest spend days of the week. And this September, that was replaced with a Sunday and Monday, which are two of the lower spend days. And so that had an impact on September growth. And then secondly, in the U.S., in addition to that days mix point, we are starting to lap the modest impact of Reg II that we started to talk about a year ago in Q1. And so those combined things are contributing to what we see as the start of October. But as we said, it's three weeks. Let's see how the quarter plays out.\nRyan McInerney : Bryan, yeah, as you noted and we've said many times, we price to value. So when we price to value, we have to ship products. We have to ship services. We have to deliver solutions that are adding value and increasing value to our clients. And our product pipeline in 2025 is a bit more backloaded, especially as we bring some new and exciting products and services to the market, and so that really drives the difference in pricing cadence in 2025.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg : Thanks, guys. Just looking at the U.S. card-present volume growth, I think we've been in the 2% range here for the past two or three quarters. So wondering if you're expecting that to accelerate in fiscal '25. And Chris, can you just quantify what that favorable adjustment to Q4 new flows revenues were? Thank you.\nChris Suh : Got it. Jason, you cut out a little bit at the end. What was the second part of your question, Jason?\nJason Kupferberg : That onetime helper to new flows revenue in Q4, if you could quantify that?\nChris Suh : Okay, got it. I'll start with the second one since you just asked it. Yeah, we feel great about the momentum of new flows. Q3 was 18%, now to 22% in Q4. As I said on the call though, Q4 was helped by this onetime rebate adjustment due to deal timing. So we had expected a client to earn a rebate, which was contingent on them achieving a milestone, and they didn't achieve it. So as such, we recorded a onetime adjustment to that rebate, which landed in Q4. And I think your first question was around card-present and just sort of volumes as we look forward into FY '25. And maybe that's why I'll go out, just broaden it a little bit and say, per our call, our overall assumptions on underlying drivers is that in '25, they remain relatively stable to the trends that we see, both for the full year on payment volume and payment transactions relative to '24 and then on cross-border to the trends that we see in Q4. And so they will remain relatively strong and healthy. And like I said, we'll continue to update you throughout the course of the year.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Craig Maurer from FT Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer : Hi, thanks everybody for taking my questions. I wanted to ask first, haven't asked in a long time about your thoughts on operating leverage, and you're growing expenses at a similar rate to revenue in the forecast for fiscal year '25. And going forward long term, is there a commitment to grow revenue faster than expenses or are we looking at limited operating leverage in the future? And secondly, considering the fiscal year '25 guide, what are your assumptions around APAC embedded in the guide? Do you need acceleration in China to achieve that or is it basically assuming the same steady no growth situation there? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney : I'll take the first question and you can take the second question, Chris. On your first question, as I said on this call and earlier calls, we have an enormous set of opportunities that we're pursuing. And the way we're running the business day in and day out, quarter in and quarter out, year in and year out is we're going through the assessment of those opportunities, we're figuring out the product pipeline that we can deploy. We're looking at inorganic and organic opportunities. And we're putting together a plan that we think maximizes the long-term growth that we can deliver. That's the way we approach it. That's the way we think about it. And you see the results that we've delivered, and you heard what Chris's comments were in the guide for this year. So that's kind of where we are with that.\nChris Suh : I'll address your comments on AP specifically. So again, at a global basis, we expect overall trends to be relatively similar to where we're ending FY '24. And the situation in AP, so much of that has been driven by the macroeconomic conditions in China. And as we've consistently said, we don't forecast the economy. And so again, in the context of relatively stable drivers, we'll see how AP performs but again, it will really be dependent on the health of the overall economy.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nTrevor Williams : Great, thanks a lot. Yeah, I wanted to follow up on value-added services. I think the general framework you've given is roughly two thirds of VAS revenue is transaction-linked in some form. Of that portion that's tied to transactions or volume, how much of that today needs to be running over VisaNet for you to be earning those vast revenue streams? Ryan, it sounds like most of it today is still running over your network but maybe the off-network piece should be increasing as a percentage of the mix over time. But anything more specific there would be helpful. Thanks.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah. I mean, the largest component of our VAS revenue today is that first bucket of services I mentioned for Visa transactions, and obviously, we've been doing that the longest time. And just to comment on that, what that really does is it drives additional yield on top of our Visa transactions. So we're adding more value to the transaction. We're adding more value to the clients and ultimately driving additional yield on top of the Visa payments volume growth that we see. But as I said, we also see -- we've made meaningful progress building out our platforms to service non-Visa transactions. CyberSource I mentioned, Verifi I mentioned, Pismo I mentioned, Decision Manager I mentioned. These are all becoming meaningful platforms for us with meaningful opportunity. And you can just imagine the TAM that we're able to go after when we're not just delivering services for Visa transactions but we're able to work with clients to deliver services on top of a much broader array of payment transactions is just significant. So we remain very excited about both.\nJennifer Como: Last question, please.\nOperator: Our final question goes to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller : Hey, thanks, guys. Look, just coming off of the, I think it was 12% growth in incentives and rebates in '24, and now you're saying obviously higher in '25. It's obviously great to see the activities [indiscernible] growth. Maybe just help us understand a little more around, you mentioned a lot of renewals but what about just net new business and market share gains. How does that build in? And I guess related to that, looks like this year is a big year of that constant revenue growth rate. So does that have an impact on how you think about this year's growth versus long term? We think it could be actually even better this year being a little bit of an outlying year in terms of growth in incentives and rebates, if we're thinking about that correctly. Thanks, guys.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah, Darrin, I mean, I don't think we're going to get into like the outer years but I'd say a couple of things. One is we're winning, like we're winning region by region and market by market around the world. You look at the size and sophistication of some of those names that I mentioned in my prepared remarks and I've mentioned for the last couple of quarters. We are winning and we feel really good about that market by market around the world. Second thing is, as we've also talked about in the past, we can't necessarily predict the time of when these renewals are going to happen, when a competitive situation is going to happen to our client. We have to be ready at any given time to give our best and hopefully, ultimately win. And as you were alluding to, there's been kind of a string of those recently and more of them this quarter that we're excited about. So we'll continue to deploy a great product. We'll continue to -- we've got a great team that I acknowledged during the prepared remarks that's serving these clients, which is ultimately a big reason they choose to both continue to do business with us and expand the business that they're doing with us, expand the consumer business, expand in the commercial business, expand into new flows, and we feel really good about it.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, all, for participating in Visa's fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and please enjoy the rest of your day."}, {"symbol": "V", "quarter": 3, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-07-23 20:29:07", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Visa's Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\nJennifer Como: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. Our comments today regarding our financial results will reflect revenue on a GAAP basis and all other results on a non-GAAP nominal basis unless otherwise noted. The related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release and related materials available on our IR website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered strong third quarter results with $8.9 billion in net revenue, up 10% year-over-year, and EPS up 12%. Our key business drivers were relatively stable as compared to Q2, adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 7% year-over-year, U.S. payments volume grew 5%, and international payments volume grew 10%. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, rose 14%, and processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. We recently received the results from our annual Global Client Engagement Survey where Visa achieved a Global Net Promoter Score, or NPS, of 76, up three points from last year. We saw NPS increases across all of our client types, merchants, issuers, fintechs, and processors and across our regions, the results remain strong, with a notable 6-point NPS improvement in North America. I want to thank all of our 30,000 employees who helped deliver these fantastic results. And as I review some highlights from the quarter, you'll see how this focus on serving our clients by meeting their needs, innovating, and helping them grow is fueling our success across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Let's start with consumer payments, where we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity to capture cash, check, ACH, domestic schemes and other forms of electronic payment. In our client engagement survey, our clients ranked our strategic partnership and our brand as two of the most important factors to our successful relationships. I'll share some examples of how each of these played out this quarter. In strategic partnerships, we are constantly seeking ways to add more value and grow together with our clients. We are pleased to have been named the Preferred Network Partner by Lloyds Banking Group, renewing our debit relationship and significantly expanding our relationship in credit, winning 10 million additional credit credentials across the Group's consumer and commercial business. Also in the U.K., NatWest has launched a new Visa Travel Reward credit card, following the signing of our partnership last year. They will also be utilizing many value-added services, including transaction controls and card benefits. On the European continent, we worked with Raiffeisen Bank International AG, a leading bank in several markets. And recently, in the Czech Republic and Romania, we renewed our commercial business and expanded our consumer debit and credit business totaling over two million potential new credentials. In Korea, we deepened our partnership with leading issuer KB Kookmin Card. Already a user of Visa Direct cross-border money movement and a Visa consumer and commercial issuer, they will grow their consumer credit and debit portfolios with Visa and use value-added services, including consulting and marketing services. In Peru, we extended our partnership with leading issuer, Banco de Credito de Peru, across consumer and commercial portfolios with plans to launch additional new flows offerings and value-added services. In the U.S., we extended our agreement with Wells Fargo. This will allow us to continue to support Wells Fargo's strategy to reinvent their credit business and provide additional growth by leveraging key Visa assets like consulting and Visa sponsorships such as FIFA and the Olympic and Paralympic Games. On the brand front, with the Olympic Games opening ceremony later this week, it is exciting to see the engagement with the Visa brand and activation across the world in marketing campaigns, cardholder experiences and Olympic and Paralympic-branded Visa issuance, which I am happy to report in Europe is at nearly six million cards compared to the five million number I quoted just last quarter. We have also added nearly 100,000 new merchant locations in France in advance of the event. Our brand also plays an important role in winning co-brand partnerships. In India, growing credit issuance and reaching affluent and cross-border consumers remain areas of focus. We are excited about the launch of a co-brand card with Adani One and ICICI Bank as India's first co-branded credit card with rich airport-linked benefits for their target base of 400 million customers through the Adani One platform. We also signed an agreement to launch a new co-brand card with Tata Digital, along with an Indian banking partner, building on the success of our existing credit co-brand relationship. This new co-brand offering consists of a multicurrency prepaid foreign exchange card that will target travelers from India, also benefiting from the rewards of the Tata Digital Super App, Tata Neu. Across seven countries in Latin America, we will work with Unicomer, a major retailer and financial services provider with numerous brands to deliver a co-brand credit card in addition to using CyberSource. And in CEMEA, we reached a de novo co-brand arrangement with BinDawood, a leading grocer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with 88 outlets and over five million loyalty program members. On the travel side, we extended our relationship with Malaysia Airlines from a prepaid co-brand card targeting millennials and Gen Z customers to also launch a new co-brand credit card for the travel-minded affluent. And in the U.S., Turkish Airlines have chosen Visa to be their exclusive network partner for their new Miles and Smiles co-brand credit card. Our consumer payment strategy is focused on growing credentials as we are doing across all the partnerships I just mentioned and increasing acceptance locations. And wallets are a great example of where this comes together, where Visa can be a funding source, an embedded credential, and an accepted form of payment by wallet merchants. This increases the value proposition for wallet providers and their users. Two wallet highlights this quarter are in Peru and Vietnam. Yape is a Peruvian super app with more than 15 million users who already have a Visa credential that enables them to send money across P2P apps via Visa Direct. And just recently, they launched Tap to Phone functionality for their more than two million merchants to accept Visa. And in Vietnam, a country with approximately 50 million wallet users, the three leading digital wallets, MoMo, VNPAY, and ZaloPay are now enabling their users to utilize Visa cards as a funding source for transactions at over 500,000 QR acceptance points managed by these wallets. One additional area that we are very focused on is delivering simple, easy, and secure checkout experiences. Let me share a few recent examples. First, we are integrating Click to Pay and the Visa Payment Passkey Service, enabling a customer to authenticate themselves using biometrics. Already, we have hundreds of issuers enabled for passkeys in Europe and a number of issuers who represent more than 50% of our e-commerce payments volume in Europe piloting the solution. Second, we crossed 10 billion tokens this quarter, a significant milestone. And in 2023 alone, Visa tokens helped generate more than an estimated $40 billion in incremental e-commerce revenue for businesses globally and saved more than $600 million in fraud. Third is the ability to tap for more use cases on a mobile device. With tapping as one of the best in-person commerce experiences, we want to provide Visa users with more ways to tap, including Tap to Pay, tap to authenticate an identity, tap to add a card, or tap to send money to family or friends. And finally, this quarter, Tap to Pay grew four percentage points from last year to 80% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the U.S. In the U.S., we surpassed 50% and have 30 U.S. cities above 60% penetration. Now moving on to new flows. This quarter, new flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars with Visa Direct overall transactions growing 41% for the quarter to 2.6 billion and commercial volumes up 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. Let me provide some updates, starting with B2B, where we have focused on penetrating new verticals and delivering innovative products and solutions. In healthcare, we will work with AXA and Paysure to launch a commercial virtual card solution to simplify the claims processes for their customers worldwide. We have also expanded our virtual card acceptance with a key business services provider, Cintas, who offers uniform, safety, and fire protection services to over one million customers. Together with our partner, Billtrust, we will help Cintas streamline their payments, automate processes, and manage costs on Billtrust's Business Payments Network or BPN. We also just recently extended our long-standing BPN collaboration with Billtrust that connects suppliers and buyers to facilitate straight-through processing of virtual card payments with rich data that optimizes acceptance costs. Our products and solutions in B2B remain very important in winning and growing our business. One such solution is the enhanced B2B data that we can provide. In Brazil, together with Solero, a leading business financial management solution, we will provide issuers with enhanced visibility into small business spend by aggregating data across cards, bank accounts, boletos and more, enabling them to better manage their client relationships and offer compelling products. Another solution is Spend Clarity, which provides expense program management, including card issuance, controls, and reporting. Wells Fargo has white-labeled our solution called Wells One Expense Manager, which has now onboarded 6,000 corporate clients representing over one million users, providing access to their spend data. Now moving on to Visa Direct. We continued to grow our transactions through expanded and new relationships. Over the past year, total Visa Direct cross-border P2P transactions have nearly doubled, with Europe and CEMEA being the largest regions. In CEMEA, we are very excited to have renewed our Visa Direct relationship with fintech Monobank in addition to renewing their consumer and commercial credit, debit, and prepaid portfolios. In Asia Pacific, we are partnering with China Zhongsheng Bank on cross-border capabilities, including Visa Direct and Currencycloud, allowing the bank to support cross-border payments for their merchant clients. Canadian fintech Nuvei has extended its agreement with us for Visa Direct across all cross-border use cases in more than 30 countries for their merchant clients and recently became the first Visa Direct enabler in Colombia. We also executed our first global agreement with WorldRemit and Sendwave, enabling their customers to eventually send Visa Direct cross-border remittances from 50 countries to recipients in 130 countries. Quickly, a leading South Asian marketplace, has enabled Visa Direct cross-border remittance solutions for U.S. customers to send money to relatives and friends in India and the rest of South Asia. And in earned wage access, we reached an agreement with Weaver, a U.K.-based embedded finance provider. In addition to card issuance, they will be utilizing Visa Direct to enable Weaver's business clients to offer employee expense reimbursement, reward and recognition, and earned wage access. Earned wage access provider PayActiv, who serves 4,000 businesses has renewed its agreement with us and will enable Visa+ for payouts. Similarly, we expanded our relationship with enabler, Astra. In addition to domestic disbursements, Astra will now offer cross-border remittances, implement Visa+ to reach domestic wallets in the U.S., and expand to additional use cases, including payroll, earned wage access and marketplaces. Visa+ is still in the early stages but is fully rolled out and live for PayPal and Venmo users and more providers continue to join the platform. Wrapping up new flows, we also renewed an agreement with FIS, an important issuer processing partner to enable a suite of value-added services and new flows capabilities for their clients, including Visa Direct. And now on to value-added services, where revenue was up 23% in the third quarter in constant dollars. Let me highlight some of the progress we have made in driving adoption and growth among our value-added services portfolio. First in issuing solutions. One area of strong revenue growth this quarter was in card benefits, where we enable our clients to offer unique value propositions tailored to their customer base in travel, entertainment, restaurants, insurance and more. Strong issuance in premium cards across most of our regions has fueled this growth in the third quarter. For example, in Latin America, travel benefits have grown with over 370,000 unique visits to our Visa Infinite Airport Lounge in Brazil, representing customers from a number of leading issuers. In addition, since its launch in 2022, our Visa Infinite Fast Pass in Brazil, which allows cardholders to get through airport security more quickly, has screened over one million travelers. These are among the top five card benefits in Brazil and deliver value to customers, issuers and Visa. We continue to add more benefits like the recently launched partnership with OpenTable to offer eligible Visa cardholders access to coveted restaurant reservations and experiences in the U.S., with plans to expand into Canada and Mexico. In Acceptance Solutions, third quarter growth was driven by increasing utilization across both token and e-commerce-related services. In e-commerce, one such example is with iFood, the largest food delivery platform in Brazil who is utilizing our Verifi solution to help prevent disputes before they become chargebacks. In addition, they will be using our authentication solutions. In Risk & Identity Solutions, we continued to see strong adoption by new and existing clients, driven in part by growth in card-not-present transactions. In North America, acquirer Worldpay will be expanding their use of our authentication solutions from CardinalCommerce, fostering collaboration and real-time enhanced data exchange between Worldpay merchants and issuers during card-not-present transactions, reducing fraud and allowing more transactions to be properly authenticated and authorized securely. We are also pleased that the pilot of our account-to-account risk scoring solution Visa Protect with Pay.UK has had great results, showing an average 40% uplift in fraud detection over the 3-month pilot period. In addition, we are now launching Visa Protect in Argentina with a core payments technology company, Celsa after successfully piloting the solution there as well. The last two value-added services are open banking and advisory services. We continue to sign new partners with Tink in Europe and the U.S. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong growth in client demand for our consulting and marketing services, particularly around marquee events such as the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Our value-added services portfolio solutions is strong and is driving meaningful growth for our clients and for Visa. Before I close, I wanted to speak to the fact that the settlement reached for the injunctive relief class was rejected by the court. We are, of course, disappointed with this decision. We believe that the prior settlement provided meaningful relief to all merchants and we will continue to work towards another settlement. To close, so far this fiscal year, we have seen strong revenue and EPS growth as a result of relatively stable volume and transaction growth. I remain very excited about the opportunity that lies ahead of us. At Visa, we come to work in service of our clients and partners and are focused on building and deploying the best solutions possible across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Now over to Chris.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we had another strong quarter with relatively stable growth across payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions when compared to Q2, adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year and cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, was up 14% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Fiscal third quarter net revenue was up 10% in both GAAP and constant dollars, in line with our expectations. EPS was up 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant dollars. Now let's go into the details. In the U.S., payment volumes growth numbers were generally in line with Q2 adjusted for leap year, with total Q3 payments volume growing 5% year-over-year, with credit and debit also growing 5%. Card-present volume grew 2% and card-not-present volume grew 7%. In the U.S., while growth in the high spend consumer segment remained stable compared to prior quarters, we saw a slight moderation in the lower spend consumer segment. Moving to international markets. Total payments volume was up 10% in constant dollars, relatively stable with Q2 when adjusted for leap year. Payments volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions, with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe ex U.K. each growing more than 16% in constant dollars. Asia Pacific payments volume slowed to less than 0.5 point of year-over-year growth in constant dollars for the quarter, driven primarily by the macroeconomic environment, most notably in Mainland China. Now to cross-border volume, which I will speak to today in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 14% in Q3, relatively stable to Q2 adjusted for leap year. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, was in the mid-teens, helped by continued strength in retail. Cross-border travel volume growth was also up in the mid-teens or 157% indexed to 2019. This quarter, we saw the inbound Asia Pacific Index improve nine points at a similar pace to Q2 to 151% of 2019. The improvement in Asia Pacific outbound travel, however, slowed from Q2 with the index increasing by less than one point to 125% of 2019. We continue to see the same primary drivers as last quarter with some additional pressure from macroeconomic conditions. Now let's review our third quarter financial results. I'll start with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 8% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q2 constant dollar payments volume, with revenue yield improving sequentially and versus last year due to improving utilization of card benefit. Data processing revenue grew 9% versus 10% processed transaction growth with the revenue yield generally in line sequentially and versus last year. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 14% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping higher currency volatility from last year. Volatility levels remain consistent on average to last quarter. Other revenue grew 31%, primarily driven by strong consulting and marketing services revenue related to the Olympics and, to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 11%. Now on to our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transaction growth. New flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions grew 41% year-over-year, helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Commercial volumes rose 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Q3, value-added services revenue grew 23% in constant dollars to $2.2 billion, primarily driven by Issuing and Acceptance Solutions and Advisory Services. Operating expenses grew 14%, primarily due to increases in general and administrative personnel and marketing expenses, including spend related to the Olympics. FX was 0.5 point drag versus the 1.5 point benefit we expected. Pismo represented an approximately one point drag. Nonoperating income was $73 million. Our tax rate was 18.8% and EPS was $2.42, up 12% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 1.5 point drag from exchange rates and an approximately 0.5 point drag from Pismo. In Q3, we bought back approximately $4.8 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of June, we had $18.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in July through the 21st with volume growth in constant dollars. Cross-border is excluding intra-Europe. U.S. payments volume was up 4% with debit up 4% and credit up 3% year-over-year. The slight deceleration from Q3 does not appear to be from any one factor but likely a number of smaller factors such as weather, timing of promotional shopping events, and the technology outage, among others. Cross-border volume grew 13% year-over-year, below Q3 levels with travel-related volume growing slightly less, which continued to be impacted by Asia Pacific and card-not-present ex travel volume growing at similar levels to Q3. Processed transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excludes acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. Let's start with the fourth quarter. We expect payments volume and processed transactions to grow at a similar rate to Q3. For total cross-border volume growth, we are expecting to end up slightly below Q3. Currency volatility continues to average around 4-year lows through July 21. And as such, we are making an adjustment to currency volatility expectations for Q4, now assuming volatility will stay in line with Q3 levels. Incentives are expected to be at their lowest growth rate all year. Pulling it all together, we expect adjusted net revenue growth in the low double digits, which equates to a slight improvement from the 10% adjusted revenue growth rate in the third quarter. We expect our Q4 adjusted operating expenses to grow in the high single digits. Nonoperating income is expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 19% and 19.5% in Q4, which puts Q4 adjusted EPS growth rate in the high end of low double digits. Moving to the full year. With three quarters now complete, our expectations for full year adjusted net revenue growth remains unchanged from what we shared at the start of the year. Whilst absorbing the impact of lower currency volatility and the macroeconomic challenges in Asia, which have affected volumes, we still expect to reach low double-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the full year. Full year adjusted operating expense growth will be in the high single digit to low double digits, reflecting the less favorable impact of FX. This keeps full year adjusted EPS growth in the low teens. In closing, we delivered strong results this quarter, with new flows and value added services revenue growing faster than consumer payments. We extended our existing relationships, one new clients and invested to develop innovative products and solutions, all positioning us for continued growth into the future. But now Jennifer, it's time for some Q&A.\nJennifer Como: Thanks Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Hi, thanks guys. Look, let me just start. The U.S. volume growth rate obviously is a bit softer. And if you could help us distill what you consider structural versus cyclical, I think that'd be a good place to start. But adding on to it really is, just the ability for you to grow double-digit revenue with only four, five, six, mid-single-digit U.S. volume growth is, coming from value added services. It's coming from cross border. Can you help us understand if that kind of trend, you believe the company has that capability to grow those rates on revenues, even in this context of U.S. volume trends? Thanks guys.\nChris Suh: Yes. Hi Darrin. So let me start with the U.S. Let me start with the first part of your question, and then we'll maybe get into zoom out and talk about maybe the longer question. So in the U.S. in Q3, we did see stable drivers relative to Q2, once you adjust for leap year. That's 5% payment volumes growth in the third quarter. In the 21 days since in July, that number did tick down to 4%. Maybe I'll just sort of give you the full arc of what we're seeing. So 4%, we'll just level set on those numbers, 4% in the 21 days versus 5% in Q3. And so for that, we did stare at a lot of the drivers, the factors that impacted those three weeks. And there was a lot going on and I referenced a few of them on the call and maybe I'll expand on those a bit. First, we had a major hurricane, Hurricane Beryl, and it impacted Texas and other parts of the U.S. nearby. The second, I referenced the timing of promotional e-commerce events. Maybe I can expand on that a little bit. The timing this year was later and then e-commerce customers are billed, when the goods are shipped. And so, some of that shipping periods fell out of that 21 period. So we had a little bit of difference in the 21 day period, to the comparable year ago. And third, obviously the major tech outage that happened at the end of last week, that also had some impact. So, when we look at that, no single factor drove that one point of change from Q3, to the first part of July. But all things considered, we actually feel pretty good about the three week results. Now the second part of your question really was around sort of the low double-digits in the context of cross-border, VAS and CMS. I'll sort of back into the question. We've had consistent strong performance in VAS, over $2 billion of revenue, over 20% growth for many quarters consecutively. And we're seeing strength across the business in issuing solutions and acceptance and advisory. That's a business that we feel great about the momentum in. With our new flows business, 18% growth, as Ryan talked about, in the quarter, that's the second quarter in a row, where we're seeing growth in the teens, great execution, stable volumes, and visa direct transactions growing at a high level. As you know, that business also, quarter-to-quarter, can vary a little bit in the growth rates, as we saw in the first half of the year. But all in all, feel really good about the continued strength in that business. And then cross-border, well, cross-border, maybe I'll just zoom out a little bit and talk about cross-border and what we've seen over the course of time. If you recall, pre-pandemic, cross-border grew, travel grew in the high single-digits to low double-digits. And e-commerce, which was about a third of the business, grew into the teens, sometimes into the mid-teens. Obviously, the pandemic happened, travel really contracted, e-commerce grew faster. And since then, now post-pandemic, what we're seeing now is that e-commerce is roughly 40% of the business. And the growth rate has normalized. It's stabilized back to pre-pandemic levels. And so let's say, teens growth on e-commerce on 40% of the cross-border business. Travel after the post-pandemic run-up has normalized. It's a little hard to tell exactly where it's going to stabilize at, but we've seen high growth. We've seen it continue to normalize. But what we do know structurally, is that with e-commerce being a bigger portion of the business, that's a tail into the total cross-border growth. And so, we are confident that that will continue to be healthy relative to the domestic spend. I'll pause there and certainly if there's anything else to add, Ryan, or others, please jump in.\nRyan McInerney: No, nothing to add from me, Chris. Thanks, Darrin.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Jeffrey from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. Very impressive value-added services growth this quarter at 23%. And I think as you mentioned, Chris, it's approaching 25% of total revenue, so perhaps driving more than half your consolidated revenue growth. Can you talk a little bit about at what point we might expect value-added services to sort of bend up the growth curve of Visa consolidated?\nRyan McInerney: It's Ryan, Andrew. Thanks for the question. And yes, we're very excited about not only what we delivered, in terms of value-added services growth for the quarter. What we've been delivering consistently for several years now, since we shared with you all the strategy, and kind of became very purposeful about our go-to-market approach. I mean, you go back to I think it was 2021, we did about $5 billion in revenue, 2022, $6 billion. Last year was $7 billion. Like you said, we did $2.2 billion this quarter, up 23%. So I think what we've shown, is that we have delivered consistent growth quarter-after-quarter, and year-after-year in these businesses. And we're super optimistic about where we go from here. I mean, we think about the opportunities really in three different segments. The first is, we have a series of value-added services, some of which Chris outlined in his previous answer that, are very focused on enhancing value for Visa transactions. Risk products like Visa Secure, dispute tools like Visa Resolve Online, card benefits, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we've - that has historically been the largest part of our value-added services business. And we've shown that we can drive great growth in that area. Increasingly, we're building out a set of services that add value for non-Visa transactions. We've done some things in this space before. Some of our platforms like CyberSource, Authorize.Net, Verifi. But then you've heard me talk in the last couple of quarters about expanding our risk capabilities. For example, to not just other card networks, but also to RFCP and account-to-account services. And I mentioned the great results we've had in both the U.K. and in Argentina on that front. And then the third area of opportunity for us, is expanding our value-added services beyond payments. Historically, we've had things like Visa Consulting and Analytics and our marketing services And some of the open banking services delivered by Tink, but we're continuing to build out a portfolio of value-added services, for our clients and partners beyond payments things like the cyber protection capabilities that we've been bringing to market. So, we've demonstrated consistent growth. We believe we'll be able to continue to demonstrate consistent growth. We've got a product pipeline, and a go-to-market approach all over the world with a diverse set of clients, and we feel good about the opportunity.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys, good afternoon. Chris, just want to ask about incentives, being the lowest expectation will be for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about how much of that is volume-driven, versus the amount of renewals you're seeing? And just trying to think about, as we head into next fiscal year, just what kind of growth or sustainable growth should we think about for incentives? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Thanks for the question. I'll even take us back a little bit about the expectations that, we had for incentives coming into the fiscal year. As we ended fiscal '23, that was a high year for us in terms of volume of renewals, a little higher than our typical sort of normal cadence. That did impact how we thought about the incentive volumes in FY '24. And even last year, we had sort of a different growth rate in the first half and the second half of the year. And so as we looked across this year, we had a slightly lower volume of renewals this year. Obviously, year-to-date incentives have played out slightly differently, largely due to client performance, deal timing, things like that. And overall, it's been better than, as it's been lower, I guess, than what we anticipated. When we go into Q4, sort of the same trend applies. We still expect Q4 to benefit from the lapping of the high incentives that, we saw in the second half of last year, which informs, again, the growth rate that we anticipate in Q4. We don't have a lot to share about FY 2025 at this point, but we'll share plenty in the next earnings call.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Suchoski from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nKen Suchoski: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about VAS and I think the team has talked about, how some of the VAS revenue is correlated with transaction growth. But you also have parts of that business that are more recurring, or less recurring in nature. So can you just help us understand how, you think about the cyclicality of VAS, and how that business might perform in a lower volume growth environment? And I also think the team has talked about pricing, for value in VAS. So how much more room is left to go there? And how does that help with the resiliency of the business? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yes Ken, it's Ryan. On the second part of your question, our ability to price for value is a function of the value that we bring to the market, and we feel great about the value that we're bringing to the market. And I think you see it in our results. Across the various different areas of issuing solutions, Acceptance Solutions, Risk & Identity Solutions, Advisory. I mean, we just continue to bring products and services that are ultimately, helping our clients grow their business, helping our clients reduce fraud, grow authorizations, those types of things. And we believe we'll continue to do that, and we believe we'll be able to continue to price for value. As I think I was saying earlier, there is - the biggest portion of our value-added services, are a function of Visa transactions. And so obviously, Visa transactions, as they go up or down, have an impact on that, but so does our ability to sell more services. On previous calls, I've talked about the fact that we still have the majority of our clients that have yet to have the type of penetration and depth that, we've been able to achieve with others. So, as we continue to penetrate our clients, all around the world in the various markets that we deliver, as I was saying earlier, to the earlier question, I'm very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow this business as we have.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Just curious if you're - if you've updated your U.S. outlook here in the second half, are you still expecting transaction sizes to accelerate in the U.S., especially in the fourth quarter?\nChris Suh: Hi, Tien-Tsin. Thanks for the question. Yes, we had forecasted ATS, as you know, growth to improve throughout the pace of this year from quarter-to-quarter, and we did see that. We saw ATS improve in the third quarter. Specifically in the U.S., ATS was slightly better in Q3 than in Q2. It got to basically flat year-over-year in Q3. We saw improvement in a number of categories, sequentially, restaurant, QSR fuel, telecom, utilities, insurance, to name a few. And we do anticipate in Q4 that we'll continue to see, slight improvement sequentially again. The one thing - the one watch out I'll call out is the fuel prices could impact that trajectory and so, we'll watch that closely. So yes, it is playing out as we anticipated. The pace is slightly varied from what we anticipated, but it is continuing to improve. And I think that's the important thing.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gus Gala from Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Please go ahead.\nGus Gala: Hi, guys. Thank you. Can we talk a little bit about the contactless payments penetration? Can you maybe highlight maybe what the gap is in penetration rates, across maybe some of your older cardholders or young cardholders? Just trying to get around to what a terminal level of penetration could look like? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: You're asking - just so I heard, you're asking about Tap to Pay?\nGus Gala: Yes.\nRyan McInerney: I mean, yes, maybe just back up first in the big picture of things. The fact that outside of the United States, eight out of 10 of all the Visa face-to-face transactions around the entire planet are Tap to Pay now, I mean, that just tells you right there that it's all segments, all demographics, all use cases, all product types. I mean, we're at 80% overall around the world. We've got, I think, more than 55 countries that are now more than 90% contactless penetration. So increasingly, in most countries for most customers, for most products all around the world, that's just the default way that people are paying. And in the U.S., the curve is maturing exactly how we'd expect it based on what we've seen in 100-plus countries all around the world. As I said in my prepared remarks, now one out of every two transactions in the U.S. are taps. In a place like New York City, where many of you on the call spend time, we're above 75% now. So in New York City, where - which is one of the early adopters of transit, we're above, I think, 75%-plus of all face-to-face transactions. That's up from just 50% two years ago. So again, at that level of penetration in a market the size of New York City, it's across the board in terms of products and issuers, and segments and the like. So, I think as we continue to see this growth happen, buyers, sellers, they love tapping as a way to pay. And we're going to continue to see that growth accelerate in a place like the U.S.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nWill Nance: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. We've been getting a lot of questions around the litigation updates, and I totally understand the level of uncertainty is a lot higher now. But I guess the most common investor question that we're getting is, around the potential impacts to the overall ecosystem, if we see a much greater reduction in interchange rates from what was proposed. And I guess specifically how the production and interchange rates, could reverberate through renewal negotiations with issuers, and then longer term, how this may impact the trajectory of incentives and net yields. So just wondering if we could hear kind of your perspective, about the potential reduction, or a larger reduction in the overall size of sort of ecosystem revenue, and if that changes the direction of any of the key indicators that we're focused on over time? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Hi, Will. Thanks for the question. And you're asking about the MDL litigation. I guess I'll just back up. The first thing I would say is we strongly disagree with the judge's decision. We believe the settlement was fair. We believe the settlement provided meaningful relief to all merchants. The second thing, I would say is the decision failed to take into consideration a number of things, especially the complex multisided ecosystem that we operate in. The role that - the complicated role that many different players in the ecosystem delivered. So, but having said that, we're pursuing a revised settlement. It's too early to speculate on what that settlement is. So I just - I won't do that today. But I would ask everybody to keep in mind, a settlement can occur at any point before, during, or even after the trial. So just keep that in mind as the process plays out.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I want to hit on that at the same time tackles, both incentives and value-added services revenue. So it's the concept of value in-kind incentives. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether or not, these are becoming more prominent, meaning you're using them a little bit more in discussions with issuers. And then, if you could just briefly recap some of the mechanics around the revenue recognition, the contra revenue, the addition to deferred revenue. And then eventually, the value-added services revenue? Thanks a lot.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. I'll just give you the high level on this. The value in-kind is a great way for us to, as it says, to deliver value to our clients. And increasingly, our clients, as you see in our performance are preferring to buy our value-added services, versus just take incentives that might drop to the bottom line. So that is absolutely something that, our clients are asking for more of. It's something that is helping our clients grow their businesses. And I talked earlier about just the last several years about our product pipeline, how we've gone to market, how we built new products to solutions and services for our clients. And that's what's driving the demand. So that's kind of become a more important part of our client renewals and our client renewal discussions. And increasingly value-added services are becoming a way for us to differentiate ourselves with our clients, and grow our consumer payments business. Do you want to talk about the organics?\nChris Suh: Tim, to the second part of your question, maybe I'll just give you a high-level summary. I think you have sort of the pieces you called out. At a high level, when value in-kind is offered in lieu of a cash incentive, it can - it would be recognized as a contra revenue at the time that it's granted or earned, depending on the nature of the contract. And then on the other side, when the client is able to utilize that value in-kind for services from Visa, commonly in our value-added services business, that's then recognized as revenue and the associated costs are also recognized in our P&L.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to just ask a follow-up question on near-term trends. We've seen a little bit of further slowing in credit than in debit over the last couple of months, and in the past has been a little bit of an indication of consumer stress. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that. And it seems like you're looking for the rest of the September quarter that, there's a little bit of a re-acceleration, as we get past some of the issues that you identified in July. Just want to make sure that I'm understanding that correctly, and kind of how we should interpret a little bit of the divergence in credit and debit growth right now? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Let me just give a little context on it and then Chris, feel free to add or correct. Like Chris said, we're three weeks into the quarter. We had a hurricane. We had a tech outage across the country. We had a number of things happen. So, we're not kind of taking three weeks as a trend. We'll see kind of how things progress from here, in just terms kind of what happens for the rest of the quarter. I don't know if you want to talk about the credit-debit divergence.\nChris Suh: Yes. Well, I think I'll refer back to a little bit of a comment that we made, and we're seeing the July results. I also commented on the call that we are seeing a little bit of moderation in what I would call the lower spend band cohorts. And I think that's a little bit correlated, to some of the volume numbers that we're seeing in the quarter, related to credit versus debit. But all in all, when we look at it relative to, again, Q2 and Q3, we see it to be relatively stable once you factor in sort of the days mix with the leap year.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Wanted to ask on new flows here. So you had a nice acceleration in growth really over the last two quarters on consistent comps. Can you add more color on the particular areas of strength that have picked up? I know Visa Direct was one of those. I'm just curious if you think you could sustain that level of expansion, or may that moderate a bit?\nChris Suh: Yes. Thanks for the question. 18% growth, as I mentioned, feel really good about the execution and the momentum in the business. It is an enormous opportunity that we have in front of us, across both our commercial business and money movement with Visa Direct. I think you're familiar with the numbers, 41% growth in the transactions and stable commercial volumes as well. I think what - this acceleration that you're referring to, we had a unique situation in Q1 where we had some onetime items that really kind of depressed the growth, reported growth in Q1. And if you look at the last couple of quarters, it's more reflective, I think, of the underlying health in the business. That said, as we saw in Q1, that growth rate can vary from quarter-to-quarter, based on deal timing and terms and one-time items like the one that impacted Q1. And so overall, I'd say at the macro level, good momentum. The underlying business is healthy, and we're continuing to see that level of growth. And the growth rate should be healthier, and should continue to grow faster than consumer payments, with some normal expected variability quarter-to-quarter.\nRyan McInerney: And just to build on Chris' points, I think we're in the very early stages of Visa Direct growth. We spent many, many years investing and building the platform, the infrastructure, the connectivity, domestic cross-border, working with issuers and acquirers and processors. And now we're able to be out there selling all around the world, finding new use cases, some of which I highlighted in my prepared remarks. You go back to 2019, we did 2 billion Visa Direct transactions. We did 2.6 billion transactions this quarter. So this is just another great example of, when we go and we systematically identify the need in the market, we spend the time, we build the infrastructure. We build 8.5 billion end points, the connectivity, the reliability, the security, the fraud capabilities. I just think we're in the very early stages of what we're going to see, in terms of the growth of this business and the number of use cases and partners, many of which I highlighted in my prepared remarks that, are going to want to build their use cases on this platform.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. I guess most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just on that last point, Ryan, you were making, I'm just wondering, where are we in the evolution of yield there? Can those go higher as you continue to expand in some of those categories with Visa Direct? And then just in terms of Reg II, is the full impact of Reg II now in the run rate, or should we expect there be any uncertainties related to that? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. I'll take both of them. On the first one, we're still in the early evolution of the use cases. I mean, we weren't even talking about earned wage access a couple of years ago, Sanjay. And so as we've got - I think we've got 65 or so use cases now on the platform, our teams are finding new use cases all the time. So I think we're continuing to see the evolution of all of that and the economics of all that will play out. What I would point you back to, is what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the tremendous success we're having in cross-border. We've had great success in selling new use cases, and driving cross-border transaction growth in Visa Direct. As you know, the yields are higher in cross-border, given the value that we add. So again, feel good about all of that. Listen, I want to just emphasize in terms of Reg II, the e-commerce debit market is a very competitive market, and is going to be competitive for as far as we can see. So while Chris noted, I think noted that the impact has remained the same, we haven't seen any change in impact, and I don't - and we're not expecting any change in impact for the fourth quarter. It is a competitive business. We are out there with clients day in and day out, helping them understand the benefits of processing transactions on Visa. And there are a lot of them, which is why we feel good so far in the evolution of Reg II, about how we've been able to grow that business. We feel great about the capabilities that a Visa data transaction offers, many of which I've talked about on these calls in the past. So we're out there, we're competing, we're selling, we're delivering our products, and we feel good about our win rate.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks guys. So just a clarification on revenue, and then a question on volumes for this fiscal year. So it sounds like for Q4, you're looking for revenue growth of, call it, 11% to 12%. I think that would put you at the low end of the low double-digit guide, you're maintaining for the year. So that's what I wanted to clarify. And then just a question on volumes. I think you said Q4 should be in line with Q3, which I think would bring the full year to around 7%, versus the high single-digit updated guide last quarter. So just as we start to tune our models for next year, what are some of the potential accelerants off that 7% level we should be considering?\nChris Suh: Hi, Jason, let's unpack that. You had a couple of things in there, and I just want to - I think this is important, so we'll just be super clear. For Q4, my guidance, our guidance for our Q4 adjusted net revenue would be low double-digits. And sort of the directional guidance I also gave is it would be slightly above the Q3 level that we reported, which was the 10% growth in the quarter. And so sort of take that - take those two points and I would triangulate around that. And that would still get you sort of to the math of the low end of low double-digits, as you called it, for the full year. The second point was on drivers from Q3 to Q4. I did say that payment volume, payment transactions, we anticipate Q4 to be consistent with Q3. The one exception to that is in cross-border, where I did say it'd be slightly below the Q3 levels. And that really is based on the travel circumstances and situation in Asia that we've talked about extensively, with outbound travel in Asia, in particular, being impacted and recovering slower than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And so, those are the two variables in terms of the - to get the Q4 guidance consistent with the intent - that I communicated. And then as far as FY '25 goes, we're at the beginning end of planning, and as we always do, we'll share our expectations on '25 at the end of Q4.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. I guess more of a big picture question here, Ryan. So your AI and gen AI investment, you've talked about, I think at conferences, your desire to kind of build out your own large language model. So I'm wondering, one, where do those investments stand today? I guess, two, what would be your expectation for early use cases of those investments, and kind of the payback period? And then three, is there an opportunity to drive, like true incremental sales, or better outcomes for your merchant constituents as opposed to just the banks? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. Hi, Dan, thanks for the question on AI. First of all, to frame it is, we are all in on gen AI at Visa as we've been all in on predictive AI, for more than a decade. We're applying it in two broad-based different ways. One is, sort of adopting across the company to drive productivity, and we're seeing real results there. We're seeing great results, great adoption, great productivity increases from technology, to accounting to sales all across the company. The second is applying generative AI to enhance the entire payment ecosystem. And to the latter part of your question, absolutely. I guess I'd give you one set of examples or some of the risk tools and capabilities that we've been deploying in the market. I mentioned the risk products that we're using on RTP and account-to-account payments. That is an opportunity to reduce fraud, both for merchants and for issuers. I think I mentioned on a previous call, we have our Visa Provisioning Intelligence Service, which is using artificial intelligence to help predict token provisioning fraud before it happens. That also is a benefit to both issuers and merchants. And the list goes on. So, we are very optimistic about the positive impact that generative AI can have, not just on our own productivity, but on our ability to help drive increased sales and lower fraud across the ecosystem.\nJennifer Como: We'll do one more question, please.\nOperator: For our final question, we'll go to the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon. Ryan, Chris U.S. card volume growth of 5% in surface kind of suggests a little bit more of a mature market. Now I understand the category differences between card volume growth and DC growth, which influence the delta here. Ryan, you discussed your global down estimate of $20 trillion in consumer payments for Visa. How should we think about, the secular digitization opportunity and the growth algorithm for the U.S., which is your biggest market? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Okay. It was a little hard for us to hear you, Harshita, but I think I got the gist of your question around the growth algorithm for consumer payments, especially in mature markets. So as I've said before, we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity around the world. About a quarter of that is in the U.S., by the way. And that's cash, that's check, that's ACH, that's electronic transactions, that's cards that run on domestic networks and the like. And we're capturing that opportunity through a few different ways. One is continuing to expand acceptance and expand the places, where people can use cards. In the U.S., rent would be a great example. We've been having some really good success, penetrating the rent vertical. The second is making it easier to drive e-commerce growth and e-commerce transactions, which has an outsourced impact on our ability to drive growth on Visa, for those types of things. And third is just continuing to innovate with new products and services that, make our issuers want to issue Visa and consumers want to use them. We announced a full slate of new product innovations at our Visa Payments Forum this year. And those are the types of products that, we believe are going to help us win in the marketplace, and help us capture and digitize a big chunk of that opportunity on the Visa network.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, all, for participating in the Visa fiscal third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's conference.

All participant lines are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you object, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to your host Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed on this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release and related materials available on our IR website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered strong second quarter results with $8.8 billion in net revenue up 10%, GAAP EPS up 12% and non-GAAP EPS up 20%. For our key business drivers, we saw relative stability. Overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year in constant dollars, US payment volume grew 6% year-over-year and international payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume excluding Intra-Europe rose 16% year-over-year and process transactions grew 11%. Visa's business performance demonstrates our strategy at work in consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Furthermore, across all of these growth levers, tremendous opportunity remains. I'll spend a few moments on each growth lever. Let's start with consumer payments. The opportunity in consumer payments is enormous. Based on the latest public data from calendar year 2022 and our analysis, we estimate that the total global purchase personal consumption expenditure or PPCE excluding Russia and China was approximately $40 trillion. Within that $40 trillion, our addressable opportunity is more than $20 trillion. This includes three components. One, cash and check, which is about half of the addressable opportunity. Tap-to-pay is a great example of how we are converting small ticket cash transactions to Visa credentials. Two, ACH and other electronic transactions. We have many examples in this space, including the work we are doing to extend Visa as a bill pay method in acceptance categories like rent, education and loan repayments. And three, cards that run primarily on domestic networks. We have been focused on converting these domestic based cards to Visa credentials in countries around the world and I'll share a good example from Europe in a moment. There is a very long runway ahead and I remain excited about Visa's future growth opportunity in consumer payments. We continue to capture that growth by delivering innovative and secure payment solutions for buyers and sellers, including new credentials and issuance, tap-to-pay and e-commerce. I'll briefly talk about each. First, we're making great progress in expanding the number of Visa credentials. We have added over 100 million credentials from September to December for a year-over-year growth rate of 6%. One area of focus is in Europe. With the UK growing credentials at its fastest rate since 2016, driven in part by strong growth from fintech clients. In addition, from 2018 to 2023, we converted more than 20 million credentials in Europe that primarily ran on domestic networks to Visa debit credentials with millions more in the process of being migrated. This is a great example of the opportunity I mentioned a moment ago. We're particularly excited as we prepare for the Paris Olympics, which are less than 100 days away. We have close to 300 clients across 85 countries globally working with Visa to activate our Olympic sponsorship for marketing campaigns and cardholder engagements such as credential issuance and onsite cardholder events. And in Europe alone, we expect our clients to have issued over 5 million Olympic and Paralympic branded Visa credentials before the start of the games. Also this quarter in Europe, we renewed our relationship with Caixa Geral de Depositos in Portugal across consumer credit, debit and prepaid and commercial credit and debit as well as a suite of value-added services, including risk solutions and analytics. Another area of strength is our co-brand issuance. Visa is the primary network partner for eight of the top 10 co-brand partnerships in the US today and we are pleased that Visa has finalized a multi-year extension of our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio that benefits from a loyal customer base and high cross-border usage. We have also had significant co-brand momentum in CEMEA. First, we launched a new co-brand card in partnership with Qatar Airways, British Airways and the National Bank of Kuwait. Second, we expanded our strong global Marriott relationship to launch Qatar's first hospitality co-branded card with Qatar Islamic Bank. Across the United Arab Emirates, we now have exclusive agreements with all the leading airlines marked by a recent agreement with Emirates Skywards. And we also signed an inaugural Airline co-brand agreement in Morocco with Royal Air Maroc. Now newer digital issuers are equally important to our future growth in consumer payments. And in Saudi Arabia, fintech stc pay, which has over 12 million customers is transitioning from a digital wallet to a full digital bank and expanding its Visa prepay business into Visa debit and credit. Digital Bank Maya in the Philippines has chosen Visa to offer its millions of mobile wallet users and bank depositors access to consumer credit cards with new issuance of affluent products. In the US, we signed a newly expanded credit deal with brokerage platform Robinhood, including the launch of a new Robinhood Gold Card, which offers 3% cashback for all purchases. In Europe, broker and savings platform Trade Republic has launched a new Visa card that combines spending and savings for their 4 million customers across 17 markets. Over 1 million people joined the waitlist for the card in just a few weeks. As I've mentioned in the past, we feel great about our products, our value-added services, our new flows capabilities, our brand, and our people, all coming together to deepen and expand our partnerships with our clients around the world. As we think about Visa's growth, tap-to-pay and e-commerce are key drivers in the digitization of payments. This quarter, tap-to-pay grew five percentage points from last year to 79% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the US. Of note, Japan nearly doubled its penetration since last year to almost 30%. In the US, in the second quarter, we're nearing 50% penetration with New York City at over 75%. The first US city to reach this milestone up from 50% two years ago, demonstrating the impact that transit and our focused issuance and acceptance have on accelerating growth. On the e-commerce front, we continued to see Visa's US e-commerce payments volume grow several points faster year-over-year than face-to-face spend. And the same is true in many key countries around the world, including Canada, Brazil, Australia and India. And this matters to Visa's growth because in the e-commerce space, cash is not usually an option. And although e-commerce payments are a highly competitive environment, we believe our capabilities and our focus on safety, security, reliability, and user experience position us very well. Adding to the potential for growth is tokenization, which brings several benefits to the ecosystem, especially in e-commerce, including reducing fraud, improving authorization rates and therefore making it easier for a customer to purchase a good or service. As of the second quarter, we have over 9.5 billion tokens globally and have surpassed a milestone of 1 billion tokens in Asia-Pacific joining the ranks of the US and Europe. We continue to be focused across all of these efforts in addition to seeking new areas of acceptance and spending. Now moving to new flows. We mentioned last quarter that we see $200 trillion of opportunity excluding Russia and China and we are delivering Visa's commercial and money movement solutions to help digitize these flows. This quarter, new flows revenue growth improved to 14% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis with Visa Direct overall transactions growing 31% for the quarter to $2.3 billion and commercial volumes up 8% year-over-year in constant dollars. Throughout the quarter, we remain focused on our Visa Direct strategy across several areas of growth, including through new use cases, expansion to new geographies and enablers. One recent example is our expanded agreement with Thunes, which increased the number of countries in which Visa Direct can enable push-to-wallet from 78 to 108. In addition, Thunes is implementing Visa Direct's push-to-card capability to enable payouts made to eligible Visa cards and accounts. We have also expanded earned wage access in Canada through an agreement with Payfare and have brought our first Visa Direct cross-border capability into Taiwan with Taishin Bank. On the enabler front, we are pleased that our long-time partner JPMorgan Payments will be seamlessly integrating Visa Direct into their acquiring operations to offer their business clients faster push payments capabilities. In addition, we continued to deepen our relationship with Chase in the small business market with investment and enhancements in products and services. And in accounts receivable and payable, we renewed and expanded our multi-year agreement with Bill on their accounts payable, spend and expense management platforms. We have also reached a global partnership with Taulia, an SAP company and a leading provider of working capital management solutions. The collaboration will incorporate Visa's digital payments technology into Taulia's virtual cards, a solution that integrates with SAP ERP solutions and business applications to make embedded finance accessible for businesses through a seamless and streamlined payments experience for buyers and suppliers. One vertical in new flows that has immense potential is government payments, representing over $15 trillion in annual payments volume opportunity, where we are in a strong position to combine many of our new flows offerings. A recent example is in Kenya, where we signed an agreement with Pesaflow, a technology partner for the government of Kenya to expand card payments on eCitizen, the government's electronic platform with over 12 million users. We achieved this by bringing together Visa Virtual credentials and Visa Direct into the platform. Now let me move on to value-added services, where revenue was up 23% in the second quarter in constant dollars. The growth and opportunity in value-added services continue to be significant and broad-based. In Acceptance Solutions, we signed an agreement with Millicom International Cellular in Latin America for cybersource gateway, decision manager and token management solutions. As it relates to open banking, just about two years ago, we acquired Tink as we saw the opportunity in open banking to enable the movement of data and money and to provide consumers with control over their financial data. Over those two years, we have been expanding our presence in Europe, winning deals with such as Adyen and Revolut. We're now expanding open banking solutions through Tink into the United States having signed several data access agreements, including with Capital One, Fiserv, and Jack Henry, so that their customers may share data with Tink. We've also signed partnerships on the fintech and merchant side including Dwolla and Max Rewards. And across our risk offerings, we continue to bolster them through our technology, innovation and AI expertise and are expanding their utility beyond the Visa network. Recently, we announced three such capabilities in our Visa Protect offering. The first is the expansion of our signature solutions Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager for non-VISA card payments making them network agnostic. This allows issuers to simplify their fraud operations into a single fraud detection solution. The second is the release of Visa Protect for account-to-account payments, our first fraud prevention solution built specifically for real-time payments, including P2P digital wallets, account-to-account transactions and Central Bank's instant payment systems. Powered by AI-based fraud detection models, this new service provides a real-time risk score that can be used to identify fraud on account-to-account payments. We've been piloting both of these in a number of countries and our strong results thus far have informed our decision to roll these out globally. The third solution is Visa Deep Authorization. It is a new transaction risk scoring solution tailored specifically to the US market to better manage e-commerce payments powered by a world-class deep learning recurrent neural network model and petabytes of contextual data. We also continue to make our offerings available through third-party platforms. We mentioned ServiceNow last quarter and we are excited to have recently joined the AWS Partner Network to help seamlessly provide our clients running systems in the cloud access to Visa's solutions, initially starting with Currencycloud, now known as Visa Cross-Border Solutions and Pismo. We also signed an agreement with Stripe for them to distribute Verify solutions through a self-service dispute management platform for their merchants. All of these efforts are part of our strategy to build and offer our solutions for both Visa and our network of networks. Before I hand it to Chris, I wanted to note that we have commenced the exchange offer for Visa's Class B1 common stock that is set to expire at the end of next week. I also wanted to highlight that this quarter, after nearly 20 years of litigation, we have agreed to a landmark settlement with US merchants, more than 90% of which are small businesses, lowering credit interchange rates and capping those rates into 2030 once approved by the court. The injunctive relief class settlement also provides updates to several key network rules, giving merchants more choice in how they accept digital payments. Last, let me share a few closing thoughts on the quarter and beyond. First, our second quarter was marked by stable results and strengthened relationships with clients across the globe. Second, as we head into the back half of our fiscal year and beyond, new flows and value-added services remain key areas of focus. We also see significant opportunity in consumer payments by digitizing cash and check, enhancing our capabilities in e-commerce, and building new solutions for our network of networks. I could not be more excited for what lies ahead. Finally, all of this is possible because of the 30,000 Visa employees who come to work every day in service of our clients and partners, I am grateful for everything that you do, thank you. And now over to Chris.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q2 was a strong quarter with relatively stable growth across payments volume, process transactions, and cross-border volume. Looking at our drivers, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year and process transactions grew 11% year-over-year. Cross-border volume growth excluding Intra-Europe was up 16% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal second quarter net revenue was up 10% in nominal and constant dollars, which was slightly above our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives and better-than-expected value-added services revenue that collectively more than offset lower-than-expected currency volatility. GAAP EPS was up 12% and non-GAAP EPS was up 20% in nominal and 21% in constant dollars. So let's go into the details, starting with total payments volume. Global payments volume growth in Q2 was 8%, consistent with Q1 growth. There are a couple of things I'd like to highlight when comparing Q2 to Q1. First, the extra day for the leap year was a benefit to the quarter. This was offset primarily by slowing payments volume growth in Asia-Pacific mostly due to macroeconomic weakness in Mainland China. When we adjust for Asia and some other smaller factors, we see second quarter global payments volume growth generally in line with the first quarter. Now on to the US. US payments volume grew 6% year-over-year, credit grew 6% and debit grew 6%. Card present spend grew 4% and card not present volume grew 8%. Reg II had a similar modest impact in Q2 as we saw in Q1. When we normalize for leap year, we see relatively stable US payments volume growth. Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments. Moving to international markets, where total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars. Payments volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe, ex-UK, each growing more than 19% in constant dollars. Normalized for leap year and weakness in Mainland China, total international payments volume growth was relatively stable to the first quarter. As a reminder, domestic volumes in Mainland China drive a very small amount of revenue and therefore the impact to our financial statements is not significant. Now to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding Intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volumes were up a healthy 16% in Q2 generally in line with our expectations. Cross-border card not present volume growth, excluding travel and adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases was in the mid-teens, stronger than expected. Cross-border travel volume was up 17% or 152% indexed to 2019. Consistent with our expectations for the year, we continue to see strong travel volume growth in and out of LAC, Europe, and CEMEA and out of the US ranging from 158% to 192% of 2019 levels. The US inbound travel volume has continued to recover within our expectations up several points from Q1 versus 2019 levels. Asia-Pacific travel volume continues to recover, but the pace has been slower than we anticipated. Travel volume into Asia indexed at 142% of 2019 levels for the quarter, up eight points from Q1, while travel volume out of Asia was up two points to 124% of 2019. We see the primary drivers being one, macroeconomic weakness in key markets like Australia and Mainland China two, weakness in some Asia-Pacific currencies, which is impacting consumer purchasing power, particularly for Japan and three, airline capacity that is still below 2019 levels, particularly the Mainland China and North American corridor. Altogether, we're pleased with our total cross-border volume growth with e-commerce growth generally offsetting the travel weakness in Asia and this is a great testament to the strength and diversification of our model. Now let's review our second quarter financial results starting with the revenue components. Both service revenue and data processing revenue grew generally in line with their underlying drivers, which resulted in their respective revenue yields remaining relatively consistent to the first quarter. Service revenue grew 7% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q1 constant dollar payments volume. Data processing revenue grew 12% versus the 11% process transaction growth. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe, impacted by lapping strong currency volatility from last year. As volatility reached lows that we haven't seen in about four years, the revenue growth was lower than we expected. Other revenue grew 37%, primarily driven by strong consulting and marketing services revenue growth and to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 12%, lower than we expected due to client performance and deal timing. Across our three growth engines, consumer payments growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volume. New flows revenue improved as expected to 14% year-over-year growth in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions improved to 31% year-over-year growth helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Commercial volumes rose 8% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Q2, value-added services revenue grew 23% in constant dollars to $2.1 billion, primarily driven by issuing and acceptance solutions and advisory services. GAAP operating expenses increased 29% driven by increases in the litigation provision and G&A expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 11% primarily due to increases in G&A and personnel expenses. FX and Pismo each represented an approximately half point headwind. Excluding net losses from our equity investments of $30 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $189 million. Our GAAP tax rate was 15.4% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 16% due to the resolution of some non-US tax matters. GAAP EPS was $2.29 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.51, up 20% over last year, inclusive of an almost one point drag from exchange rates and an approximately half point drag from Pismo. In Q2, we bought back approximately 2.7 billion in stock and distributed over 1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of March, we had 23.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now, let's move to what we've seen so far in April through the 21st. US payments volume was up 4% with debit up 4% and credit up 5% year-over-year, down from March, primarily due to Easter timing. Process transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe grew 15% year-over-year. Travel-related cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe grew 15% year-over-year in constant dollars or 151% indexed to 2019. And cross-border card not present ex-travel grew 15% in constant dollars. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentations for more detail. Let's start with the full year. We are reaffirming our prior year guidance for the full year for adjusted net revenue and operating expense growth in the low-double-digits and EPS growth in the low-teens. As for drivers, things are progressing generally as we expected, except for the trends in Asia that we discussed. Accordingly, we are making a small adjustment to our outlook for total payments volume growth to the high-single-digits from the low-double-digits. Total cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe is expected to continue to grow strongly in the mid-teens with the strength in e-commerce generally offsetting weakness in Asia travel. Remember that our drivers assume no recession or no further increase in Reg II impacts. Currency volatility remains low and we are assuming volatility in the third quarter continues at a similar rate to the second quarter and adjusts up slightly in the fourth quarter. Now on to the third quarter expectations. We expect adjusted net revenue growth in the low-double-digits, generally in line to the adjusted second quarter growth rate. Adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter are expected to grow in the low-teens, driven primarily by Olympic-related marketing expense due to the strong client engagement that Ryan referenced. Non-operating income is expected to be between $50 million and $60 million and the tax rate is expected to be between 19% and 19.5% in Q3 with the full year unchanged. This puts third-quarter adjusted EPS growth in the high end of low-double-digits. For the third quarter, Pismo is expected to have minimal benefit to net revenue growth and an approximately one point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense and an approximately half point drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. FX for the third quarter is expected to have an approximately one point drag to net revenue growth and approximately one and a half point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and an approximately half point drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. In summary, we had another solid quarter in Q2 with relatively stable underlying drivers and strong financial results. We feel good about the momentum in our business as we head into the second half across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. We remain thoughtful with our spending plans as we continue to balance between short and long-term considerations in the context of a changing environment. So now, Jennifer, let's do some Q&A.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Holly.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first caller is Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Chris, a clarification question. You mentioned Easter was mainly affecting the quarter-to-date trends. Is it fair to assume that the growth rate would be commensurate with the last quarter if you adjust it for that? And then just on a related matter, did the tax refund timings have any impact later in the quarter or in the quarter or into the quarter-to-date trends? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So April volumes, as I said on the call, through the first three weeks were lower than March -- the month of March. This was due to the timing of Easter, which again was in March this year and April of last year. And so once you factor that into March and April growth rates, the change between the months are -- the change in growth rate is not meaningful. As far as tax payments at this point, I don't really have an update. Largely they've been consistent at this point year-to-date.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Our next caller is Timothy Chiodo with UBS. You may go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. There were some helpful comments around the e-commerce strength within cross-border offsetting some of the travel weakness. When we think about the components of overall cross-border, clearly, there's the traditional travel, so card present and card not present. And then there's the traditional e-commerce, right, so retail e-commerce. But there are other faster growing but smaller portions, whether it be the remittances or marketplace payouts or you gave the Thunes example earlier. I was wondering if you could maybe size the, in aggregate, how large some of those other maybe faster growing portions of cross-border have become as a part of the overall mix?\nChris Suh: Yeah, sure. Why don't I start? Yeah, we don't have specifics to break-out. As we talked about, the e-commerce business has been strong. It continues to grow above what we expected. The yields across our entire cross-border business are positive and accretive to Visa overall. And so we're happy with all flavors of cross-border, but I don't have a further breakout for you in terms of the pieces that you were asking about.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Our next caller is Craig Maurer with FT Partners. You may go ahead .\nCraig Maurer: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question on US debit trends. April continued the trend of weakening that we've seen -- that we saw also in March and basically since February. I wanted to know to what degree your guidance for both third quarter and the year embeds continued weakening in US debit. It seems if we look at the restaurant data released by the likes of Darden that the lower-income portion of the US is significantly reducing spend in certain areas. So curious about commentary there. Thanks.\nChris Suh: Yeah. As we talked about on the call, we see quite stable -- relatively stable volumes in the US across credit and debit, normalizing for the things that I talked about. And so in addition, as I talked about Reg II, the impact remains stable as well. And so from our perspective, our data indicates stable volume growth in the US.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Our next caller is Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. You may go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on new flows, so a nice recovery there in growth. Can you give a comment on what areas were most pronounced in the underlying growth recovery relative to what you saw last quarter?\nChris Suh: Yeah. Let me talk about Q2 growth. The two pieces of information that we gave you in terms of Q2 growth. We saw commercial volume growth globally 8%, stable to Q1 and in fact, stable over the last several quarters. And we saw very strong growth in Visa direct transactions, growing 31% for the quarter. New flows revenue in total growing 14%, which was in line with our expectations that we shared with you at the start of the year. I think the recovery that you're referencing to was because Q1 growth was lower and that was really due to some lapping issues that were one-time and non-recurring, which we passed at this point.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Our next caller is Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nWill Nance: Hey, guys. I appreciate you taking the question. A bit of a dual-part question on just some of the prior guidance commentary you made around first-half versus second-half dynamics and some of the drivers of acceleration over the course of the year. And I guess specifically, I guess, incentives, you talked about a step-down in the growth rate from first half to second half. Is that still your expectation despite that coming in a lot lower in the most recent quarter? And then for the similar question on the volume growth trends, I guess, I hear you on the Asia trends, but I guess overall, you had some kind of upbeat commentary on ticket sizes over the course of the year and kind of easing inflation in comps, it seems like gas prices might help that as well. So just any commentary on ticket sizes and specifically the negative ticket sizes you've seen in the US? Any commentary on kind of what's structural versus kind of more environmental there? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Yeah. Okay. Let me start first with incentives, the first part of your question. So, as you all have seen from quarter-to-quarter, incentive growth can vary based on a number of factors, client performance, deal timing, which is what caused half one to come in lower than anticipated. For our outlook for the second half of the year, our expectations remain largely unchanged. We still expect year-over-year growth to be lower in the second half than in the first half as we lap the higher incentives that we saw starting in the second half of last year. And we do expect the Q4 incentive growth rate will be the lowest growth quarter of the year. So expectations for half two are unchanged. To your second question on ATS, let me -- there's a lot of moving parts in here. And so maybe I'm just going to kind of go through it in detail and unpack bit by bit. Globally, Q2 ATS year-over-year growth was down slightly, which is consistent with the growth that we saw in Q1. Breaking that apart between the US and international. In the US, ticket size growth actually continued to improve from Q1 to Q2, still slightly negative, but the trend improved from Q1 to Q2. And looking ahead in the US, this is something that we've spoken to previously, we do continue to expect ATS will turn positive in the second half of this year as we lap the lower ticket sizes in the second half of last year. Internationally, outside of Asia-Pacific, let's set that aside for a second, we saw improvement in several regions, including the impact from higher inflation in several markets. And so overall, excluding Asia, we still expect ATS to turn positive in the second half based on the expected improvements in the US with the impact of Asia factored in, global ATS will be slightly negative and that was factored into the revised payment volume outlook that I gave for the full year.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Our next caller is Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. You may go ahead.\nMoshe Katri: Hey, thanks for taking my question. It seems that there was a pretty significant uptick sequentially in growth for value-added services. Is there anything to call out there? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: I mean, I'll talk about the business just for a minute, Moshe. Thanks for the question and then, Chris, you can add any specific callouts. As I think I said in my prepared remarks, the business is really hitting its strides in a lot of different areas in terms of the product we're bringing to market, the success our sales teams are having around the world, we're really focused on three big areas of trying to drive growth. One is just deepening the penetration of products we have with existing clients. That's -- if you think about it is the most near-term opportunity that we have and we've got metrics, client-by-client all around the world, what are they using, what are they not using. We're arming our sales teams with that. We're building case studies on how we can help them and we're driving progress in terms of deepening the relationship we have with our existing clients. And then we're building new products that we're bringing to market. I mentioned a few of those in my prepared remarks today, both in the risk and fraud space as well as in the open banking space and then driving geographic expansion. I mentioned I think just one cybersource deal in my prepared remarks, but cybersource has been a great example of a platform where we've been having success growing in markets where we hadn't traditionally been as deep. AP is actually a positive example of that in the cybersource space. So those are a couple of call-outs, Moshe, in terms of kind of how we're just seeing the broader business.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next caller is Cris Kennedy with William Blair. You may go ahead.\nCristopher Kennedy: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about bringing Tink into the US. Can you talk about the open banking opportunity in the US relative to Europe? Thank you.\nChris Suh: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. I think Europe is the most developed open banking market in the world. We bought Tink two years ago believing that it was the best platform in Europe and I think that's proven true over the couple of years that we've had a chance to own it. On the client side, in Europe, we've been making great progress. I think I mentioned a couple in my prepared remarks, we've been -- we've been winning business and winning share with both fintechs as well as more traditional banks, merchants, and others, both in the payment side of things and in the account information side of things. I would describe the US market as less developed as Europe. And so I think it's an opportunity for us to take the learnings that we've had in the much more developed Europe market as well as the success we've had with our clients, the products, the services, the wins and the losses and bring all of that to the US market. So we're excited to do that. And as I mentioned, I think the US market is still at the very early stages of its development. So I think it's a good time for us to be a competitor in the market. And we're hopeful that over the coming quarters and years, we'll have a chance to share with you a lot of the success that we have in the US market.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next caller is Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nDaniel Perlin: Thanks. Ryan, I just wanted to ask a question on the Visa Deep Authorization commentary and kind of that market there. I just want to make sure I understand, are you -- are you doing this as a means with which to like equalize kind of e-commerce across the market for authorization rates, so that like acquirers need to be partnered with you more specifically and therefore, they're not competing maybe shows individually on kind of author rates within e-commerce or is there something different within this platform? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Hey, Dan. Let me backup. I think this is a little different than what you were describing. What we found in the US e-commerce market is that it's the most -- on the one hand, it's the most developed e-commerce market on the planet. On the other hand, it's become the place of the most sophisticated fraud and attack vectors that we see anywhere in the world. And so what we were bringing -- we are bringing to market with Visa Deep Authorization is an e-commerce transaction risk scoring platform and capability that is specifically tailored and built for the unique sets of attack vectors that we're seeing in the US. So it's -- as I was mentioning in my prepared remarks, it's built on deep learning technology that's specifically tuned to some of the sequential and contextual view of accounts that we've had in the US market. And the whole goal is what we do with a lot of our fraud and authorization products. We want to -- we want to make it a better buyer and seller experience. We want to reduce fraud rates, increase authorization rates, increase shopping conversion for our merchant partners. And we think Visa Deep Authorization is going to be yet another tool that will help do that.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next caller is Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks so much. It sounded like the Middle East deal activity is in a good place here. I believe Emirates is a takeaway for you. I'm just curious if there's something new going on there from a pipeline perspective. It sounds like maybe some investing. Is this the growth market we should be paying more attention to maybe? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. I think what you're seeing is good execution from our sales team, doing what we do when we do it best, which is in with our clients, listening, learning, obsessing about what's important to them and then bringing them products and value propositions that are helping meet their needs and drive their strategies and really just kudos to our team on the ground there and the great work that they're doing.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next caller is Trevor Williams with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nTrevor Williams: Great. Thanks a lot. This one is for Ryan. Just wanted to go back to the merchant settlement in the US, clearly you guys aren't directly impacted by lower interchange, but I'm just curious kind of what you're expecting the downstream impact to be on Visa, the relationships between you and your issuing banks. And if you think it in any way kind of changes the competitive dynamics at all within the US credit market? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Thanks, Trevor. I think the good news on this front is it brings clarity and stability to the market. This is litigation that's been out there for the better part of 20 years or so. I think there's been a lot of great work that's been done to bring this to a resolution. Just to remind everyone what the main planks of the resolution are. It really is two different sets of things. One is it will reduce interchange for US -- for credit cards in the US market for both Visa and Mastercard and it will have no increases in interchange for the five years of the agreement. And then the second set of things are tools that give merchants more flexibility to how they manage payments significant -- specifically as it relates to surcharging and things like that. I think, overall, it's what I said, Trevor, which is clarity and stability that lets everybody who operates in the US market move on and move on continuing to grow the digitization of this great payments ecosystem that we've all collectively built in the United States.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. You may go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon. So, Ryan, I want to follow up on value-added services, such an important part of your growth story. I know you've talked about the five types of services you offer and how your top 250 clients use almost 2x the number of services versus the rest of your client base. Can you give us some sense on how these penetration numbers have evolved over time? And finally as you kind of think about pricing for these services, to what extent it's a bundle pricing along with core versus kind of a separately priced service? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Okay. You have a great memory. As we've said, our top 265 clients or so use on average about 22 of our value-added services. We don't talk about like how that's moved quarter-to-quarter, but the opportunity is enormous just when you think about the number of clients we have around the planet. And so as I was mentioning earlier kind of what we've done is we've armed our frontline teams with kind of client-by-client, what are they using, what are they not using, what are the opportunities to create value for the client by putting value-added services A, B, C or D to work for them and we're having great success and you see that in the numbers. In terms of the pricing, it's -- it's different pricing models for different products and different suites of solutions in different places around the world. We're always trying to come up with the right product pricing mix that's going to work best for our products in the market. And we have a portfolio of value-added services that span from issuing to acceptance to risk and identity to advisory into open banking and the competitive sets are deep and different in all of those markets. So we're bringing different pricing approaches to each and every market around the world to help meet the best that we can for our clients.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next caller is Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. You may go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about one of the consumer payment opportunities that Ryan called out, namely taking share from domestic card networks. How do you drive that? Is it just a question of getting banks to issue more of your cards or is it more on the acceptance or consumer side? What are the levers that you have to basically speed that up?\nChris Suh: Yeah. Thanks for the question. On the -- it's really the first of the things that you mentioned. Now, of course, we need to have great acceptance. We need to have great capabilities and all those types of things, which we do in every market we operate around the planet. So then it becomes sitting down with clients, helping them understand the value of, for example, a Visa debit card versus a card that runs primarily on domestic schemes. And then you get into e-commerce capabilities that Visa Debit is able to provide their clients that maybe they don't get the same type of capabilities from the domestic scheme. You get to cross-border travel opportunities that their customers would have if they were using a Visa card versus one of those domestic schemes that I mentioned. You also get into the risk and fraud prevention capabilities that I mentioned earlier and the ability to have more transactions approved and lower fraud rates, tokenization, I mean, all these kind of benefits, you've heard us talk about over and over again, those are what our teams can sit down with the clients and explain to them. Often the clients will do some pilots and some tests, they'll see the results, they'll see higher spend, they'll see higher client satisfaction. And then ultimately the decision to issue Visa cards to their clients becomes a very clear decision for them.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next caller is Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. You may go ahead.\nJames Friedman: Hi. I was wondering if you could share some color on how Prosa is doing so far and how you view the opportunity in Mexico as you start to press and productize into the Mexican market. Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yeah. Thanks, Jamie. We view the Mexican opportunity as a very significant one. And coincidentally, I was just down there a couple of weeks ago meeting with clients and meeting with the Prosa team as well. So as I think I explained on one of these calls, today, because we don't process transactions domestically in Mexico, we're not able to deliver a lot of the value-added services that I've mentioned over the course of this call to our clients. And so first and foremost, our clients are very excited about us having the opportunity to have a majority ownership stake in Prosa and then bring these world class capabilities that we've built to the Mexican market, the things I mentioned earlier, tokenization or the risk scoring algorithms that I mentioned or the e-commerce capabilities that I mentioned those types of things. Now Prosa itself is a great asset. It's been operating for 50 years in Mexico has deep processing experience, it has scale. They do more than 10 billion transactions annually. They have a great base of clients. So it's really the combination of both Prosa's experience and deep footprint in the Mexican market combined with our experience, our technology, our track record in bringing a lot of these services to market, the combination of those two things gives us a lot of confidence and our clients a lot of confidence that we can digitize the significant amount of cash and check and electronic payments that exist today in Mexico.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Schmidt with Citi. You may go ahead.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey, Ryan. Hey, Chris. Thanks for having me on the call here. I wanted to go back to cross-border for a second. Obviously, a part of the back-half growth is the narrowing of the spread between cross-border revs and volumes. Maybe if you could talk a little about how, whether those assumptions have changed at all with FX volumes coming down or if there's other puts and takes we should consider there? Thanks a lot.\nChris Suh: Yeah, sure. Yeah, I spoke at length about volatility. So we had -- in Q2 we saw volatility -- currency volatility at multiyear lows. This one is hard to predict. In Q3, our assumption, what's embedded in the guidance for Q3 is that the currency volatility levels remain at this low level. We do have, again, embedded in our forecast. We do anticipate that Q4 improves slightly. That's generally in line with market expectations. But, yeah, that is our view of currency volatility. That said, the underlying health of our business as we enter the second half of the year, we feel really good about across consumer payments, across new flows, across value-added services. And so volatility is sort of the variable and we'll have to see how it comes in.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you, guys. Can you talk about your second half expectations for new flows and VAS revenue growth as well as cross-border travel volume growth? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Sure. Let me unpack that a little bit. From a -- as you heard us, we reaffirmed our prior year guide for the full year, adjusted net revenue growth, OpEx, EPS. And within that, I spoke about the fact that volatility is going to cause our currency volatility -- treasury revenues in international to be lower than we anticipated in Q3. But again full year unchanged within that. Our expectations for new flows in that are consistent with the ones that we shared at the beginning of the year, which we anticipated. For the full year, new flows will grow faster than consumer payments with weighted toward faster growth in the second half of the year. We're seeing that with the 14% growth in Q2. We anticipate continuing to see a good growth in the second half of the year. Value-added services has grown over 20% in each of the first two quarters. The momentum there is pretty evident. The second part of your question was, I think, around cross-border travel of volumes in total. So we did make a little bit of adjustment. You heard me talk about based on half-one trends. And so again, this is one with a couple of parts, so let's just go through it in detail. First of all, we feel really good, feel great about our first-half total cross-border performance, 16% growth in Q2, in line with our expectations, and within that, travel was 17% and e-commerce growth mid-teens better than expected. And so that unpacking travel a bit, we've seen most of our travel volume expectations play out actually as we planned at the beginning of the year, which continues to be strong and healthy in most regions LAC, Europe, CEMEA and all the ones that I talked about on the call, with Asia being the exception to that, which again continues to improve with the pace of recovery being slower than expected, offset again by strength in the e-commerce cross-border business, which is performing better than we expected.So we expect these trends to continue into the second half and thus, we've moderated our outlook for travel due to AP and upped our expectations on e-commerce. So putting that all together, overall, our view is that total cross-border volumes remain strong, growing in the mid-teens in the second half, which is frankly the better measure in relation to our financial performance given the strong yields across both travel and e-commerce.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. You may go ahead.\nKenneth Suchoski: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of my questions have been asked. I just want to ask about the service yields, though, because they came in a little bit lighter than we were expecting. So can you just talk about what drove that? It looks like the service yield declined year-over-year, but maybe there's some offset with client incentives also coming a little bit lower in the quarter. So any detail there would be helpful. Any thoughts on how to think about the year-over-year change in that yield going forward? Thanks.\nChris Suh: As we talked about both service revenue and data processing revenue grew generally in line with the underlying drivers, service revenue at 7% versus the 8% in constant dollar PV, Q1 constant dollar PV that's impacted by a number of smaller things, none of which I would call out as a single thing. Data processing revenue grew a little bit above processed transactions, 1.12 versus 11 and that was helped aided a little bit by pricing. From a yield perspective, I think the thing that's important is that our second quarter yields remained consistent with Q1 and consistent with the average over the last several quarters. And so we're seeing very stable yields across the business and we're pleased to see that. And even more broadly, our net revenue yield across the whole company remained quite stable.\nJennifer Como: Great. And last question please, Holly.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital. You may go ahead.\nPaul Golding: Thanks so much. Ryan, you were talking about the addressable opportunity of $20 trillion of which cash and check was half. I was wondering if you can give any thought to quantifying the ACH versus the domestic network conversion and where you think you are in that opportunity capture for each of those. Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yeah, thanks. We're having great success in all three. I gave you examples. Some of our teams are ahead of others in different parts of the world and domestic schemes are more prevalent in some parts of the world than others like I mentioned Europe as an example. But the opportunity is enormous in all three of these areas and we've been having really good success in all three of the areas.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our Investor Relations team. Thanks again and have a great day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice-President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\nJennifer Como: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. We are off to a solid start in 2024. Consumer spending remained resilient with first-quarter year-over-year payments volume growth at 8%. U.S. payments volume grew 5% year-over-year. International payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe rose 16% year-over-year in constant dollars with cross-border travel at 142% of 2019 levels, up from 139% in the fourth quarter. Processed transactions rose 9%. Our net revenues increased 9% with GAAP EPS up 20% and non-GAAP EPS up 11%. As I reflect on the execution of our strategy this quarter across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, I wanted to highlight a few key themes. One, we remain obsessed about serving our customers including traditional bank partners, neobanks, fintechs, wallets, sellers, acquirers and everyone else. Our focus on clients has enabled us to deepen our relationships with partners across all three pillars of our strategy. Two, we continue to seek new partnerships, new use cases and new verticals to drive our business forward with a particular emphasis on cross-border. Three, we have gone to market with innovative solutions across our network of networks, seeking to add value for all transactions, no matter the network. And four, we are always looking for new and innovative ways to amplify our brand in service of our partners. With those themes in mind, let me provide some more details on the quarter. Let's start with consumer payments. We saw continued growth in credentials, acceptance and engagement. Credentials grew 6% and we now have more than 8.7 billion network tokens, up 55%. Acceptance locations grew 17%. And let me highlight two recent examples of where we have expanded acceptance. The first was in Brazil with Caixa for cash conversion at their over 10,000 lottery branches. They are now accepting Visa credit and debit cards to pay for utilities, tax collection, lotteries and voucher payments which are called boletos. Another example was in Asia-Pacific where we signed an agreement with Bcash, the largest mobile financial services player in Bangladesh. Already a client with Visa Direct, they now have enabled Visa's 15 million plus cardholders in the country to use their in-app QR code to pay at more than 550,000 Bcash merchants. These examples demonstrate our local approach to expanding our global acceptance footprint. Tap to pay grew five percentage points from last year to 77% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the U.S. In the U.S., we reached 45% penetration. One highlight from the first-quarter is that Lowe's has enabled tap to pay acceptance. We believe the tapping provides the best buyer and seller experience in the face-to-face environment and we've seen that play-out in the results. In a recent Visa study in the U.S., we saw on average two more transactions a month and spend lift of $70 a month for those who tap with a Visa debit card versus those who don't tap. Now on to some noteworthy updates from the quarter, which demonstrate our ability to deepen and expand partnerships as well as create new ones. In Europe, we renewed our agreement with isbank, the largest private bank in Turkey with 33 million cards for its consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. As part of that renewal, they will be issuing the first Olympic and Paralympic Games credit card in Europe outside of France, leveraging our sponsorship. In Poland, we signed a new issuing agreement with PKO Bank Polski, the largest issuer and acquirer in Poland and Central Eastern Europe for consumer and commercial debit. In Greece, we expanded our partnership with Piraeus Bank, the largest bank in the country to become their exclusive payment network across their consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. These are all fantastic examples of the attractive position and strong pipeline in Continental Europe I spoke about last quarter. In Japan, we expanded our credit issuance partnership with e-Pass, one of the fastest-growing issuers in the country, affiliated with department store Marui. They will use Visa Managed Services, which is a part of our advisory solutions where we embed Visa employees within a client organization to help execute against key initiatives. In Korea, we renewed and expanded our partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in the country for a consumer and commercial credit and debit. Shinhan has also committed to utilizing a suite of Visa's value-added services, including consulting and marketing to advance their business. In Mexico, we renewed our agreement with BBVA across consumer and commercial credit and debit along with value-added services, including risk, advisory and data tools. And last, in the U.S., we extended our agreement with Bank of America for multiple value-added services, including visas loyalty platform service, CardinalCommerce 3D secure service, Verifi Order Insight digital service and DPS debit processing. We also continue to be a partner of choice for fintechs around the world. First, in the U.S., we renewed with leading fintech chime, further debit and credit builder secured card portfolios as well as for Visa Direct. In Latin-America, we renewed our debit and credit contracts with Rappi, one of the largest fintech and merchant clients in the region with more than 30 million customers. They will also utilize numerous value-added services, including CyberSource and Decision Manager. And finally, we are excited about a new global partnership with HSBC for their fintech initiative Zing. Starting with the U.K., we are supporting the ambition to launch this multi-currency proposition in more than 30 markets. Visa's capabilities through Tink, currency cloud and our consumer payment solutions offer a powerful customer proposition and rapid deployment for Zing and HSBC. Through these renewals and new partnerships, you can see how we are focused on building a deep relationship across all the capabilities Visa offers. Now moving to new flows. We have updated our sizing of the new flows opportunity using the latest market data available. Excluding Russia and China, we see $200 trillion of opportunity annually across B2B, B2C, P2P and G2C, certainly an enormous number. We are working with our clients to deliver Visa's commercial and money movement solutions to help digitize these flows on our network of networks. Starting with Visa Direct. Total transactions this quarter grew 20% to $2.2 billion. And on the P2P cross-border front, transactions grew more than 65% year-over-year. In terms of client highlights for this quarter, we have been developing partnerships for new use cases in verticals and we are continuing to drive cross-border volumes. First, in new use cases, in addition to our existing P2P partnership in the U.S., we have expanded our Visa Direct relationship with Meta, launching the ability for content creators on Meta's family of apps to cash out their earnings to a debit card. This launch, now live in the U.S., U.K., France and Italy, allows for creators to receive their payout quickly and safely. Second, on cross-border volumes, we have continued to make progress in enabling global money movement across our 8.5 billion endpoints in nearly 200 countries and territories. Western Union is a great example. We just signed a long-term global partnership agreement with Western Union covering issuance, Visa Direct and other services across 40 countries in five regions. This long-term collaboration will bring product innovations and digital-first customer experiences to enhance cross-border money movement. We also expanded our relationship with Remitly to enable customers from 30 countries to send cross-border payments to eligible debit cards and bank accounts in over 100 countries globally. In Canada, we recently announced our agreement with CIBC and Simplii to provide millions of clients the ability to send money to digital wallets in key remittance destinations including the Philippines, China and Bangladesh. On to the commercial side, total payments volume grew 8% in constant dollars. And throughout the quarter, we continued to focus on new verticals. Let me highlight a few specific areas. First, in the cross-border travel vertical, we recently expanded our agreement with Singapore based B2B platform Nium. Their virtual card B2B travel program will expand from the U.S. and Europe into Australia, Singapore, Hong-Kong and Japan. Also in B2B travel, we signed a new virtual card agreement with Worldline, a leading global payment provider for travel intermediaries to pay their suppliers more quickly. In the contractor vertical, we recently signed an agreement with United Overseas Bank and Doxa, a Singapore fintech for contractors. In partnership with Visa, the Doxa platform has further been enhanced to provide embedded financing capabilities. Subcontractors will be given the option to be paid for their services through UOB virtual cards. And also with UOB, we renewed and expanded our commercial relationship across commercial debit and credit including the enablement of payment flows for the Singapore government. Let me move on to value-added services. Our network of networks strategy is also playing a key role in value-added services. As a reminder, this has three components. One, moving money to all end-points and to all form factors. Two, using all available networks and being a single connection point for our partners. And three, providing our value-added services on all transactions, no matter the network. We have continued to develop and expand our value-added services as part of this strategy. Let me cover three recent examples. Processing capabilities for RTP networks, Pismo and Prosa. Last quarter, I noted that Visa is becoming a certified service provider for FedNow, enabling financial institutions to receive funds through the FedNow service. We have now enabled the ability to also send funds. The second example is Pismo, which we just closed last week. As I talk to clients around the world, particularly issuing clients, there are two priorities that are increasingly on the minds of CEOs. The first is for many of our issuing clients, they've either recently embarked on or they're considering embarking on a transformation of their tech-stack from their legacy infrastructure to cloud-native API-based tech stacks. The second is that many clients, whether they'd be traditional issuers or fintechs, are increasingly looking to rapidly expand their issuance to new regions and countries, especially the more developing markets around the world. Our clients are looking to Visa to help them with both of these priorities. And with Pismo, we will be able to deliver to our clients the best cloud-native issuer processor in core banking platform in the world. Pismo offers global core banking and multi-product issuer processing covering credit, debit and commercial with connectivity to local payment networks such as Pix. Our goal is for Pismo to be the platform of choice for our issuing partners around the world, enabling them to accelerate their global expansion and transition to cloud-native platforms. And the third example of our network of networks is our announcement to acquire a majority interest in Prosa, a payments processor in Mexico. A couple things about the Mexican market. One, cash and check represent more than 50% of personal consumption expenditures. And two, today Visa has limited ability to process domestically. We believe we can bring enhanced technology infrastructure and lay the groundwork to develop new innovative ways for consumers, small businesses and local issuers and acquirers in Mexico to pay and be paid. This includes improving safety, security and reliability and providing better experiences through our value-added services such as tokenization, risk products and more. We can also bring our innovation and commitment to continued investment for both face-to-face and online transactions. Together, these efforts will help further digitize payments in the country. The investment is subject to regulatory review and we hope to close in the second-half of calendar year 2024. And finally, I want to highlight the opportunities to drive further growth in value-added services via the development of new partnerships. These enable us to enhance our overall offering and distribution reach. Yesterday, we announced an agreement with digital workflow leader ServiceNow to build solutions and distribute Visa's products and solutions to joint customers. To start, ServiceNow will launch in end-to-end disputes management solution for issuers with plans to expand to additional segments and products over-time. This partnership showcases the demand for our value-added services and provides a compelling distribution channel to reach more customers around the globe. So, across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, you can see the enormous opportunity as well as Visa strong relationships, commitments to our clients and innovation in new ways to pay and be paid. What helps to amplify all of these efforts is our brand. We recently renewed our long-standing partnership with FIFA, creating a powerful opportunity to drive business for both Visa and our clients, improve brand lift and maximize global reach. Not to mention, providing an opportunity to showcase and implement Visa's innovative payment technology. We're also launching our first new global sports sponsorship in more than 15 years with the Red Bull Formula One teams. The partnership aligns our brand with two teams within Formula One which is one of the fastest-growing sports on the planet, providing another opportunity to drive business for our clients. As we look ahead this year, we're excited to be activating our brand with our clients across all of these partnerships as well as the Olympic and Paralympic games in Paris. Before I hand it over to Chris, I wanted to mention that we hold our Annual Meeting on Tuesday. All of the proposals that the Board recommended past including the exchange offer program proposal. As such, we will be moving promptly to file an S-4 with the SEC relating to the initial exchange offer. I also wanted to give a special thanks to my colleague, partner and friend, Alf Kelly, as Tuesday he officially retired as Executive Chairman. Alf, on behalf of the entire Visa family, thank you for your exceptional leadership. You led this business to incredible heights, while also driving innovation, deepening our client relationships and strengthening our culture in so many ways. Your impact on Visa will be visible for generations. In closing, in the first-quarter, Visa once again demonstrated the effective execution of our strategy across the globe. While uncertainty seems to be the norm, Visa has the experience and discipline to manage through the challenging environments and I remain optimistic and confident about our future. Now over to Chris.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q1 was a solid quarter with relative stable-growth in overall payments volume and processed transactions and strong growth in cross-border volume. Looking at our drivers, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year and processed transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Cross-border volume growth excluding intra-Europe was up 16% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal first-quarter net revenues were up 9% in nominal and constant dollars, which was on the high-end of our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives and less FX drag. GAAP EPS was up 20% and non-GAAP EPS was up 11% in nominal and 10% in constant dollars. Now on to the details, starting with the U.S. U.S. payment volumes grew 5% year-over-year, credit grew 6% and debit grew 5%. Card-present spend grew 3% and card not present volume grew 7%. As we look at the monthly total U.S. payments volume growth rates throughout the quarter, we saw low in October and a peak in November with December in between. Putting it all together, the step-down of about 80 basis-points in total US payments volume growth from Q4 to Q1 was primarily due to a less favorable mix of weekends and weekdays compared to last year and a combination of a few small items, including a softer October and modest impact from Reg II. Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments. Moving to holiday spend, which is the period from November 1 to December 31. In the US, consumer holiday spend growth was in the mid-single-digits on a year-over-year basis. Consumer retail spending growth was similar to last year. However, retail spending growth on key shopping days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday was much stronger. E-commerce increased its share of retail spending versus last year. Moving to international markets, where total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars, stable to Q4. Payments' volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions of Latin-America, CEMEA and Europe ex-U.K. each growing about 20% in constant dollars. Now on to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 16% year-over-year. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth excluding travel grew slightly faster-than-expected in the low-teens adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases. Cross-border travel-related spend grew 19% year-over-year. The cross-border travel volume index to 2019 increased from 139% in Q4 to 142% in Q1. Travel volume into Asia indexed at 132% of 2019 levels for the quarter, up three points from Q4, while travel volume out of Asia was up four points to 118%. This was lower than last quarter's expansion, primarily due to relative weakness in Australia and Japan. Travel in and out of Mainland China continued to improve, but both remain below 2019 levels. U.S. travel inbound continued to improve several points from Q4 versus 2019 levels. And we continued to see healthy travel volumes in and out of LAC, Europe and CEMEA and out-of-the US, ranging from 145% to 170% of 2019 levels. Now let's review our first-quarter financial results, starting with the revenue components. First, as any new pricing usually goes into effect in April and October, this quarter, each of our revenue components benefited as a result and the growth rates were either further enhanced or offset by the additional factors as follows. Service revenues grew 11% year-over-year versus the 9% growth in Q4 constant dollar payments volume with some additional help from card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 14% versus 9% processed transaction growth, helped by business mix and value-added services. International transaction revenues were up 8% versus the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping strong currency volatility from last year. Other revenues grew 18% with strong consulting revenue growth, but impacted by lapping 31% growth from 2023, primarily from FIFA related value-added services revenue. Client incentives grew 20%, but ended-up lower-than-expected due to client performance and deal timing. Across our three growth engines, consumer payments growth was driven by relative stability in payments volume growth and processed transactions as well as strong growth in cross-border volume. This quarter, in new flows, the underlying drivers remained relatively stable. Commercial volumes rose 8% year-over-year in constant dollars and Visa Direct transactions grew 20%. Total new flows revenue grew in the low-single-digits year-over-year in constant dollars due to several one-time items and business mix impact. As you know, for any given period, there can be puts and takes, but most importantly drivers are stable and we continue to expect full-year 2024 new flows revenue to grow faster than consumer payments revenue. In Q1, value-added services revenue grew 20% in constant dollars to $2.1 billion with strength and issuing and acceptance solutions. GAAP operating expenses declined 6%. The decrease in expenses was driven by a decrease in the litigation provision, somewhat offset by an increase in personnel expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 7%, primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses. Excluding net gains from our equity investments of $4 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $84 million. Our GAAP tax-rate was 19.1% and our non-GAAP was 19%, helped by larger-than-expected tax benefits. GAAP EPS was $2.39; non-GAAP EPS was $2.41, up 11% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 0.5 point benefit from exchange rates. In Q1, we bought back approximately $3.4 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of December, we had $26.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in January through to the 21st. U.S. payment volume was up 4% with debit up 3% and credit up 4% year-over-year, down from December, largely due to severe weather conditions in parts of the U.S. Process transactions grew 8% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 16% year-over-year. Travel-related cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, grew 16% year-over-year or 146% indexed to 2019; and cross-border card-not-present ex travel grew 16%. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollar and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. For the full year, we have no material changes to our prior outlook for drivers, adjusted net revenues or EPS growth. Remember that our drivers assume no recession or a further increase in Reg II impacts. Pismo is expected to have minimal benefit to full year net revenue growth and an approximately 0.5 point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense and EPS growth. FX is expected to have an approximately 0.5 point drag to net revenues growth and approximately 1 point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and a minimal drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. Non-GAAP non-operating income is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million, with nearly half in Q2 due to the resolution of some non-U.S. tax matters. Putting it all together, adjusted net revenues growth is unchanged at low-double-digits, adjusted operating expense growth is updated to low double digits, and adjusted EPS growth is unchanged at low-teens. For the second quarter, similar to the full-year, Pismo is expected to have a minimal benefit to net revenues growth and an approximately 0.5 point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense and EPS growth. FX is expected to have minimal drag to net revenues growth and an approximately 0.5 point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and minimal benefit to non-GAAP EPS growth. We expect adjusted net revenues growth in the upper mid to high-single-digits and adjusted operating expense growth in the low-double-digits, north of 10%. Nonoperating income is expected to be highest in Q2 due to the resolution of some tax matters, as I noted earlier. As such, the tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 16.5% in Q2 with the full-year unchanged. This puts second quarter adjusted EPS growth in the high-teens. In summary, we're off to a solid start in the first quarter. The fundamental drivers remain relatively stable, and with no material changes to our full year guidance, we remain focused on the execution of our growth strategy for the rest of 2024. As always, if the environment changes and there's an event that impacts our business, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans. We remain thoughtful on balancing between short- and long-term considerations. And now Jennifer, let's go to Q&A.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Chris, and with that, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks so much. Just want a clarification and a bigger question here. Just on the clarification, the new flows up low single digits versus mid-teens last quarter. How did that come in versus plan? Were there some onetime issues? Because it sounds like the other metrics were in line. And then my question was just on U.S. volume running in the mid-single-digits here, it's pretty tight to PCE. I know there are a lot of factors like gas and e-com and Reg II, but just can you clarify your view on U.S. volume here in relation to PCE growth in the short to mid-term? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Tien-Tsin, it's Ryan. Why don't I start on the second part of your question and then Chris can answer the first part and add or correct any on the second part. I think let's back way up for a second in the U.S. U.S. remains a significant opportunity for us in consumer payments. I mean, there's still a lot of cash, a lot of checks, a lot of ACH. We're having great work with fintechs and banks to bring more people in on the carded front. We're doing work to expand acceptance, the service industry, whether it's plumbers or contractors, charities, vending, parking, tap to pay. I mean, we continue to be very, very excited about the U.S. market. I think as you said, and Chris can add some detail, in the quarter, there's some Visa-specific factors on the growth rate in the U.S. as it relates to PCE, like you were talking about. But as we look forward, it continues to be a big opportunity for us. We continue to be excited about it. Chris, do you want to take the first part of Tien-Tsin's question and add anything on the second?\nChris Suh: Sure. Yes, in new flows, so the underlying fundamentals of our commercial business remain sound. Commercial payment volumes grew 8% and Visa Direct transactions grew 20%. And importantly, the new flows business continues to be a growth engine for Visa. We do expect the full-year revenue growth to exceed consumer revenue growth. Now specific to your question around the first quarter, it was impacted by a couple of factors: first, the mix of business, with cross-border volume growth slowing in Q1 as travel continued to normalize; and second, the growth was also impacted by a few onetime items that happened to be larger than we might typically see in any given quarter. But all in all, we feel great about the business and the long-term growth trajectory ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Cool, that's helpful. Thank you both.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question around the new partnerships within value-added services. Ryan, it sounds like, as part of the priorities, you want to get value-added services on all the networks. And I think you were alluding to the fact that this is going to be maybe a bigger shared responsibility with this partnership growth, and ServiceNow is obviously a great example. But I'm just trying to reconcile kind of how we should be thinking about Visa maybe opening up those opportunities with these two partnerships and what that may do at some point to the financial picture of the company? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. Again, if I back up before I answer to the specific question about ServiceNow and partners, we're very excited about the progress that we've made on our value-added services strategy. We're excited about the momentum that we're seeing kind of in the market. We're excited to see our sales efforts really driving success and performance across issuing, acceptance, risk and identity, advisory and open banking. And it's exactly as you were saying with partners like ServiceNow. What we're finding is we can have great efforts selling to our partners directly around the world. But we're also getting a lot of demand from various different platforms that already have relationship with thousands or tens of thousands or, in some cases, more customers in any one country or region. And they're very excited to sell through our value-added services as a way of differentiating their platform and deepening relationships with their users and their customers. And so in the example of ServiceNow, they had been talking to their bank clients, and their bank clients had asked for and been interested in some of the dispute services that we provide. And so we're going to market first, as I said in my prepared remarks, with our dispute services via ServiceNow. We've got a pipeline of other products and services that we're working with them on. And we're deep in discussions with other platforms around the world about bringing our money movement solutions and our value-added services solutions as a way to differentiate their platform and add value to their users.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Your line is open.\nJennifer Como: Craig, are you there?\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Sorry, can you hear me?\nJennifer Como: We sure can.\nCraig Maurer: Okay. Great. I wanted to ask if you can be a little bit more detailed in the comments around Reg II and how you're seeing volume move perhaps off your network. And second, if you can just add some detail around the onetime items that impacted Visa in the U.S. in the quarter, I'd appreciate it.\nRyan McInerney: So let me talk a little bit about the business aspect of Reg II, and then Chris, you can hit both of those specific questions, the Reg II and the onetime items. I think it's important at this point to just observe. We're 6 months in now since Reg II in the U.S. And we've had a chance to really engage with our clients and partners on the merchant side of what we do. And we're having really good discussions, really good dialogues. It's been a great opportunity for us to highlight our products, our services and especially the various different things that differentiate a Visa debit transaction from other alternatives. And to be honest, we're getting the chance to have conversations at more senior levels in the organization about the details of our products than we've ever had before, which is great. And so far, we're having great success. The sales conversations have been positive. The results client by client that we're finding as we're able to talk to them about the features and benefits of Visa Direct are great so far and feel really good about our results 6 months into this so far. So Chris, you want to hit the two pieces specifically?\nChris Suh: Yes, will do. So yes, on Reg II, so as we indicated, we did see some modest impact in the U.S. Payment volumes growth in the U.S. was down about 80 basis points from Q4 to Q1. And that slowdown was primarily due to a couple of things. One is the mix of spend days, but also there were a few smaller things, a softer October and the modest impact from Reg II that we're talking about. So a couple of things. It's important to note, we've actually not seen any meaningful changes to volumes being routed away since October. So all in all, the impact is modest, really hasn't changed over the past quarter, and that's actually what we have assumed and we shared for the rest of the year. Now to your second part of your question about one-time items, I talked a little bit about the things in the U.S., Reg II and the slow October. The other place where I talked about onetime items was in the new flows business. As I said, the revenue growth was impacted by a couple of things. One, I talked about the cross-border normalization as on travel. And then secondly, there were these one-time items, and I'll give you an example of one. In the normal course of our business, we regularly true up or true down our incentive and rebates with our clients based on their reported metrics. And in the first quarter, the net impact of these adjustments ended up being larger than we might typically see in a quarter. But all in all, it's not something that gives us concern. The underlying business fundamentals remain healthy. It doesn't change our expectations for full year growth for new flows revenue, which will continue to outpace consumer revenue.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks, good evening. I guess just a question on the slower volumes year-to-date, on the severe weather. I'm just curious if there's been any softness beyond that. And then maybe, do you expect that spending to sort of reaccelerate because the weather has gotten better? Or maybe you can just speak about that a little bit.\nChris Suh: Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. Yes, we did see that growth slowdown in the first week of January. And we've looked really closely at it, and it's directly correlated to the extreme cold weather that's hit in many parts of the U.S. I'll give you a few examples. For anyone in Kansas City, they know this. We went from 45 degrees in the last week of December to negative 10 in the first few weeks of January. And so no one was out and about, and we saw growth in Kansas City go from mid-single digits growing to declining mid-single digits. To take another example, in San Diego, those that are lucky enough to be there, 60 degrees, and we've seen stable mid-single-digit volume growth into January. And maybe a third example that highlights the swings that we saw, in Dallas, it was nearly 60 in the first two weeks of January and then dropped to below 20 degrees in the third week, and we saw the exact same pattern following with our card-present volumes in that third week. And so to the second part of your question, the good news is we've seen these type of weather-related patterns before. They tend to be short blips, and over the course of the quarter, tend to get smoothed back out.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nKen Suchoski: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the EPS growth outlook. It looks like you're guiding to high-teens EPS growth in fiscal 2Q, which I think implies a mid-single-digit decline in the share count quarter-over-quarter. But I'm just trying to figure out why that doesn't flow through to the full year EPS growth figure where you're guiding it to low-teens growth. So if you can help us reconcile that, that would be great. Maybe there's some tax, certain OpEx impacts in the back half of the year that we're not accounting for.\nChris Suh: Yes. It is specific to Q2. I think I mentioned on the call, there were some tax matters that were resolved outside of the U.S. that brought our tax rate down in Q2 into the 16% range. That same matter also had some benefit that hit the NOI line, which also then helped the high-teens growth rate on EPS in Q2 specifically. For the full-year, it doesn't change the tax rate. It doesn't change our prior outlook for EPS growth.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon. I want to follow-up on services. Given how increasingly important these are to your revenue growth, can you give us some insights, quantification on the composition of your value-added services, DPS, CyberSource, risk, et cetera? And maybe also expand about the growth drivers here with regards to attach rates, processing penetration, geo expansion. They're growing almost 2 times faster than your card volumes' overall services, so we are trying to just have a clear guidance here.\nRyan McInerney: Yes, thank you. As I was saying earlier, I think the strategy is really firing on all cylinders. Our execution is firing on all cylinders. The client demand remains strong. The TAMs are large, as you were saying. Last year, we generated about $7 billion in revenue in the value-added services business. I think we said in the quarter, it was a little more than $2 billion and up 20% in constant dollars. Those are great results. To get in a little bit into the details of your question, I mean, we run these businesses segment by segment. In issuing solutions, we're having great success with our network products around the world. DPS continues to have great success with clients in the U.S. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had renewed with Bank of America. That's one of our, as you might expect, largest clients in DPS, a fantastic partner, as well as a number of the other value-added services I mentioned. In the acceptance solutions business, CyberSource continues to have great success around the world, both with their omnichannel services as well as some of the value-added services they have, like token management service and the like. Our disputes business beyond just what I mentioned earlier around ServiceNow is having great success. Verifi is really firing on all cylinders, especially as it expands outside the U.S. Our risk and identity solutions business is really proving to be very resilient and high growth, both our Advanced Authorization Platform, Visa Risk Manager, Visa Secure, all the various different products that we've been bringing to market. And then our advisory services continue to do well. I mentioned in a few of the client wins in my prepared remarks, the success we've had with our managed services platforms where we're embedding teams of Visa employees in our clients, working shoulder to shoulder with our client partners day in and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out, helping them drive their business forward. I mean, that drives revenue growth. That diversifies our revenue. But more importantly than any of that, that embeds us in the building with our clients, helping them grow their businesses, makes our core business even more sticky. So yes, it's execution, it's product pipeline, it's delivery, and we feel really good about the results. Thanks for the question.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Just wanted to get a couple of clarifications. I think last quarter, Chris, you talked about growth would be at a low point in the first quarter, and then you would see that trough accelerate going forward. Just a nuance of the guide is mid to high single digits, so just trying to make sure if there was anything else new to report on Q2 versus Q1 being the trough. And then secondly, just a slightly higher operating expense in constant currency from, I think, it was high single to low double, just the low double now. Was there anything to factor in for that?\nChris Suh: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, so just backing up to your point, going into Q1, you outlined the guidance that I gave. We set an expectation at that time, similar language, high to mid-single digits to high -- sorry, mid- to high single digits, and we did come in at the high end of that range, which was, again, largely benefiting from timing of incentive performance. We have a similar expectation in terms of the range of growth in Q2, but many of the variables that I talked about in terms of the half one versus half two a quarter ago, which was lapping high volatility, lapping high cross-border performance from a year ago and lapping lower incentive growth from a year ago, those, we continue to believe, hold true. And we do anticipate that growth will accelerate into the second half of the year. In terms of your question on OpEx, yes, the changes that you picked up in terms of the full year guide primarily have to do with two things. One is we're now including the impact of the acquisition of Pismo into the guide for OpEx, and there's been some slight updates based on FX, the current FX rates.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. Ryan, I wanted to dig in a little bit on the impressive 17% merchant acceptance growth. It sounds like that really highlights the possibility or the opportunity for continued volume growth even in markets maybe where the secular growth rate is slowing a little bit. Is that sustainable? Should we continue to think about that kind of mid-teens acceptance growth as being a key driver of overall volume expansion?\nRyan McInerney: Listen, when I'm talking to our sales teams around the world, I'm pushing them for as much as possible and more. I mean, if you travel around the world, there are still hundreds of millions of small businesses that aren't on our network. And then you add to that, Andrew, you add to that kind of the creator economy and what's happening there. You literally can think about the acceptance opportunity in billions. So our sales teams around the world are out there working hard, getting creative, figuring out different ways around the world that we can serve those 100-plus million small and micro businesses and ultimately, 1 billion, 2 billion, 3-plus billion individuals around the world that all ultimately could become acceptors of our products as you think about things like Tap to Phone rolling out at scale. I mean, you can imagine a world where every handheld device becomes a tap acceptor, and every device is a tap to pay opportunity where we can not only penetrate further into the C2B space but the P2P space and others. So we felt really good, as you were alluding to, for the last -- I think the last several quarters, we've been 17%, 18%, 19% growth in acceptance locations. I tried, in my prepared remarks, just to give you a little bit of color of the type of things that we're out there doing with players like bKash and Caixa. And we'll be pushing hard to continue to light up all those other opportunities in emerging markets and developed markets around the world.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Thank you. I wanted to touch on the cross-border travel volume growth. It looks like it slowed from roughly 25% to maybe 16% to 17% in January. And back when you're kind of outlining your assumptions for fiscal '24, you thought it would be in the low-20%, and we see a 4 to 5 percentage point improvement compared to 2019. Just wondering how we should think about that as an assumption going forward. Do you think we'll bounce back to that low 20s? Or do you think something closer to where you've seen in January makes more sense? Now this is an area that sometimes you have at least some forward visibility, so trying to get a sense of where we should be thinking about that component?\nChris Suh: Yes. Great. Thanks, James. We had a really good quarter in Q1 to start the year on our cross-border business. Cross-border volumes, as you said, was up 16%. We feel great about that; and as you click into those, e-com growth in the low teens and 19% growth in travel, with the index going from 139% to 142%. And I'll just clarify one thing you said in terms of the guidance that we had provided into the low 20s, that was related to the travel portion of that, which came in at 19% or almost 20%. I do think when understanding the composition by region of our performance, and some of this is a little repetitious but I think important to go through, looking at it region by region is helpful. In LAC, CEMEA, Europe and U.S. outbound, strong results, indexing between 145% to 170% relative to the 2019 levels; second, U.S. inbound, which up until Q4 had lagged 2019, also continued to improve in Q1 and in line with our expectations; in AP, we did see continued expansion in and out of AP but a little bit slower than we saw in Q4, and that was specific to Australia and Japan. And it's probably also worth mentioning, well, not necessarily a large number, the war in the Middle East did have some impact on the cross-border numbers as well. But again, stepping back, we feel really good about our cross-border business in total. The Q1 results were strong, 16% growth; healthy growth for both travel and e-com. And we feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Hey, Ryan. Chris, Jen, how are you? I just want to drill down into sort of expectations or implied expectations for second half of fiscal '24 given Q1 results, upper single digits; Q2 expectations around growth, mid- to high single digits, so there's an acceleration that's implied. And the question is, what drives it?\nChris Suh: Yes. Thanks. I'm going to break that down into two questions because, one, you said how do we feel about the revenue guide and then I think the second question implied there was on drivers. And so let me talk to those because they are a little bit different. And maybe I'll even start with the second part first, which is with drivers. We're 1 quarter into the fiscal year. It was a solid quarter, stable trends from Q4. And importantly, the consumer has remained resilient. As we look into the rest of the year, we do anticipate drivers to continue to tick up slightly in the second half of the year for two reasons: one, average ticket sizes should improve, in particular, as we lap lower ticket sizes in the second half of last year in the U.S. and we see continued inflation in certain international regions; and second, we're continuing to execute against our growth initiatives in our global markets, for example, the processing wins that we've seen in LAC that we've shared progress about previously. So that's sort of the underlying drivers. And then your first question actually was on revenue. We had a solid start for the year, a really good Q1, stable Q4 trends. Today, we've reaffirmed our full year guide on net revenue in constant dollars, and that includes the modest impact of Reg II that we talked about. So we feel good about Q1. We feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year, and we'll continue to focus on execution.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig into Pismo a little bit. The website talks about large banks, marketplaces and fintechs. And you mentioned earlier the movement away from the legacy systems into more modern cores. I want to talk a little bit about the ambitions and the potential in terms of the bank sizing. And also, these core conversions, are they for new product and sort of sidecar cores, if you will? Or are we talking about the potential for your core kind of issuing clients in the U.S., midsized banks, to be moving their legacy core potentially over to something offered by Pismo in the future?\nRyan McInerney: So let me step back and talk a bit about how we found Pismo and then answer your question directly, Timothy. I mentioned in my prepared remarks these narratives and these priorities that we've been hearing from CEOs of banks all over the world, in the U.S. and all over the world, medium-sized, big-sized banks, which is, one, they're trying to make this transition from their legacy tech stacks to the cloud; and the second is they want to expand, especially in emerging markets where they don't have enough options of issuer processors to help them. That led us, hearing that over and over and over again, to go search the world for what we thought was the best cloud-based processor and core bank provider that we could find. And that led us to Pismo. And so while Pismo is based down in Brazil, their platform is global. Their clients today are a mix of some of the biggest and most sophisticated banks in the world as well as medium-sized banks and fintechs. So they already today have a mix of different client types. And our ambitions, our ambitions are what I said in my prepared remarks, which is we want this to be the preferred provider of banks around the world. You asked specifically about midsized banks in the U.S. for their core banking platform, the short answer is absolutely. As you think about large banks and their issuer processing capabilities not just for debit, which we have today in the U.S., but for debit, credit, prepaid, commercial, not just in the U.S. but globally, we think Pismo is absolutely a solution that our issuers could be using around the world. So yes, it is a global platform. We have global ambitions. Given the relationships that we have, the privileged relationships that we have with banks, big and small, in the U.S. and around the world, we feel good about our ability to distribute the product to them.\nJennifer Como: Last question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you. Just wanted to ask if we're still comfortable with low double-digit process volume and transaction growth for this year. I know both of those started off kind of in the high-single-digit range, ticked down a little bit in January. And also, any change in your thoughts around fiscal '24 incentive guidance? I think we were looking for modestly less dollar growth than in F '23, but you did a little better than expected in Q1. Thanks.\nChris Suh: Yes. Thanks, Jason. I think I answered some of the driver questions, but I'll just recap very quickly at a summary level. We're reaffirming the outlook for the full-year on drivers, second half benefiting from average ticket sizes in the U.S. and inflation in certain international regions and continuing to executing a number of our growth initiatives in global markets. Processing wins in LAC is the example that I used a minute ago. And so yes to your first question about reaffirming the guide on drivers. And then sorry, repeat your second question for me.\nJason Kupferberg: Just on the incentive guide.\nChris Suh: Incentives, yes. On incentives, yes, also no change in outlook for the full year. As you know, we manage the business to net revenue growth. That's where we're focused. We've updated our guidance for the full-year and Q2 on that. And we'll continue to, like I said, focus on execution.\nJennifer Como: Great. And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."}]}
