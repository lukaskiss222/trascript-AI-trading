Visa reported a slight decline in Q2 revenue and EPS, but demonstrated strong growth in payment volumes and provided optimistic guidance for Q3 with high teens revenue growth. Additionally, ongoing strategic initiatives in Visa Direct and value-added services, along with a significant share buyback program, suggest confidence in near-term performance. These factors are likely to support a positive short-term impact on the stock.
