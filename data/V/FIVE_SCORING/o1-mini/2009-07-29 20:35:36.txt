Visa Inc. demonstrated solid financial performance in Q3 2009, meeting and slightly surpassing expectations with a 14% increase in adjusted EPS and an updated revenue guidance for Q4 that suggests improved growth. Management's optimistic tone and strategic initiatives in the prepaid and international markets likely bolster investor confidence, outweighing concerns about U.S. payment volume declines.
