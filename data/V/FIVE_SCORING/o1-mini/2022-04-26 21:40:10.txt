Visa reported strong second-quarter results with a 25% year-over-year revenue increase and a 30% rise in non-GAAP EPS, reflecting robust growth across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services despite geopolitical challenges. The positive guidance for the full year and strategic acquisitions further support investor confidence, suggesting the stock may experience a positive short-term movement.
