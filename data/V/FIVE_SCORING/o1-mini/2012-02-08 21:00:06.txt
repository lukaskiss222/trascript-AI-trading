Visa reported strong first-quarter results with a 14% increase in revenue and a 16% rise in net income, driven by robust international growth and resilient U.S. credit performance despite challenges from debit regulation. The upward revision of revenue and EPS guidance, along with continued share repurchases, reflects management’s confidence and likely supports investor optimism. These factors are expected to positively influence Visa’s stock in the short term.
