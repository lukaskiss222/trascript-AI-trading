Visa reported strong second-quarter results with a 15% increase in net operating revenue and a 23% rise in net income, surpassing typical market expectations. Management's optimistic guidance for fiscal year 2011 and continued strategic initiatives, despite some regulatory concerns, reinforce positive investor sentiment. These factors are likely to support a short-term uptick in the stock price.
