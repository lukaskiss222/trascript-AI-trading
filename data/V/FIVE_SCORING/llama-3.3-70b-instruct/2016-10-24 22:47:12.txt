Visa's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company beating expectations on revenue and EPS growth. The integration of Visa Europe is proceeding well, and management expressed confidence in achieving synergies and growth opportunities. However, the company faces headwinds from a slowing global economy, Brexit uncertainty, and increasing competition in the payments space. Guidance for FY 2017 was provided, with net revenue growth expected in the high teens and mid-teens EPS growth. Given the mixed results and guidance, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term.
