Visa's Q1 fiscal 2011 earnings report exceeded expectations, with a 14% increase in net operating revenues and a 20% increase in diluted earnings per share. The company's growth was driven by strong performance in international markets, eCommerce, and mobile payments. Management expressed confidence in Visa's ability to navigate the regulatory environment, particularly with regards to the Durbin amendment, and announced a $1 billion share repurchase program. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Durbin amendment, Visa's solid results and growth prospects are likely to support the stock price in the short term.
