Visa's Q1 fiscal 2016 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with operating revenue growing 5% nominally or 8% on a constant currency basis, despite a negative three percentage point impact from foreign exchange. The company's performance was reasonably good, considering the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. However, the lowered guidance, delays in military contracts, and reduced body armor forecasts signal short-term headwinds. Management's focus on non-defense market growth, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions suggest long-term potential.
