Visa's earnings call revealed a solid fourth quarter and strong year-end to fiscal 2015, with 13% net operating revenue growth. The company's guidance for 2016 is cautious due to the strong dollar's impact on cross-border volumes and currency translation. However, Visa expects a step-up in payments volume growth, major new accounts, and good expense control, resulting in healthy core revenue and earnings growth in constant dollars. The acquisition of Visa Europe is expected to be accretive to earnings in fiscal year 2017, with cost savings of $200 million and potential revenue synergies. Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
