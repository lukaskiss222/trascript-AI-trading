Visa's Q3 earnings call revealed solid operational and financial performance despite economic challenges. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.98, positively impacted by the sale of its equity ownership in Visa Net Brazil, and achieved net operating revenues of over $1.6 billion, a modest increase over the year-ago period. Management expressed cautious optimism about the future, anticipating a slightly better fiscal fourth quarter with mid-single-digit revenue growth and confidence in achieving high-single-digit revenue growth for 2009. The stock is likely to react positively to the earnings call due to the company's resilience and growth potential.
