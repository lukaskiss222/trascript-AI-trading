Visa Inc.'s Q2 2013 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, driven by solid global payment volumes, data processing revenues, and international revenues. The company's guidance for fiscal 2013 was increased, with expected EPS growth of around 20%. The newly signed 10-year deal with Chase is expected to drive additional consumer credit and debit volume, although it may lead to margin compression. Management's tone was positive, emphasizing the company's commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders and its confidence in its business model.
