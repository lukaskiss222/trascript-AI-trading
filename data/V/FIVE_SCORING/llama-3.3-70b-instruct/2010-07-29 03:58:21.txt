Visa's Q3 earnings call revealed strong financial results, with a 23% increase in net operating revenues and a 45% increase in net income. The company's guidance for 2011 remains unchanged, with expected earnings per share growth of better than 20%. However, the pending implementation of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, specifically the Durbin amendment, poses uncertainties for the company's debit business. While management expressed confidence in Visa's ability to adapt to the new regulatory environment, the exact impact on the company's business remains unclear.
