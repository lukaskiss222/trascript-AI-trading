Visa Inc.'s Q3 earnings call highlighted the company's strong financial performance, with net operating revenues up 10% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS up 25%. Despite the positive results, management noted the impact of the Durbin regulation on U.S. debit volumes, which declined 9% in the quarter. However, Visa Debit, excluding Interlink, posted mid-single-digit payment volume growth. The company's international business continued to drive growth, with payment volumes in Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA, and Latin America increasing 13%, 8%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. Visa's guidance for 2012 EPS growth was revised to the low 20s, and the company authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. Overall, Visa's strong performance and strategic investments position it for long-term growth, despite short-term headwinds from regulatory changes.
