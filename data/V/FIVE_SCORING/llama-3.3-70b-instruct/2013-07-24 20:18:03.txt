Visa's Q3 earnings call revealed strong financial performance, with 17% net revenue growth and a raise in full-year 2013 revenue guidance to around 13%. The company's payment volume growth was broad-based globally, and it saw double-digit growth rates in the U.S. due to the lasting effects of U.S. debit regulations. Management's tone was optimistic, highlighting the company's ability to deliver strong results in the current economic environment. With a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized, Visa continues to demonstrate its commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.
