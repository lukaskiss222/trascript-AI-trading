Visa's Q1 earnings report showed solid revenue growth of 13%, driven by strong payment volume and cross-border volume growth, as well as higher-than-expected process transaction growth. The company's guidance for the year was reaffirmed, with a revenue growth target of 11-15% and earnings per share growth of over 20%. Management's tone was cautiously optimistic, citing ongoing economic uncertainty but highlighting the company's strong position in the secular shift to electronic payments.
