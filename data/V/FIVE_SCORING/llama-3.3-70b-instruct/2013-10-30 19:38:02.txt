Visa's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with 9% revenue growth and 20% EPS growth, driven by strong global payment volume and cross-border trends. However, the company faces headwinds from a strong US dollar, which is expected to result in a 2% drag on revenue growth in fiscal 2014. Despite this, management remains confident in the company's ability to deliver mid-to-high teens EPS growth, driven by its strategic initiatives and secular trends. The company's commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders, including a 21% dividend increase and a new $5 billion share repurchase program, is also a positive.
