Visa's Q3 earnings call revealed solid payment volume growth, with global payment volume growth in constant dollars at 11% and processed transactions up 11%. However, cross-border volume growth was soft, at 7% constant dollar growth, and revenue growth moderated due to FX headwinds and reduced currency volatility. The company narrowed its full-year guidance for client incentives and expects revenue growth in the 9-10% range on a constant dollar basis. Management remains bullish on the future, citing ongoing growth in digital commerce and new partnerships, but notes that headwinds are likely to persist in the near term.
