The earnings transcript of Visa Inc. indicates a solid performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2012, with net operating revenue increasing by 15% and 13%, respectively. The company's guidance for fiscal 2013 suggests low double-digit revenue growth and high teen adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. However, the management's tone is cautious due to uncertainties in the global economy and the impact of the U.S. debit regulation. The company's focus on innovation, particularly in the areas of digital wallets and mobile payments, is expected to drive growth in the long term. In the short term, the stock price may experience some pressure due to the tempered guidance and external uncertainties.
