Visa's Q2 earnings report showed strong financial performance, with net operating revenues increasing 15% year-over-year and adjusted net income up 23%. The company's guidance for fiscal 2012 was upgraded, with EPS growth expected in the high teens to low 20s range. Despite regulatory headwinds in the US debit market, Visa's diversified business and growth in international markets are expected to drive long-term growth. The company's investments in innovation, such as its V.me digital wallet service, are also expected to contribute to future growth.
