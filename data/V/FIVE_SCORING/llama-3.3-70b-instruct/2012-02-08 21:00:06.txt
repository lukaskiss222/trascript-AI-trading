Visa's Q1 earnings call revealed a strong performance, with net operating revenues up 14% year-over-year and net income increasing 16%. The company's financial results were driven by robust growth in international businesses, continued resilience in U.S. credit, and sustained cross-border spending. Despite some concerns about the implementation of debit regulation in the U.S., management expressed confidence in their ability to navigate the complex environment and raised guidance for FY '12 revenue growth to low double-digit growth and adjusted diluted EPS growth to high teens. The company's investment in innovation, such as V.me and mobile payment solutions, is expected to drive long-term growth.
