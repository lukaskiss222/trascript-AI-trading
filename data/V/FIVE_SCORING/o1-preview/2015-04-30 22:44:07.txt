Visa Inc. reported solid fiscal Q2 2015 results, exceeding revenue expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance despite currency headwinds. Significant client wins like the Costco co-brand partnership and continued progress in digital initiatives such as Visa Checkout highlight growth opportunities. While management expressed caution due to economic uncertainties and anticipates lower revenue growth in Q3, the overall positive developments are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
