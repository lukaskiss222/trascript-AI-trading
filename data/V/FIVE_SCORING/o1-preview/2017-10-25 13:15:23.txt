Visa Inc. delivered strong financial results, exceeding expectations with double-digit revenue and EPS growth, and provided an optimistic outlook for fiscal 2018. The successful integration of Visa Europe, robust cross-border growth, and strategic partnerships position the company well for continued success. Management's positive tone and plans to return significant capital to shareholders are likely to drive a rally in the stock price in the short term.
