Visa Inc. reported strong fiscal Q1 earnings, surpassing expectations with a 17% increase in net operating revenues and reaffirming its 2009 EPS growth guidance of over 20%. Despite acknowledging a slowdown in payment volume growth due to global economic challenges, Visa is effectively managing expenses and continues to see growth in transaction volumes, especially in debit usage. This solid financial performance and proactive cost management are likely to positively influence the stock price in the short term.
