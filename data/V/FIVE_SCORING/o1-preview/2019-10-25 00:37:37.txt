Visa reported strong Q4 and full-year results, demonstrating significant growth in net revenue and non-GAAP EPS. The company's positive outlook is supported by strategic partnerships, increased dividends, share buybacks, and expansions in new payment flows and value-added services. Despite higher client incentives and expense growth due to renewal activity and acquisitions, the overall tone is confident, suggesting a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
