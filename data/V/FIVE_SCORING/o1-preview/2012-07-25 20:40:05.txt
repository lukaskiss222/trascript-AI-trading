Visa Inc. reported strong financial results with double-digit increases in net operating revenue and adjusted EPS, along with an increased EPS growth guidance to low 20s. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program and progress in resolving a long-standing merchant litigation, which should remove legal uncertainties. These positive developments are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.
