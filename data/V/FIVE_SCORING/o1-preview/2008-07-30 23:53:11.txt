Visa reported strong financial results, including a 40% increase in adjusted net income and an 18% rise in net operating revenues. The company raised its operating margin guidance to the mid to high 40% range, demonstrating confidence in its ability to manage expenses and drive growth despite economic headwinds. While acknowledging some moderation in U.S. payment volumes, Visa's overall performance and optimistic outlook suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock.
