Visa Inc. reported strong fiscal third-quarter results, exceeding revenue and EPS expectations with net revenue growth of over 11% and adjusted EPS up 14%. The acceleration in key business drivers, including payments volume, processed transactions, and cross-border volume, alongside optimistic guidance and strategic acquisitions like Earthport and partnerships such as the extension with JPMorgan Chase, indicate positive momentum.
