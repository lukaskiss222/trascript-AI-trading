Visa reported strong earnings with a 26% growth in adjusted EPS, driven by healthy global economic conditions and benefits from U.S. tax reform. The company increased its dividend, authorized a substantial share repurchase program, and expressed confidence in sustained growth through strategic investments. These positive results and shareholder-friendly actions are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.
