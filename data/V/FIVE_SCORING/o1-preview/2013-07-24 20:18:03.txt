Visa Inc.'s Q3 earnings call highlighted strong performance, with net revenue growing 17% year-over-year and raised full-year revenue and EPS guidance. The management's positive outlook, broad-based growth, and announcement of a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program are likely to boost investor confidence. Despite some regulatory concerns in Europe, the short-term impact on the stock should be positive.
