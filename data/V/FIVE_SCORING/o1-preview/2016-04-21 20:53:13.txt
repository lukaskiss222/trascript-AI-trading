Visa's earnings call revealed a downward revision of revenue guidance due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges such as weak cross-border volumes, low oil prices, and the strong U.S. dollar. Delays in closing the Visa Europe acquisition, combined with continued interest expenses without offsetting income, further dampen the near-term outlook. These factors are likely to negatively affect investor sentiment, leading to short-term pressure on the stock price.
