The transcript for Visa Inc.'s Fiscal Q3 2011 earnings call presents several key points that indicate a strong financial position and strategic adaptability, but also highlights some challenges and uncertainties, particularly in the U.S. debit market due to regulatory changes.

### Key Points:
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Visa reported a 14% increase in net revenues, driven by double-digit payment volume growth, strong cross-border activity, and continued recovery in credit spend worldwide.
- **Regulatory Adaptation**: The company is adapting to the new regulatory environment in the U.S., specifically the Durbin Amendment, by modifying its pricing structure to include a new fixed acquirer fee and reduced variable processing fees. This is intended to help Visa maintain debit volume and compete for routing decisions.
- **Global Growth**: International markets are a significant contributor to Visa's growth, with a 17% increase in payment volume outside the U.S., accounting for 44% of Visa's total revenue.
- **Innovation and Expansion**: Visa is investing in new technologies such as mobile payments, e-commerce solutions, and developer platforms, which are expected to drive future growth.
- **Share Repurchases**: The company announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program, indicating a commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.

### Short-Term Implications:
- **Positive Financials**: The strong revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share increase of 29% over the prior year are likely to be viewed positively by investors.
- **Regulatory Challenges**: The impact of the Durbin Amendment, although managed with new pricing strategies, introduces some uncertainty and potential for competition in the debit market.
- **Global Growth Momentum**: The significant growth in international markets is a positive indicator for the company's future performance.

Given these points, the short-term impact on Visa's stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong financial performance, global growth momentum, and proactive strategies to address regulatory changes. However, the potential for increased competition in the debit market and some uncertainty around the full impact of the Durbin Amendment might temper the positive impact slightly.
