The earnings transcript for Visa Inc.'s fiscal second quarter 2017 indicates several positive and some nuanced factors that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Visa reported a 23% increase in net revenue and a 27% increase in adjusted EPS, exceeding expectations. This strong performance is driven by robust payment volume growth, cross-border business, and healthy operating metrics.
- **Client Renewals and Partnerships**: Notable client renewals and new partnerships, such as those with PNC Financial Services Group, ANZ Bank, and PayPal, contribute to the company's growth and stability.
- **Global Expansion**: Visa is making progress in key markets like Russia, Japan, India, and Europe, with significant growth potential, especially in digital payments and contactless transactions.
- **Tax Benefits and Share Buybacks**: The reorganization of Visa Europe led to a lower tax rate and a significant return of cash from foreign subsidiaries, which will help in share buybacks and reduce the need for debt issuance.

### Neutral to Negative Factors
- **Client Incentives Timing**: The delay in client incentives to the second half of the year could lead to higher client incentive expenses later in the year, which might slightly impact margins.
- **Regulatory Uncertainties**: There are ongoing regulatory challenges, particularly in Europe with PSD2 regulations and in India with evolving payment system guidelines, which could introduce some uncertainty.
- **China Market Challenges**: The phase-out of dual-branded cards in China is expected to impact payment volumes and revenues, although efforts are being made to transition to single-currency cards.

Given these factors, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, with strong financial performance, solid client relationships, and ongoing expansion efforts. However, there are some short-term adjustments and regulatory uncertainties that might slightly temper the optimism.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings report and the company's sustained growth momentum.
