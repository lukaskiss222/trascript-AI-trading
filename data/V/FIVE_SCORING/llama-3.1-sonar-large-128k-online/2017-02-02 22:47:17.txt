Visa Inc.'s fiscal first quarter 2017 earnings call highlighted several positive and some challenging aspects that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Business Fundamentals**: Visa reported a 25% increase in net revenue and a 23% increase in adjusted EPS, exceeding internal expectations. This was driven by accelerated payment volume growth, strong cross-border activity, and higher transaction growth[1][4].
- **Global Growth**: The company saw significant growth in various regions, including a 70.5% increase in international payment volumes in constant dollars, and a notable increase in payments volume in India due to government initiatives[1][4].
- **Strategic Initiatives**: Visa is making progress in its strategic pillars, including expanding access to its network, deepening partnerships, and driving digital expansion. The integration of Visa Europe is also on track, despite some delays[1].

### Challenging Factors
- **Exchange Rate Headwinds**: The strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the weakening of the euro negatively impacted both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 3 percentage points. This currency impact is expected to continue as a headwind[1][4].
- **Client Incentives**: While client incentives were lower than expected in the first quarter due to delayed deals, they are expected to increase in the second quarter, which could affect short-term EPS[1][4].

### Conclusion
Given the strong business fundamentals and the company's ability to offset some of the exchange rate headwinds, the overall outlook for Visa remains positive. However, the immediate short-term impact might be slightly muted due to the expected increase in client incentives and ongoing currency challenges.
