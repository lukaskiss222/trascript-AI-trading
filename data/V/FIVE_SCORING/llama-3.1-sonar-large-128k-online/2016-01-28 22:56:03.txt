Visa Inc.'s Q1 2016 earnings call highlights several key points that impact the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Revenue Growth and Macro Headwinds**: Despite a 5% nominal and 8% constant currency revenue growth, the company faces significant headwinds from a strong U.S. dollar, reduced cross-border volume, and economic weakness in international markets, particularly in Brazil, Russia, the Middle East, and China. These factors are expected to continue pressuring revenue growth in the short term[6%.

2. **Cost Management**: Visa has successfully managed costs, with expense growth limited to 2% in the quarter, and plans to continue prioritizing and phasing spending to ensure critical initiatives are funded while moderating expense growth.

3. **Visa Europe Acquisition**: The acquisition is on track, but its financial impact is not yet included in the current guidance. Regulatory approvals are pending, and the transaction is expected to close in the second calendar quarter.

4. **Digital Payments and Client Activity**: Visa continues to see strong growth in digital payments, with notable advancements in Visa Checkout and new partnerships, which are positive long-term indicators.

5. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company has maintained its fiscal 2016 revenue growth guidance but acknowledged that the lower end of the guidance range might be more likely due to ongoing macroeconomic pressures. There is a cautious tone regarding the global volume outlook, especially concerning cross-border transactions.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and the cautious outlook on revenue growth, despite the company's strong cost management and positive long-term fundamentals.
