Visa Inc.'s Q4 2011 earnings call presented several key points that indicate a strong performance and positive outlook, despite some challenges and uncertainties.

### Key Points:
1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Visa reported a 13% increase in net operating revenues for the fourth quarter and a 14% increase for the full fiscal year, driven by strong payments volume growth, cross-border activity, and recovery in credit spend.
