The transcript of Visa Inc.’s Fiscal Q1 2015 earnings call provides several key points that can influence the short-term outlook for the company's stock.

### Key Points:
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Despite headwinds from a strong U.S. dollar and lower gas prices, Visa reported solid financial results, including a 7% increase in net operating revenue and a 15% growth in EPS.
- **Foreign Exchange Impact**: The strengthening U.S. dollar is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 50 basis points for the full year, but the company is maintaining its guidance for low double-digit constant dollar growth.
- **Cross-Border Volumes**: Cross-border volumes softened due to geopolitical tensions and a strong U.S. dollar, but currency volatility has partially offset these headwinds.
- **Client Incentives and Expenses**: Client incentives are expected to run at higher levels in Q2-Q4, and the company is managing expenses judiciously while continuing to invest in long-term initiatives.
- **Tokenization and Digital Payments**: Visa is making significant progress in tokenization and digital payments, including Apple Pay and Visa Checkout, which are expected to drive future growth.
- **Stock Split and Share Repurchases**: The announcement of a four-for-one stock split and ongoing share repurchases indicate confidence in the company’s future and a commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.

### Conclusion:
Given the strong financial performance, continued investment in growth initiatives, and the positive outlook despite some short-term headwinds, Visa's stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term. However, the immediate impact of the strong dollar and softer cross-border volumes might temper some of the enthusiasm.
