The Visa Inc. Q2 2014 earnings call presented a mixed outlook with several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

## Revenue Growth
- Revenue growth moderated to 7% nominally and 9% on a constant dollar basis, largely due to foreign exchange headwinds and tough comparisons from the prior year. The guidance for full-year revenue growth was revised downward to 10-11% constant dollar growth, which is slightly below previous expectations[4].

## Cross-Border Volume
- Cross-border volume growth decelerated, particularly in specific corridors such as Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and Russia, due to economic and geopolitical factors. However, management expects this weakness to be temporary and anticipates a rebound in the future[4].

## Expenses and Margins
- Operating expenses were up 2%, but the company raised its operating margin guidance to the low to mid-60s due to various cost management initiatives and tax benefits[4].

## Russia and Regulatory Issues
- The situation in Russia, including U.S. sanctions and potential changes to Russian payment laws, introduces uncertainty but is not expected to have a significant long-term impact on Visa's global operations. However, this could weigh on the stock in the short term[4].

## Tax Benefits and Share Repurchases
- The company benefited from tax reductions and continues to repurchase shares aggressively, which could support the stock price[4].

Given these factors, the short-term impact on Visa's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The moderation in revenue growth and cross-border volume weakness are offset by strong underlying payment volume trends, improved margins, and ongoing share repurchases.
