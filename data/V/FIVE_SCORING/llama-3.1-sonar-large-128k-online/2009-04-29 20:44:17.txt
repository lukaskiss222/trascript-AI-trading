Visa Inc.'s fiscal second quarter 2009 earnings call presented several key points that are relevant for assessing the short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Despite the challenging global economy, Visa reported strong operational and financial results, including a 13% increase in operating net revenues and a 38% increase in adjusted net income compared to the year-ago period[4].
- **Resilient Business Model**: The company highlighted the resilience of its business, driven by the secular shift from cash and checks to electronic payments, particularly in debit transactions. Debit volumes in the U.S. continued to grow, even in a tough economic environment[4].
- **Guidance and Outlook**: Visa maintained its guidance for high single-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2009 and expected earnings per share growth of greater than 20%. For fiscal 2010, the company remained cautiously optimistic about regaining its 11-15% revenue growth target, assuming some recovery in the U.S. economy and cross-border volumes[4].
- **Expense Management and Margin Improvement**: The company reported an adjusted operating margin of 55%, exceeding its guidance, and announced an upward revision of its full-year margin guidance to the low 50% range. This was achieved through merger-related cost efficiencies and prudent funding of growth initiatives[4].
- **Challenges and Headwinds**: The call acknowledged challenges such as declining payment volume growth in the U.S., negative cross-border volume growth, and foreign exchange headwinds, which are expected to impact revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2009. However, these challenges were seen as temporary and manageable[4].

Given these points:

- The strong financial performance and resilient business model are positive indicators.
- The company's ability to manage expenses and improve margins is a significant strength.
- Despite short-term challenges, the guidance and outlook for both fiscal 2009 and 2010 remain positive.

### Conclusion

The overall tone of the earnings call suggests that Visa Inc. is well-positioned to navigate current economic challenges and emerge stronger. The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the company's strong financial results, improved margins, and optimistic guidance.
