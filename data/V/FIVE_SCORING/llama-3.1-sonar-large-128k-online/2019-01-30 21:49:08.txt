Visa Inc.'s fiscal first quarter 2019 earnings call highlighted several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Despite geopolitical uncertainties, Visa reported strong financial results with 13% revenue growth and 21% EPS growth. This suggests a robust underlying business[6.).

2. **Cross-Border Slowdown**: There was a notable slowdown in cross-border volumes, particularly in the latter part of the quarter and into January, driven by exchange rate fluctuations, Brexit uncertainties, and other geopolitical factors. This slowdown could continue to affect the stock if it persists.

3. **Guidance and Outlook**: Visa maintained its full-year outlook but cautioned that the second quarter might see lower net revenue growth due to various factors, including exchange rate impacts and delayed client incentives. This caution could introduce some near-term volatility.

4. **Investments and Partnerships**: The company emphasized its ongoing investments in new technologies, partnerships, and geographic expansions, which are positive for long-term growth but may not immediately mitigate short-term concerns.

Given these points:

- The strong financial performance and solid underlying business drivers are positives.
- However, the cross-border slowdown and cautious outlook for the second quarter introduce some uncertainty.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the current geopolitical uncertainties and the slowdown in cross-border volumes, despite the strong financial performance.
