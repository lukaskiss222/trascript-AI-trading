Visa's Q1 2020 earnings report and the subsequent discussion during the earnings call present several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Visa reported a strong start to fiscal 2020, with net revenue growth of 10% and EPS growth of 12%, which met or exceeded analyst expectations. This solid performance is likely to be positively received by investors[1].

2. **Guidance and Outlook**: Despite some drag from currency volatility and exchange rates, Visa maintained its outlook for low-double digit net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth for fiscal 2020. However, the company noted potential impacts from the coronavirus outbreak, which could introduce some uncertainty[1].

3. **Business Growth Drivers**: The company saw robust growth in key metrics such as payments volume (8% globally), cross-border volume (9% on a constant-dollar basis), and processed transactions (11%). These trends, along with expansion in emerging markets and new partnerships, indicate a strong underlying business[1].

4. **Client Renewals and Incentives**: Visa is experiencing higher-than-expected client renewal activity, which could impact client incentives but is generally seen as positive for long-term relationships and revenue growth.

5. **External Factors**: The ongoing coronavirus outbreak and its potential impact on cross-border transactions, particularly from China, introduces a degree of uncertainty that could affect short-term performance.

Given these points, the short-term impact on Visa's stock is likely to be positive due to the strong financial performance, robust growth drivers, and maintained guidance despite some external uncertainties.
