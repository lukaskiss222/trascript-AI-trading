The transcript for Visa Inc.'s Fiscal Third Quarter 2014 earnings call reveals several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue Growth and Guidance**: Visa reported a 5% nominal and 7% constant dollar revenue growth, which is somewhat moderated due to foreign exchange headwinds and lower cross-border volume growth. The company narrowed its full-year revenue growth guidance to 9-10% on a constant dollar basis, translating to 7-8% nominally due to FX impacts. This guidance adjustment might be seen as slightly negative by investors[1][2].

2. **Cross-Border Volume**: Cross-border volume growth was soft, at 7% on a constant dollar basis, which is a decline from the previous quarter. This slowdown is attributed to various geopolitical tensions and economic conditions in regions like Russia, Ukraine, and Latin America. This ongoing challenge could continue to impact short-term revenue growth[1][2].

3. **Operating Expenses and Margins**: Total operating expenses decreased by 3%, and the operating margin remained in the low to mid 60s. While cost management is positive, the overall revenue growth headwinds might overshadow this[1].

4. **Client Incentives and EPS Guidance**: Client incentives are expected to be around 17% of gross revenue, and EPS growth is guided at 17.5-18.5% for the fiscal year. These metrics are generally positive but may not fully offset the concerns around revenue growth[1].

5. **Digital Initiatives**: Visa is investing heavily in digital payment technologies, including Visa Checkout, tokenization, and new partnerships. While these initiatives are promising for long-term growth, they may not have an immediate impact on the stock price in the next 1-2 weeks[1].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the tempered revenue guidance, ongoing challenges in cross-border transactions, and the moderate impact of cost-saving measures. However, the long-term outlook remains positive due to healthy payment volume growth and innovative digital initiatives.
