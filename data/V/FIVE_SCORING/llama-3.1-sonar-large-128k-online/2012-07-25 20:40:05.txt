The Visa Inc. Q3 2012 earnings transcript presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the company. Here are the key points influencing the short-term stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Visa reported a 10% increase in net operating revenues and a 25% increase in adjusted diluted EPS, indicating robust financial health[6').
2. **Durbin Regulation Impact**: While the Durbin regulations have negatively impacted U.S. debit volumes, Visa has seen sequential improvement and expects this trend to continue. However, there will be a permanent reduction in debit card volume[6').
3. **International Growth**: Visa's international business, particularly in regions like Asia Pacific, Latin America, and CEMEA, continues to show strong growth, with payment volumes increasing significantly[6').
4. **Litigation Settlement**: The proposed settlement with merchants has been reached, which could help in resolving long-standing disputes and potentially improve relations with the merchant community. However, some merchants have expressed dissatisfaction and may opt out, but this is expected to be managed effectively[6').
5. **Investments and Innovations**: Visa is investing in next-generation payment technologies, such as V.me and mobile payments, which are expected to drive growth and enhance the payment experience[6'].
6. **Share Repurchase Program**: The company has authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program, indicating confidence in returning excess cash to shareholders[6'].

Given these factors, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, with strong financial performance, ongoing international growth, and strategic investments. However, the short-term impact of the Durbin regulations and potential litigation outcomes need to be considered.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial results, international growth, and the resolution of the litigation settlement, despite some ongoing challenges.
