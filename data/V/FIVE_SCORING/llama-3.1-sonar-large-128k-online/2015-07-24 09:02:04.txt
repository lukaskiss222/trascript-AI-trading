Visa Inc.'s Q3 2015 earnings transcript indicates several positive and negative factors that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Revenue Growth**: Visa reported a 12% year-over-year increase in net operating revenue, driven by solid results across all revenue line items, including service, data processing, and international transaction revenues.
- **Tax Benefit**: The company recognized a $280 million tax benefit, which shifted $0.12 of EPS into the third quarter, contributing to higher-than-expected earnings.
- **Client Partnerships**: Visa renewed several significant co-brand partnerships, such as those with Southwest Airlines, Avios, AAA, and Wyndham Rewards, indicating strong client relationships and ongoing business growth.
- **Innovation and Expansion**: The company continues to invest in digital payments solutions like Visa Checkout, token services, and partnerships with companies like FireEye to enhance payment security.

### Negative Factors:
- **FX Headwinds**: Foreign exchange rate headwinds continued to impact revenue, although currency volatility offset some of these effects in the quarter.
- **Client Incentives**: Lower-than-expected client incentive levels in the third quarter, with expectations of higher incentives in the fourth quarter, could impact margins.
- **Geographic Challenges**: Weakness in certain geographies, such as Brazil and Russia, and the impact of MERS on travel-related transactions, pose short-term challenges.
- **Restrictions on Buybacks**: Potential restrictions on stock buybacks due to ongoing discussions with Visa Europe could impact the stock price if buybacks are halted.

### Conclusion:
Given the strong revenue growth, positive adjustments in tax benefits, and ongoing innovation and client partnerships, these factors are likely to outweigh the short-term headwinds. However, the impact of foreign exchange and client incentives, as well as potential restrictions on buybacks, may introduce some volatility.
