Visa Inc.'s Q3 2010 earnings call presented several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the company's stock:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Visa reported a 23% increase in net operating revenues and a 45% increase in net income, exceeding guidance and indicating robust economic recovery and secular growth.
2. **Legislative Uncertainty**: The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, particularly the Durbin amendment, introduces uncertainty regarding debit services. However, management does not anticipate significant impact in FY '10 and only modest impact in FY '11.
3. **Global Growth and Diversification**: Visa's non-U.S. revenues are growing, and the company aims to generate half of its revenues from outside the U.S. by 2015. This global diversification is expected to support long-term growth.
4. **Innovation and Strategic Initiatives**: The acquisition of CyberSource and investments in mobile payments and other initiatives are positioned to drive future growth and expand Visa's capabilities.
5. **Share Repurchases and Capital Returns**: Visa continues to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which is generally positive for shareholder value.

Given these points:

- The strong financial performance and positive guidance for FY '10 and FY '11 are likely to support the stock price.
- The uncertainty around the Durbin amendment, although a concern, is not expected to significantly impact the company's performance in the short term.
- Global growth and diversification efforts further bolster the company's outlook.

**Conclusion:**
The overall positive tone of the earnings call, coupled with the company's strong financial performance and strategic initiatives, suggests a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
