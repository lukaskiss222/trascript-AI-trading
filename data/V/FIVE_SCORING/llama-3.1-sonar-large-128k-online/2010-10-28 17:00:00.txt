Visa Inc.'s Fiscal Q4 2010 earnings call presented several positive and some cautionary notes that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- Visa reported strong financial results, with a 13% increase in net operating revenues and a 35% increase in adjusted net income for the quarter, and a 23% increase in adjusted net income for the full year 2010[3].
- The company maintained its guidance for 11% to 15% net revenue growth and over 20% earnings per share growth for fiscal 2011, indicating continued confidence in its long-term prospects[3].
- Visa announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program and a 20% increase in the quarterly dividend, signaling a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders[3].
- The company highlighted significant growth in key areas such as international expansion, mobile payments, and e-commerce, particularly through the CyberSource acquisition[3].

### Cautionary Factors:
- The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Durbin amendment and its potential impact on Visa's U.S. debit business could introduce volatility. Although Visa has factored in some impact from the Durbin amendment into its guidance, the full extent of its effects is still unclear[3].
- The company noted that the comparisons for revenue growth will get tougher as the year progresses, which might affect the quarterly progression of revenues[3].

Given these factors, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, with strong financial performance, robust guidance, and significant investments in growth areas. However, the uncertainty around regulatory impacts, particularly from the Durbin amendment, introduces some caution.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial results, confident guidance, and shareholder-friendly actions, despite some regulatory uncertainties.
