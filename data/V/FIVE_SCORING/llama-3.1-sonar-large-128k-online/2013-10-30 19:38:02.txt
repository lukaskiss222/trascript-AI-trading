Visa Inc.'s Q4 2013 earnings call presented several key points that will likely influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue and EPS Growth**: Visa reported strong revenue growth of 9% and EPS growth of 20% for the quarter, aligning with guidance. However, the company noted a significant FX headwind, which is expected to continue into 2014, affecting revenue growth.

2. **Guidance for 2014**: The guidance for fiscal 2014 includes lower revenue growth expectations due to FX headwinds, but maintains mid to high-teens EPS growth. This mixed guidance might temper investor enthusiasm.

3. **Operational Efficiency and Cost Management**: Visa announced a restructuring reserve to streamline costs and align with strategic priorities, which could be seen positively in terms of long-term efficiency but may not have an immediate positive impact on the stock.

4. **Capital Return**: The company announced a significant share repurchase program and a 21% increase in the quarterly dividend, which is generally favorable for shareholders and could support the stock price.

5. **U.S. Spending Trends**: There was a noted softening in U.S. consumer spending, partly attributed to the government shutdown and lower gas prices, which could raise short-term concerns about economic recovery and its impact on Visa's growth.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly negative impact in the short term due to the mixed nature of the guidance and the ongoing FX headwinds, despite the positive long-term outlook and strong financial performance.

**Rating: -1**
