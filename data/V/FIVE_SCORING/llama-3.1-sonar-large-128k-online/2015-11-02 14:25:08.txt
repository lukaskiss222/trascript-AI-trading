The earnings call for Visa Inc. revealed several key points that will likely influence the stock's short-term performance:

### Strong Financial Performance
Visa reported solid Q4 and full-year 2015 results, with strong revenue and earnings growth, despite challenges from a strong U.S. dollar and lower oil prices.

### Visa Europe Acquisition
The acquisition of Visa Europe is a significant strategic move expected to bring substantial benefits, including cost savings, revenue growth, and enhanced digital capabilities. However, the transaction will result in short-term EPS dilution due to the issuance of debt and preferred stock.

### Guidance and Outlook
For fiscal 2016, Visa anticipates continued growth, though at a slower pace due to the strong U.S. dollar and higher client incentives. The company expects low single-digit percentage point EPS dilution in 2016 before one-time integration costs related to the Visa Europe acquisition.

### Capital Structure and Buybacks
Visa plans to issue $15 billion to $16 billion in debt to finance the acquisition and intends to step up stock buybacks to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred shares issued.

Given these points:

- The strong financial performance and positive long-term outlook will likely be overshadowed in the short term by the dilutive effects of the Visa Europe acquisition and the ongoing challenges from currency translation.
- The market may react cautiously to the immediate EPS dilution and the increased debt, despite the long-term benefits anticipated from the acquisition.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the immediate financial impacts of the acquisition, but the overall strong performance and positive long-term outlook should mitigate significant declines.
