The earnings transcript for Visa Inc. reveals several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Reduced Guidance**: Visa has reduced its revenue growth guidance for the fiscal year 2016 due to ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, including a strong dollar, low oil prices, and weakness in certain global economies. This reduction in guidance could lead to short-term disappointment among investors[5>.

2. **Cyclical Challenges**: The company emphasized that the current challenges are cyclical and not related to market share loss. However, the persistence of these cyclical issues, such as weak cross-border volumes and low gas prices, may continue to weigh on the stock in the near term[5].

3. **Expenses and Tax Rate**: Despite the revenue challenges, Visa is managing expenses effectively and anticipating a modestly lower tax rate, which could help mitigate some of the impact on net income. However, this may not be enough to offset the reduced revenue growth expectations[5].

4. **Visa Europe Acquisition**: The acquisition of Visa Europe, while expected to be accretive in the long term, introduces short-term complexities, including additional interest expenses without the immediate offset of operating income from Visa Europe. This could create some near-term drag on earnings[5%.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the reduced guidance, ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, and the immediate financial impacts of the Visa Europe acquisition.
