Visa Inc.'s Q3 2018 earnings call presented several positive indicators that suggest a strong short-term outlook for the company's stock. Here are the key points:

1. **Strong Revenue Growth**: Visa reported a 15% revenue growth, driven by robust payments volume and processed transactions growth. This momentum is expected to continue, with double-digit accretion from the Visa Europe acquisition ahead of schedule[2][5].

2. **Global Expansion and Innovation**: The company is making significant progress in various markets, including Europe, Asia, and Latin America, with initiatives such as Visa Direct, contactless payments, and partnerships with FinTechs. These efforts are likely to sustain high levels of secular growth[2][5].

3. **Positive Outlook**: The adjusted EPS growth of 39% and the increase in the EPS growth outlook for fiscal year 2018 to the low 30s are positive signs. Additionally, the company's tax rate benefits from U.S. tax reform and other non-recurring benefits will continue to support EPS growth[2][5].

4. **Share Buybacks and Dividends**: Visa returned $2.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which can support the stock price by reducing the number of outstanding shares and increasing earnings per share[2].

Given these positive factors, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.

**Rating: 1**
