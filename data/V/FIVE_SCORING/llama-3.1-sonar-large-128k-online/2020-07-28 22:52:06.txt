The earnings transcript for Visa Inc.'s Fiscal Third Quarter 2020 reveals several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue and EPS Decline**: Net revenues declined by 17% and non-GAAP EPS declined by 23% due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly impacting cross-border transactions and travel-related spending[2][5].

2. **Resilient Business Drivers**: Despite the decline, Visa saw growth in debit transactions, e-commerce volumes, Visa Direct transactions, tap-to-pay adoption, and value-added services revenue. These trends suggest resilience and potential for long-term growth[2][5].

3. **Cost Management and Investments**: Visa effectively managed expenses, reducing them by 5% while maintaining investments in key growth initiatives. This demonstrates financial discipline and a focus on future growth[2][5].

4. **Uncertainty and Recovery**: The recovery of cross-border transactions remains uncertain and highly dependent on the reopening of borders. However, domestic spending and e-commerce have shown robust recovery, which could offset some of the cross-border declines[2][5].

5. **Value-Added Services Growth**: Value-added services, such as issuer processing, CyberSource, and risk and fraud services, continue to grow and are expected to sustain their growth post-COVID, adding to Visa's diversified revenue streams[2][5].

Given these points, here are the implications for the stock:

- The immediate reaction might be negative due to the significant declines in revenue and EPS, as well as the uncertainty surrounding cross-border transaction recovery.
- However, the long-term growth prospects, resilience in key business drivers, and continued investment in growth initiatives could mitigate some of the short-term negativity.
- The strong performance in debit, e-commerce, and value-added services could provide a positive narrative for investors looking beyond the current quarter.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the reported declines and ongoing uncertainty but may stabilize or even see a slight rebound as investors focus on the company's resilient business model and long-term growth prospects.
