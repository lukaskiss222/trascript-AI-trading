The earnings transcript for Visa Inc. indicates several key points that will likely influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Visa reported solid fourth-quarter and full-year 2012 results, with net operating revenues increasing by 15% and adjusted diluted EPS rising by 21% for the quarter. Full-year adjusted net income and EPS also showed significant growth.

2. **Guidance and Outlook**: Despite the strong performance, Visa has set cautious guidance for 2013, projecting low-double-digit net revenue growth due to uncertainties in the global economy and the impact of U.S. debit regulations. However, adjusted diluted EPS growth is still expected in the high teens.

3. **Leadership Transition**: The transition to a new CEO, Charlie Scharf, was announced, which might introduce some short-term uncertainty but is generally viewed positively given Scharf's background and familiarity with Visa.

4. **Investment and Innovation**: Visa is investing heavily in new technologies such as V.me and mobile payments, which are expected to drive growth but may not yield immediate significant revenue. This long-term focus could temper short-term expectations.

5. **Share Buybacks and Dividend Increase**: The company announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program and a 50% dividend increase, which are positive for shareholder value but may not immediately impact the stock price unless combined with other positive factors.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive but not exceptionally strong reaction in the short term. The strong financial performance and positive outlook on EPS growth are balanced by cautious revenue guidance and the transitional period with the new CEO.
