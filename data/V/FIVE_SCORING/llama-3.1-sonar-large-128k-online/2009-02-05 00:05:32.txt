Visa Inc.'s Q1 2009 earnings call presents a mixed outlook that is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Earnings**: Despite solid Q1 results, with revenue and earnings exceeding expectations, the company has lowered its full-year revenue growth guidance to the high single digits, below the initial 11% to 15% range. This revision is due to slower payment volume growth and negative impacts from gas prices and foreign exchange rates[2）。
- **Economic Challenges**: The economic downturn is affecting payment volumes globally, especially in the US, where credit volume growth has turned negative and debit growth has slowed. Cross-border volumes have also been impacted, showing flat to negative growth[2].
- **Expense Management**: The company is reducing expenses, which should help maintain the 20% diluted earnings per share growth target for 2009. However, this cost-cutting does not indicate a significant boost to the stock in the short term[2].
- **Long-term Outlook**: Visa remains optimistic about long-term growth, particularly in international markets and emerging economies. However, this optimism does not immediately translate to short-term stock performance[2].

Given these factors, the short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the reduced revenue guidance and ongoing economic challenges.
