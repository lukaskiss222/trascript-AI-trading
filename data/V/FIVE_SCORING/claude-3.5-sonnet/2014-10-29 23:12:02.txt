Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess that Visa is well-positioned for positive short-term stock performance. Key positives include:

1. Strong underlying business metrics with double-digit payment volume growth and improving cross-border trends
2. Strategic pricing increases planned for April 2015 that will boost revenue growth
3. Momentum in digital initiatives like Visa Checkout and Apple Pay
4. Consistent capital return through increased dividend and $5B new share buyback

While there are some headwinds (FX, incentives timing), the company's core performance and growth initiatives point to upside potential in the next 1-2 weeks.
