Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact (1-2 weeks) on Visa's stock price. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong fundamentals despite headwinds:
- Revenue growth of 8% exceeded expectations
- Stable payment volumes (11% growth on constant currency)
- Strong new client wins (Costco, Best Buy, U.S. Bank renewal)

2. Management confidence and strategy:
- Reaffirmed full-year guidance
- Strong progress in digital initiatives (Visa Checkout)
- Disciplined approach to pricing and partnerships

3. Key positives outweigh negatives:
- Costco win is strategically significant
- Currency volatility helping offset FX translation impact
- Pipeline of new merchant solutions showing promise

While there are some challenges (Citi/Itau losses, FX headwinds), the overall tone is confident and results/guidance support continued growth.
