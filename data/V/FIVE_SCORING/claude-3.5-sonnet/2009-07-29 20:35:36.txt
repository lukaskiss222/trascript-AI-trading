Based on this earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Visa's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key supporting factors:

1. Strong quarterly results exceeding expectations, with adjusted EPS of $0.67 (14% YoY growth) and management raising Q4 revenue guidance from low-single digits to mid-single digits.

2. Successfully renewed major client contracts representing 26% of global volume, reducing business risk with no major renewals needed for next 2 years.

3. Management reaffirmed FY2010 targets and showed confidence in achieving 11-15% revenue growth despite economic headwinds, citing improving trends in transaction volumes and cross-border activity.

The positive guidance, strong execution on client renewals, and management's confident tone should drive favorable investor sentiment in the near term.
