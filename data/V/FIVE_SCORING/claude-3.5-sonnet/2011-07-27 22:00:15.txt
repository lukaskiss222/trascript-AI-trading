Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Visa's stock price. Key bullish factors include:

1. Strong financial performance with 14% revenue growth and 23% adjusted net income growth, beating expectations
2. Robust international growth with 17% payment volume growth outside the US, showing successful geographic diversification
3. Clear strategy to address Durbin regulation impacts while maintaining competitive position
4. Continued strength in credit spending and successful new partnerships (United Airlines, Disney)

While there are some headwinds from US debit regulation changes, management appears well-prepared with specific strategies to minimize impact. The company also demonstrated commitment to shareholder returns with a new $1B share repurchase program.
