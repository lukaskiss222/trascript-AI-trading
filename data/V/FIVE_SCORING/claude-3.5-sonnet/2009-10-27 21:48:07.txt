Based on the earnings call transcript, I believe Visa's stock will have a positive impact over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong financial performance with better-than-expected revenue growth and encouraging volume trends:
- Net operating revenues up 10% to $1.9B
- Payment volumes showing signs of improvement across regions
- Transaction growth accelerating to 9-10%

2. Positive forward guidance:
- Expects to achieve low end of 11-15% revenue growth target for 2010
- Projects >20% EPS growth for both 2010 and 2011
- Operating margins expected to improve to mid-50s range

3. Strong capital return to shareholders:
- Announced 19% dividend increase
- New $1B share buyback program
- Generated $3.3B in free cash flow

While there are some cost pressures and economic uncertainties, the overall tone was confident and the core metrics showed improvement. The guidance and capital return plans suggest management has strong visibility into continued growth.
