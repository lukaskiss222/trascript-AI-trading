Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock impact:

Key Positive Points:
- Strong credit volume growth (10% in US)
- Improving trajectory in debit volume post-Durbin implementation
- International growth remains robust across regions
- Reaffirmed FY13 guidance of high-teens EPS growth
- New $1B share buyback authorization

Key Concerns:
- Guidance narrowed to "low 20s" EPS growth from "high teens to low 20s"
- Higher incentives expected in FY13
- Some macro uncertainty in Europe, China, Brazil
- Permanent deterioration expected in US debit volumes

Overall Assessment:
While there are some minor concerns, the core business is performing well with strong credit growth offsetting debit headwinds. Management struck a confident tone on growth trajectory and capital return plans. The guidance adjustment was minor and international expansion continues. The merchant litigation settlement removes a major overhang.

Rating: [1]
The positives outweigh the negatives and removal of litigation uncertainty should drive modest upside in shares over the next 1-2 weeks.
