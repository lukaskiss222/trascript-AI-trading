Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly positive short-term impact on Visa's stock price for the following reasons:

1. Despite challenging macro conditions, management maintained their guidance for 20%+ EPS growth and operating margins in the mid-to-high 40% range for both 2009-2010, demonstrating resilience in their business model.

2. While U.S. credit volume has turned negative, debit volumes remain strong with double-digit growth, and international expansion continues with major wins like RBS and HSBC partnerships.

3. The company announced a $1.1B share repurchase program and showed strong cost control, which should support the stock.

However, some caution is warranted due to slowing cross-border volumes and management's expectation of potential single-digit revenue growth in the second half of 2009.
