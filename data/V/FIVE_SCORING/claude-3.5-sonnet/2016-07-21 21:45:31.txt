Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Visa's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. The strategic partnership with PayPal addresses a key competitive concern and opens up significant growth opportunities, with PayPal agreeing to promote Visa cards and not steer users to ACH.

2. The Visa Europe acquisition is progressing well with integration on track and management reaffirming expected accretion targets despite Brexit uncertainties.

3. Core business metrics remain stable with consistent volume growth and the company reaffirmed full-year guidance, while also noting potential acceleration in 2017 as headwinds ease.

The positive strategic moves and stable operational performance outweigh near-term challenges like Brexit uncertainty and global economic concerns.
