Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Visa's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. The company raised its FY2012 EPS guidance to high teens/low 20s growth and reaffirmed strong 2013 guidance, demonstrating confidence in their outlook despite regulatory headwinds.

2. Credit volume growth remains robust (11% in US), while the expected debit decline was already priced in and tracking slightly better than internal projections. International growth remains very strong at 21%.

3. Management demonstrated clear strategic execution with new partnerships, technology initiatives (V.me), and market share gains in key international markets like Brazil.

The main risk is regulatory uncertainty around the DOJ investigation, but management expressed confidence this won't materially impact guidance.
