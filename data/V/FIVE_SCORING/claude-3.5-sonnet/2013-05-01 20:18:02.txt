Based on this earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Visa's stock price. Key positives include:

1. Strong revenue growth of 15% and increased EPS guidance from high teens to around 20%
2. Successful management of U.S. debit business recovery post Dodd-Frank regulations
3. Strategic 10-year deal with Chase that appears value-accretive
4. Continued strength in global payment volumes and cross-border transactions
5. Aggressive return of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends

While there are some concerns around European regulatory investigations and merchant litigation, the core business fundamentals remain very strong with management demonstrating solid execution. The increased full-year guidance and positive volume trends through April suggest good momentum.
