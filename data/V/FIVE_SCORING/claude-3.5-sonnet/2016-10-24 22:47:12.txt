Based on the earnings call transcript, I would give a positive rating for Visa's short-term stock outlook. Key positives include:

1. Strong Q4 results that exceeded management's expectations, with 19% revenue growth and healthy payment volume trends
2. Recovery in cross-border volumes to double-digit growth levels for the first time since 2014
3. Successful integration of Visa Europe progressing well with major client renewals
4. Strong momentum in digital initiatives like Visa Checkout and tokenization

While there are some headwinds like higher incentive costs and European economic weakness, the overall tone was confident with mid-teens revenue and EPS growth guidance for FY2017. Management conveyed a clear strategy and strong execution despite CEO transition.
