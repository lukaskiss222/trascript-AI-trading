Based on analyzing the earnings call, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Visa's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong first quarter performance with revenue up 14% and EPS up 21%, beating expectations and leading to raised full-year guidance for both revenue and EPS growth.

2. International business continues robust growth (66% of revenue growth came from outside US) while US credit volumes remain resilient with 10% growth.

3. Management indicated that impacts from debit regulation (Durbin Amendment) are proving "modestly better than contemplated" and they have successfully implemented mitigation strategies.

While there are some headwinds from debit regulation changes and European uncertainty, the overall tone was confident and results/guidance were strong enough to likely drive positive sentiment in the near-term.
