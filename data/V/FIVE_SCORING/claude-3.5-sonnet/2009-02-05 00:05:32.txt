Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Visa's stock price for the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my analysis:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q1 results with revenue up 17% and adjusted net income up 35% YoY
- Reaffirmed 2009 EPS growth guidance of >20% despite revenue headwinds
- Healthy transaction growth of 8% showing continued cash-to-card conversion
- Effective cost management and margin control
- Strong debit performance and international growth opportunities
- Solid balance sheet with $5.6B in cash/investments

Modest Concerns:
- Revenue growth expected to slow to low single digits in 2H 2009
- Cross-border volumes turned negative in January
- Some pressure on credit volumes in US market

Overall, while there are some near-term revenue growth headwinds, Visa demonstrated strong execution, cost discipline, and ability to maintain profitability targets. The company's defensive business model and management's confident tone should support positive stock performance in the short term.
