Based on the earnings call transcript, Visa demonstrated strong resilience despite economic headwinds, with several key positives:

1. Solid financial performance with operating revenues up 13% YoY and adjusted operating margins reaching 55%
2. Strong debit performance offsetting credit weakness, with debit volumes remaining positive
3. Maintained full-year guidance for high single-digit revenue growth and >20% EPS growth
4. Increased operating margin guidance for both 2009 and 2010
5. Management expressed confidence in business model and ability to manage expenses

While near-term challenges exist (cross-border slowdown, FX headwinds), the company appears well-positioned to weather current conditions and accelerate growth when the economy improves. The positive tone and raised guidance suggests the stock should react favorably in the short term.
