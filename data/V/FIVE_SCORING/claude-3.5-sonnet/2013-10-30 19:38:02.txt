Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis:

Key Positives:
- Solid financial performance with 13% revenue growth and 20% EPS growth for FY2013
- Strong capital return program with $5B new share buyback and 21% dividend increase 
- Healthy global payment volume growth of 13%
- Renewed commitment to investing in growth initiatives and partnerships

Key Concerns:
- Slowdown in U.S. spending trends in September/October (8-9% vs 11% prior)
- FX headwinds expected to create 2% revenue drag in FY2014
- High client incentives (18.6% of gross revenue) due to heavy deal activity
- Slightly lowered revenue expectations vs previous guidance

The near-term outlook appears modestly positive. While there are some headwinds from U.S. consumer spending and FX, the core business remains strong with robust global growth, aggressive capital returns, and management's strategic focus on expanding partnerships and capabilities. The stock should see modest upside in coming weeks.
