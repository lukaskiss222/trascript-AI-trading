Based on the earnings call transcript, Visa delivered strong quarterly results and demonstrated robust global growth momentum, particularly in international markets. Key positives include:

1. Strong financial performance:
- Revenue up 14% to $2.2B
- Net income up 16% to $884M
- Operating margin at 61%

2. Healthy growth metrics:
- Global payment volume up 15%
- Cross-border volumes up 15%
- International revenue growth contributed 60% of total growth

3. Management appears confident in their ability to navigate regulatory challenges (Durbin Amendment) and is actively pursuing growth initiatives in mobile payments, ecommerce, and international markets.

The main risk factor is uncertainty around the impact of the Durbin Amendment debit regulations, but management expressed confidence in their ability to mitigate impacts through various strategies.

Given the strong results, continued growth momentum, and management's confident tone despite regulatory headwinds, I expect the stock to react positively in the near term.
