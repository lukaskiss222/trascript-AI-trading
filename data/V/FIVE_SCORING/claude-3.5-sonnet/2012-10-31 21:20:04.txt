Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Visa's likely 1-2 week stock impact:

Positive factors:
- Strong Q4 results with revenue up 15% and adjusted EPS up 21%
- Healthy credit volume growth, especially in US
- Solid execution on debit regulation mitigation strategies
- New $1.5B share buyback authorization and 50% dividend increase

Concerns:
- Conservative FY2013 guidance citing global economic uncertainties
- Moderating international payment volume growth
- CEO transition starting tomorrow adds some uncertainty
- Higher investment spending will limit margin expansion

The overall tone was cautiously optimistic but conservative looking forward. While Q4 results were strong, management's careful outlook and focus on economic headwinds suggests limited near-term upside. The CEO transition adds another variable. However, the strong fundamentals, capital return programs and proven business model should prevent material downside.
