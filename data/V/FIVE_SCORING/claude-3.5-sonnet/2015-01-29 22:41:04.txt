Based on the earnings call transcript, I am positive about Visa's short-term stock outlook. Key positives include:

1. Strong underlying payment volumes and transaction growth despite macro headwinds (11% global payment volume growth)
2. Effective management of expenses while continuing strategic investments
3. Progress on key initiatives like Visa Checkout, Apple Pay integration, and tokenization rollout
4. Conservative guidance that factors in FX headwinds, suggesting potential upside

While there are some challenges like FX pressure and gas price impacts, management appears to be executing well and maintaining strong fundamentals. The company's defensive positioning and continued shift to electronic payments should help sustain growth.
