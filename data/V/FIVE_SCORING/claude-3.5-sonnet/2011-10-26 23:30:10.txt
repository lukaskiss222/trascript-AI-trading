Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis for Visa's likely stock price impact over the next 1-2 weeks:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q4 revenue growth of 13% and full year growth of 14%
- International business grew 19%, driving 65% of overall revenue growth
- Healthy credit volume growth trend continues 
- Additional $1B share buyback authorization and 47% dividend increase
- Management reaffirmed guidance for FY2012

Key Concerns:
- Higher than expected client incentives at 17% of revenue
- Ongoing uncertainty around Durbin debit regulation impact
- Slowing process transaction growth trend
- Some signs of potential macro weakness in October metrics

Overall Analysis:
While there are some near-term concerns around incentive costs and debit regulation changes, Visa delivered solid results and demonstrated continued strong execution, particularly internationally. Management's confident tone and commitment to shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends should provide support.

Conclusion: The overall positive results and outlook, combined with management's confidence and shareholder-friendly actions, should drive modestly positive sentiment in the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
