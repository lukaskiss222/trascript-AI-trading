Based on this earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Visa's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong financial performance with Q1 revenue up 12% and broad-based growth across regions and products
2. New CEO Charlie Scharf presented a clear, confident strategic vision while acknowledging existing strengths and opportunities for improvement
3. Additional $1.75B share repurchase authorization announced, demonstrating confidence in future prospects
4. Management's comments suggest gradual improvement in U.S. debit metrics as they lap Durbin regulation impacts
5. Growing international opportunities and continued investment in technology/mobile initiatives like V.me showing traction with major banks

The only minor concerns were around slightly higher operating expenses and ongoing competitive/regulatory challenges, but these were well addressed by management. Overall tone was very positive and forward-looking.
