Based on the earnings call transcript, I would give this a positive rating [1] for the following key reasons:

1. Strong financial performance with revenue growth of 13% YoY to $2.1B and adjusted EPS growth of 38% YoY to $0.95

2. Management maintained their positive outlook with guidance of 11-15% revenue growth and >20% EPS growth for FY2011

3. The company demonstrated confidence by announcing a new $1B share repurchase program and increasing dividends by 20%

4. Early renewal of a major client relationship with no major renewals needed until 2013, providing stability

5. While regulatory uncertainty exists around Durbin Amendment, management appears prepared with multiple strategic options and has factored potential impacts into guidance

The management team came across as confident and prepared for upcoming challenges while maintaining strong growth momentum across their key metrics. Their investments in international expansion and innovation also position them well for continued growth.
