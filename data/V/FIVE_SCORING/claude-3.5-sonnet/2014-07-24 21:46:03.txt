Based on reviewing this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Visa's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. While there are some headwinds around cross-border volumes and currency volatility, management expressed confidence these are temporary and underlying business fundamentals remain strong with healthy payment volume growth.

2. The company is making significant strategic progress in digital payments through Visa Checkout launch with major partners and merchants, positioning well for future growth.

3. Financial results were largely in-line with expectations, and management maintained full year guidance while emphasizing their confidence in long-term double-digit growth prospects.

The tone was reassuring around key concerns and highlighted multiple growth drivers, while acknowledging but not overemphasizing near-term challenges. Management's strategic initiatives and partnerships suggest solid execution.
