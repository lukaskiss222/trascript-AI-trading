Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess that this will likely have a POSITIVE impact on Visa's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

Key Positives:
- Strong quarterly results with revenue up 23% and EPS up 49% YoY
- Management confidently reiterated FY2011 EPS growth guidance of >20% despite regulatory uncertainty
- Cross-border volumes showed sustained strength at 17-18% growth
- Management proactively addressing regulatory changes and expressed confidence in ability to adapt
- Continued strong execution on strategy with completion of CyberSource acquisition

Minor Concerns:
- Some uncertainty around Durbin Amendment impact longer-term
- Slight compression expected in data processing revenue yields
- Higher incentives expected in Q4

Overall, the strong fundamental performance, management's confident outlook, and proactive approach to challenges suggest investors will likely respond positively in the near-term, even with some regulatory uncertainties.
