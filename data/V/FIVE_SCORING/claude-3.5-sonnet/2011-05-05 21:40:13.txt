Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Visa's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong financial performance with 15% revenue growth (to $2.2B) and 23% net income growth, demonstrating robust business momentum despite regulatory uncertainties.

2. International growth is accelerating, with 60% of revenue growth coming from outside the US, helping diversify away from US regulatory risks.

3. Management maintains confident guidance of 11-15% revenue growth and 20%+ EPS growth for 2011, even with potential Durbin Amendment impacts.

The primary concerns are regulatory uncertainties around the Durbin Amendment and its impact on US debit business. However, the company's strong international growth, credit recovery, and management's confident outlook suggest these headwinds are manageable.
