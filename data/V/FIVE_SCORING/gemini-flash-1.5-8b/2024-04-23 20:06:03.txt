Visa's earnings highlights relative stability across various payment segments.  Strong growth in cross-border volumes, particularly e-commerce, offset some weakness in Asian travel. Management reaffirmed guidance, indicating a slight adjustment to the high-single-digits for total payments volume growth.  The company is optimistic about future growth opportunities in consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services,  despite a slightly lower than expected Q2 incentive growth.
