Visa's earnings call highlights a strong recovery in domestic payment volume, driven by the continued shift toward digital payments.  Management expressed optimism about the long-term growth potential, despite acknowledging challenges in the cross-border market due to ongoing travel restrictions.  The guidance for 2021 indicates a likely initial period of muted growth, followed by a potentially significant rebound in the latter half.  The company's focus on value-added services and new payment flows, such as Visa Direct, suggests a strategy to mitigate the impact of the ongoing pandemic and capitalize on the digital shift.
