Visa's Q3 2016 earnings call reflects continued moderate growth, with some volatility in debit card volumes and a focus on integrating the Visa Europe acquisition.  Management highlights the strategic partnership with PayPal, which could boost Visa's share of digital payment volume and potentially offset some of the headwinds.  The call also addresses litigation, with the likely impact being uncertain over the short term.
