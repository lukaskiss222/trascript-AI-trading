Visa's Q1 2015 earnings call indicated continued, but slightly decelerating growth, primarily impacted by a stronger US dollar.  Management is maintaining guidance, but highlighting the potential for lower growth in the first half of the year due to currency headwinds and lower gas prices. Positive trends in e-commerce and tokenization initiatives were also noted.  In the short term, the stock likely faces pressure due to weaker-than-expected cross-border volume and FX volatility.
