Visa's earnings call highlights strong Q2 performance, exceeding expectations on revenue and earnings per share.  Management expressed confidence in their strategy, particularly in the growth of consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services.  Guidance for Q3 suggests continued growth, albeit with some expected headwinds related to inflation, moderating currency volatility,  and lapping previous high tax refund figures.  This suggests a positive short-term impact on the stock, as the consistent growth across various segments and regions is expected to continue.
