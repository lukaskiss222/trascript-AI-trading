Visa's Q3 2012 earnings call highlighted continued strong performance despite the macroeconomic headwinds. Management emphasized ongoing growth in international markets, particularly Asia Pacific and CEMEA, offsetting some volatility in certain regions like Brazil.  The call also addressed the impact of the Durbin Amendment on debit card transactions, with management acknowledging a permanent loss of some debit share but expressing confidence in their mitigation strategies.  Given the positive commentary and the ongoing global migration to digital payments, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
