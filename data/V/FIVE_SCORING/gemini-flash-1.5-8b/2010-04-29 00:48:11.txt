Visa's earnings call highlights strong Q2 2010 results, exceeding expectations on payment volume and revenue growth across all segments.  Management expresses cautious optimism about the prolonged economic recovery, but is clearly pleased with the results of continued growth and the resilience of the company across various payment types. The outlook for the remainder of the year suggests potential near-term headwinds due to lapping of prior year pricing actions and increasing incentives. However, the overall tone is positive, projecting continued growth and profitability.
