Visa's earnings call highlighted expected, albeit slightly slower, Q2 2019 growth.  The primary driver of the slowdown is FX headwinds, but management emphasized strong performance in key regions like CEMEA and Latin America, offsetting some pressures.  The call also showcased continued focus on embedded payments, partnerships with fintechs, and expanding digital acceptance methods, factors that could boost future growth.
