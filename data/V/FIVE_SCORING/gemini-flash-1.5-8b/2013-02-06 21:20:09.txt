Visa's Q1 2013 earnings call highlighted strong growth in global payment volumes, though client incentives fell short of expectations.  Management emphasized continued investment in technology and international expansion, particularly in Asia Pacific.  The company also addressed the ongoing regulatory environment as well as the risk of disintermediation.  These factors, along with the positive outlook for emerging markets, suggest a neutral to moderately positive short-term impact on the stock price.
