Visa's Q3 2015 earnings exceeded expectations, with 12% revenue growth (better than anticipated).  Management cited higher currency volatility and lower-than-expected incentive levels as major drivers.  While guidance for Q4 and FY15 remains positive (double-digit revenue growth), the ongoing uncertainty around cross-border volumes and potential repercussions of Visa Europe's situation likely keep the stock price in a range of flat to slightly positive movement.
