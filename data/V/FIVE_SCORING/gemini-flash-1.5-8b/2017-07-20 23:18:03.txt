Visa's Q3 2017 earnings call highlighted strong performance, exceeding expectations across key metrics.  Management emphasized continued growth in payment volume and process transactions, particularly in international markets.  The call also addressed upcoming European integration and strategic partnerships.  The slight shift in incentive guidance, largely due to timing delays, suggests no significant change in the short-term growth trajectory.
