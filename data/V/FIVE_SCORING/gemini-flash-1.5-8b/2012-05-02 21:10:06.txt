Visa's earnings call highlighted strong performance, particularly in credit card and international markets.  Management raised guidance for fiscal 2012 and reaffirmed 2013 projections, showing confidence in future growth despite the challenges of debit card regulations. The regulatory impact on Interlink is expected to continue negatively impacting volume in the short term, but management seems prepared for this and positive trends likely outweigh these negative developments short-term.
