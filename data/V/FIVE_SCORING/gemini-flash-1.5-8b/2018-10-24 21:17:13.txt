Visa's earnings call highlighted strong performance in Q4 2018, driven by continued growth in payments volume and transactions, particularly in high-growth areas like Asia and Latin America.  Management's tone is optimistic about future growth, emphasizing digital solutions like Visa Direct, contactless and scan-to-pay adoption, and expanding into the B2B sector.  Guidance for 2019 suggests low double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens earnings per share growth, with a focus on continued digital expansion and the utilization of new technologies.
