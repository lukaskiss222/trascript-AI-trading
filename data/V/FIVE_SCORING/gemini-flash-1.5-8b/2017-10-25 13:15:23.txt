Visa's earnings call highlights robust Q4 2017 performance, exceeding expectations, driven by strong cross-border growth (despite a weakening dollar impacting some outbound commerce), healthy domestic growth (driven, in part, by lapping of strong prior-year comparable wins), and significant contract and renewal activity.  Management stressed continued investment in digital solutions and partnerships. The call projects high single-digit payment volume growth and strong EPS growth in FY18, although there are some short-term headwinds with lapping prior year comparisons. This suggests a positive short-term outlook for the stock likely fueled by continued focus on expansion in emerging markets.
