Visa's Q3 2010 earnings transcript shows strong performance, exceeding guidance and exhibiting robust payment volume growth, particularly in cross-border transactions.  Management highlighted the continuing global recovery and the company's expansion into new markets as key drivers.  The uncertainty surrounding the Durbin amendment and potential implications on interchange fees in the future is acknowledged by management without definitive forecasts.  This suggests a positive near-term outlook with likely sustained growth, but potential headwinds in the longer term due to uncertain regulatory changes.
