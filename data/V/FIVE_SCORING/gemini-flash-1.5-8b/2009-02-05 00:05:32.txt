Visa's earnings call highlights a mixed outlook, despite initially positive results. While payment volumes remain robust, driven by debit card usage and transactional growth, management now projects slower revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2009.  This is due to a more significant decline in US payment volume and global cross-border transactions than anticipated, along with the impact of lower gas prices.  This tempered guidance and economic uncertainty likely lead to a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price in the next 1-2 weeks.
