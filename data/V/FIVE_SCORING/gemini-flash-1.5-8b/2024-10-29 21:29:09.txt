Visa's earnings call highlights strong Q4 performance, with revenue exceeding expectations due to lower-than-anticipated incentives, better-than-expected other revenue, and less FX headwind.  Management emphasizes continued growth in consumer payments, new flows (particularly Visa Direct), and value-added services.  The guidance for fiscal 2025 anticipates high single- to low-double-digit adjusted revenue growth, driven by a return to higher incentive growth, although there's a high degree of sensitivity to macro factors.
