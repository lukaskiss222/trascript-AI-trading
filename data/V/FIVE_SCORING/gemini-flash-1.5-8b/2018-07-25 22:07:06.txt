Visa's Q3 2018 earnings call highlighted strong global performance, particularly in Asia and Australia.  Management emphasized continued investment in key markets,  growth in Visa Direct, and positive progress in the European integration.  While the call noted some slowdown in cross-border growth due to a stronger dollar and a bit of a moderation in client incentives, management expects further growth in the future.  The overall tone is optimistic, pointing towards a likely positive short-term impact on the stock price.
