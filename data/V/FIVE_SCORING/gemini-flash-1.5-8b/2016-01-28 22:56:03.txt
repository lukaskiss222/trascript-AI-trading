Visa's Q1 2016 earnings call highlighted a cautious outlook. While payment volume growth was strong, the negative impact of a strong US dollar and weak cross-border transactions due to factors like oil prices and the Chinese economy are significant headwinds. Management's tone was slightly more cautious about short-term growth, indicating potential pressure on revenue, though retaining guidance. These short-term concerns likely lead to a neutral, but perhaps slightly negative, impact on the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
