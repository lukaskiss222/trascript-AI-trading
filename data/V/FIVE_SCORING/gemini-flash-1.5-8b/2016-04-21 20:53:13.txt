Visa's earnings call highlighted continued moderate growth, but with a tempered outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.  Management attributes this to a less-than-expected improvement in macroeconomic trends, particularly regarding cross-border volumes and the ongoing weakness of the USD.  The firm's focus remains on maintaining share and expanding into new technology, like Visa Checkout, but the short-term pressure suggests a potentially sideways to slightly downward trajectory for the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
