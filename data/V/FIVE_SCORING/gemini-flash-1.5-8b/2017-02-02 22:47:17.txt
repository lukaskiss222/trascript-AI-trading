Visa's Q1 2017 earnings call highlights strong performance exceeding expectations, driven by global payment volume growth, especially cross-border transactions.  Management, particularly the new CEO, emphasizes the continuing importance of partnerships, technology innovation, and security.  While currency fluctuations pose a headwind, the overall positive outlook, combined with share repurchases indicates a potential for a moderate positive impact on Visa's stock price in the near term (1-2 weeks).
