Visa's earnings call highlights a cautious outlook despite strong historical performance.  While credit card transactions in the US have moderated,  debit card transactions remain robust.  Management emphasizes the relative resilience of Visa's international business, but a potential slowdown in cross-border volume and ongoing economic uncertainty have led them to project revenues at the lower end of the previously stated 11-15% range for 2009, with possible single-digit growth in the latter part of the year.
