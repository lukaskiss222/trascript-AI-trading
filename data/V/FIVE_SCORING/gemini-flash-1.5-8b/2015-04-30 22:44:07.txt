Visa's Q2 2015 earnings call highlights continued pressure from a strong dollar, impacting cross-border revenue.  Management, however, projects growth will rebound in Q4, driven by a combination of pricing and anticipating lower client incentive rates.  The call also emphasizes Visa's focus on digital solutions (Visa Checkout) and strategic partnerships (Costco), suggesting a positive outlook despite short-term headwinds.
