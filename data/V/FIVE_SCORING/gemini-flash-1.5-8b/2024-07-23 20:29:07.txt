Visa's Q3 2024 earnings call highlighted strong performance across various segments, particularly value-added services and new flows.  Management emphasized stable volume growth, albeit with slight moderation in some U.S. categories, and cited factors like weather, promotional timing, and a tech outage affecting July volume data.  The company projects continued growth, focusing on expanding its value-added services and exploring new opportunities in AI and payment technologies.  This suggests a positive outlook for the stock in the short term.
