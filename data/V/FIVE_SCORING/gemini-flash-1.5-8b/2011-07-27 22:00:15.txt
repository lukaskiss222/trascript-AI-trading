Visa's Q3 2011 earnings call highlighted strong performance, driven by global payment volume growth and a recovery in U.S. credit spend.  Management's strategic response to the new US regulatory environment, including the network participation fee and reduced variable fees for debit transactions, suggests a proactive approach to maintain market share.  This, combined with robust international growth, positions Visa for sustained positive momentum in the short-term.
