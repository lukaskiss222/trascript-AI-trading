Visa's Q1 2019 earnings call highlighted strong domestic performance, particularly in debit and some international markets.  However, the call also flagged a slowdown in cross-border volumes, primarily due to factors like lapping the crypto currency spike, changing European e-commerce traffic patterns, and the strengthening US dollar.  Management cautioned against drawing definitive conclusions about the cross-border slowdown and noted ongoing macro uncertainties. The overall outlook suggests some short-term volatility but Visa remains confident in its long-term strategy, driven by business partnerships and expansion efforts.
