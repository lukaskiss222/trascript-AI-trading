Visa's Q4 2013 earnings call highlights strong revenue growth (13% on a constant dollar basis), driven by global payment volume and significant deal activity.  However, a tempered outlook for U.S. domestic payment volume and a notable FX headwind suggests a nuanced short-term picture. The management team emphasized ongoing efforts toward a more collaborative, strategic partnership model, but the execution timeline and impact remain uncertain.  This will likely result in a neutral or slightly negative impact on the stock price in the near term as investors weigh the mixed short-term and long-term developments.
