Visaâ€™s fiscal third quarter showed revenues and earnings per share both up significantly, with revenue rising 18% and net income surpassing expectations by 40%. Despite a potentially tougher U.S. economy, Visa's guidance remains unchanged with expected growth in the upper end of their range, which reflects the resilience and strength of their business model. This performance, coupled with international growth, suggests strong fundamentals which could positively influence their stock price in the short term.
