Visa's fiscal Q2 2016 earnings call provided a mix of solid execution and ongoing headwinds. The company delivered EPS growth excluding a one-time gain, and maintained good U.S. consumer spending despite global economic challenges. However, revisions to guidance downwards due to persistent low cross-border volumes and lack of improvement in gas prices suggest a cautious short-term outlook. The Visa Europe deal adjustment and delay in closing also add uncertainty, which might weigh on the stock in the near term as the market anticipates the deal's closure and its potential earnings accretion.
