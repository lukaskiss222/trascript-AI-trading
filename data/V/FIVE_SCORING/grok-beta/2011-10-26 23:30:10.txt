Visa Inc.'s solid performance in fiscal Q4 2011, with a 13% revenue increase and strong payment volume growth, especially internationally, suggests a positive outlook. However, concerns about client incentives being slightly ahead of guidance and uncertainties around debit regulation's long-term effects on revenue streams could weigh on investor sentiment. The focus on digital payment innovations and expanding core business globally indicates a strategic shift which might not immediately reflect in stock prices but lays a foundation for future growth. The stock is likely to have a positive short-term reaction due to the earnings beat but might face some volatility as the market processes the incentive spending and regulatory changes.
