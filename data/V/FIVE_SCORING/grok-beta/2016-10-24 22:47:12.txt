Visa reported strong financial results for its fiscal Q4 2016, with high growth in GAAP EPS, net revenue, and a noted recovery in cross-border volumes. However, the inclusion of Visa Europe has significant implications, providing both a boost and complexity due to integration costs and new performance-based incentives. While the company announced several multiyear partnerships and an increase in dividend payouts, the guidance for FY 2017 projects mid-teens EPS growth, suggesting that the market might have already priced in much of the anticipated growth, leading to a potentially neutral short-term impact on stock price.
