Visa's Q4 and full-year 2012 showcased solid performance with strong payment volume growth for credit in the U.S., but guidance for 2013 is tempered by global economic uncertainties. While Visa reaffirmed a high teens growth rate for adjusted diluted EPS, only low double-digit revenue growth is anticipated, suggesting potential short-term challenges due to the tougher comparisons from a strong 2012 and an uncertain economic climate. Nevertheless, the company's initiatives in innovation and strategic growth, including V.me and mobile payments, could provide counterbalance, but the market might take a cautious stance on the slightly conservative guidance.
