Visa Inc.'s fiscal Q3 2012 earnings beat expectations, with strong credit card growth in the U.S. and robust international growth, suggesting short-term stock price positivity. However, concerns include potential increases in client incentives and the ongoing effects of U.S. debit regulations. Management's optimism about future growth, supported by strategic investments and partnerships, supports a positive outlook for the stock in the near term.
