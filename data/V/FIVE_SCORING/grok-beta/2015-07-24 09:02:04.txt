Visa Inc.'s strong financial performance in Q3 2015, with revenue growth and handling of economic uncertainties, should positively impact the stock price in the short term. Despite challenges like foreign exchange rate headwinds and potential volatility in client incentives, the company's strategic moves, including partnerships, profitability signals, and ongoing acquisition talks with Visa Europe, indicate underlying strength. The update on Visa Europe discussions and potential restrictions on buybacks might have a minor moderating effect, but overall sentiment should remain positive.
