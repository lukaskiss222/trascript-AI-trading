Visa's Q1 2013 earnings call was robust, with solid revenue growth and positive trends in global payment volume, including a rebound in U.S. debit transactions. However, the stock might see a slight positive reaction due to concerns like the impact of incentives and the uncertainty around the merchant settlement. The new CEO's focus on strategic partnerships, technology innovation, and regulatory relationships suggests long-term growth potential but might not significantly boost the stock in the short term due to ongoing regulatory and competitive challenges.
