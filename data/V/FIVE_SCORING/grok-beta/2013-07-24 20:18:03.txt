**Analysis:** 
Visa's fiscal Q3 earnings call highlighted several key points relevant for short-term stock price movement. The company raised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance, reflecting strong performance and operational growth across regions. However, there were factors such as lower-than-expected service revenue due to the timing of the Chase deal, potential regulatory impacts in Europe, and uncertainties around tokenization strategy. While the revised guidance and global payment volume growth signal positive momentum, the regulatory uncertainties and strategic agreements could introduce volatility or cautious investor sentiment in the short term.

**Conclusion:** 
The positive guidance and solid global payment volume growth are expected to contribute to a moderate upward movement in Visa’s stock price in the next 1–2 weeks, but potential negative impacts from regulatory developments in key markets and unresolved issues with tokenization might temper this effect.
