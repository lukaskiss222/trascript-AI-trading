Visa Inc.'s fiscal Q2 2014 earnings call provided mixed signals for short-term stock price implications. While the company continues to exhibit a strong competitive position, growth in transaction volume, and investment in new technology, several factors suggest caution:

- **Cross-Border Volume**: Significant weaknesses noted in specific corridors, particularly affecting Latin America and Europe, which could continue to suppress revenue growth.
  
- **Russia**: Despite the small volume of transactions Russia represents, potential regulatory changes might pose an operational risk not only in Russia but could set a precedent for other countries.

- **Downward Revision**: Easing of earlier guidance, with revenue growth expectations lowered by 2 percentage points due to cross-border transaction softness.

- **Expense Increase**: Anticipated increase in expenses in the latter half, potentially affecting margins.

- **Short-term Headwinds**: Noteworthy competitive activities in the debit market might impact Visa's share.

**Conclusion**: 

Visa's call suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook in the short-term due to these factors. Ongoing operational excellence and technological investments bode well for long-term growth, but near-term headwinds may undercut the immediate stock price movement. 

**Rating:**
