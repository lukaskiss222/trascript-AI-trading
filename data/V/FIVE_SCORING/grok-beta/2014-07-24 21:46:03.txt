Visa Inc.'s Q3 2014 earnings call suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook. The company faced headwinds from lower currency volatility and foreign exchange, which have impacted revenue growth rates. However, strong payment volume growth in both the U.S. and international markets, along with the introduction of Visa Checkout, signal potential for future growth. Visa's commitment to share buybacks and cost management should provide some support, but the ongoing uncertainties with international markets, especially Russia, might temper immediate stock reactions.
