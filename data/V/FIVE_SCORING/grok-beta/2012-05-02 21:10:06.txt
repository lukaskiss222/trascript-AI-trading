Visa Inc.'s robust Q2 performance, including a significant EPS increase and strong global volume growth, outweighs the short-term concerns from regulatory changes in the U.S. debit market. The guidance for FY2012 EPS growth raised to high teens to low 20s, along with strategic moves like expanding partnerships in key markets such as Brazil and Asia Pacific, underpins a positive near-term outlook for the stock. Management's optimism and the company's strategic positioning in the evolving payment ecosystem suggest that despite potential regulatory headwinds, Visa's fundamentals are strong and likely to support stock growth in the near term.
