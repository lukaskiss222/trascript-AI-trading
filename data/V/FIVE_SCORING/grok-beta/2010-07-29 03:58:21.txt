Visa Inc.'s Q3 2010 earnings call highlighted several factors that could influence the stock's performance in the short term. The company delivered strong earnings results, surpassing expectations with significant growth in payments volume, cross-border volume, and transaction processing. The reaffirmation of their FY 2011 EPS growth guidance at over 20%, suggesting confidence in their strategic adaptation to the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, provides optimism. However, uncertainties about how the legislation will impact Visaâ€™s business and debit interchange fees are present, possibly introducing market volatility or temporary negative pressures until clarity is provided. The continued focus on global growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions like CyberSource add a positive outlook for the stock.
