Visa reported a strong fiscal Q2 2010, with payment volumes, transactions, and revenues all increasing, signaling an economic upturn. However, management's cautious optimism and slightly higher rebates and incentives in the second half could cap near-term stock appreciation. The acquisition of CyberSource, if completed, might provide additional long-term support, but the stock's short-term momentum could be tempered by Visa's conservative forward guidance and lower incentives expectations in the back half of the year.
