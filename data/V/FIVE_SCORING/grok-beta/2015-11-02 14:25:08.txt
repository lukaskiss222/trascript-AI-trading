Visa Inc. reported strong fiscal Q4 2015 results with robust revenue and earnings growth despite currency headwinds, signaling underlying business resilience. The acquisition of Visa Europe, although likely to dilute EPS in the short term, is expected to be accretive by 2017, offering long-term growth prospects. Additionally, Visa's focus on expanding digital and new payment solutions like Visa Checkout should positively influence stock sentiment.
