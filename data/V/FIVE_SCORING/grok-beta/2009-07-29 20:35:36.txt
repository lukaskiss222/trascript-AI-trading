Visa Inc.'s Q3 2009 earnings call portrayed a company performing well against expectations despite economic headwinds. The reaffirmation of guidance, an optimistic outlook for Q4, and strategic moves like contract renewals and expansion into new markets like prepaid card space suggest a robust strategic positioning for future growth. However, concerns about rebates and a cautious economic recovery tempering growth rates might result in a minor positive influence on the stock in the short term.
