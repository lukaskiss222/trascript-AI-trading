Visa's earnings call reveals continued solid performance, with record revenues and EPS growth. The company's aggressive incentivising of merchants and acquirers to secure routing decisions is a strategic move to mitigate potential losses from regulatory changes. International expansion and a focus on credit card growth are positive long-term strategies, but investment in these areas could impact short-term margins. The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the coming weeks.   [0]
