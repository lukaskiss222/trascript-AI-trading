Despite reporting solid Q3 earnings, Visa's stock will likely face negative pressure in the short term. The establishment of a merchant settlement fund and the negative impact of the Durbin-Wamitié Amendment on Visa's U.S. debit card business are significant concerns. While the company is taking measures to mitigate losses, the full impact will be felt in Q4 and probably into the following quarters. Uncertainties around the global economy, especially in key markets like China, Brazil, and Europe, also cast a shadow on Visa's immediate prospects. The negative factors outlined above are likely to outweigh any potential positives, at least in the next 1–2 weeks. [-1]
