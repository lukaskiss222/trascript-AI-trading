The Nasdaq stock of Visa Inc. is likely to face short-term pressure following its Q4 earnings call. The group reported solid performance but offered conservative guidance for FY2015 due to global economic uncertainties, low currency volatility, and a strong US dollar. The Huntsman's $450 million litigation escrow deposit hurt their reported earnings, although it benefitually reduced their share count. Visa's revenue growth outlook is dragged down by continuing headwinds, including tempered cross-border growth and trval currency fluctuations. Notably, their cautious outlook extends beyond the current quarter, keeping expectations low until global economic improvement becomes more evident.
