Visa's strong Q2 performance, marked by robust credit and international growth, is expected to buoy the stock in the short term. Management's confidence in their strategies, despite regulatory headwinds in the debit market, and their upgraded 2012 guidance further support the positive outlook. The introduction of new services and agreements indicate sustained growth potential. The stock is poised for a good run in the next 1â€“2 weeks. [1]
