Visa's earnings transcript demonstrates strong performance, with 15% net revenue growth and an increase in U.S. debit payment volumes. The management's positive tone and increased EPS guidance to around 20% for fiscal 2013 indicate confidence in the company's outlook. Strategic partnerships, such as those with Chase and Samsung, as well as share repurchases, further strengthen the company's position. While there is some uncertainty in Europe, Visa's current business model demonstrates resilience to external factors. Overall, the performance and guidance suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock.
