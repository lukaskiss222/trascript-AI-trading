Visa Inc. reported strong fiscal third-quarter 2024 earnings, with net revenue up 10% year-over-year and EPS up 12%. The results highlighted stable business drivers and growth in areas like cross-border volume and value-added services, despite a slight moderation in U.S. payment volumes and macroeconomic pressures in Asia. Management's optimistic tone and robust guidance suggest continued solid performance, further supported by strategic partnerships and innovative offerings like Visa Direct. The positive earnings and forward-looking statements likely indicate a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.
