Visa's fiscal Q2 2020 earnings call highlights resilience amidst the COVID-19 disruption. Although cross-border volumes and certain discretionary spending categories dropped significantly, Visa showed strong growth in e-commerce and digital payments, indicating increased consumer adaptation to these channels. Management's focus on cost control, preserving investments in growth areas, and its commitment to not laying off employees in 2020 reflect confidence in its long-term strategy. The company also noted potential structural shifts towards digital payments, which if sustained, can provide positive momentum. However, the uncertainty around the duration of recovery presents challenges.
