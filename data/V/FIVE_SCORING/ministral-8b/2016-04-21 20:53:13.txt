### Analysis

The earnings call for Visa Inc. revealed several key points that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Slowing Cross-Border Growth**: The company reported a slowdown in cross-border volume growth, which is primarily due to the strong dollar, weak oil prices, and economic slowdowns in China and commodity-based economies. This is a significant headwind for Visa's revenue growth.

2. **Interest Expense**: The company issued $16 billion in debt to finance the Visa Europe acquisition, which has resulted in $125 million in interest expense in the current quarter. This expense negatively impacts EPS growth by five points.

3. **Delayed Visa Europe Acquisition**: The deal to acquire Visa Europe remains subject to regulatory approvals and may not close before the end of the fiscal year. The company expects the transaction to close towards the end of the quarter but acknowledges that it could slip past the end of the third fiscal quarter.

4. **Costco and USAA Renewals**: The company has secured significant renewal deals with Costco and USAA, which are expected to drive growth in the back half of the year. However, these deals are not expected to provide immediate benefits to the company's financials.

5. **Mobile Payments Adoption**: The company is focused on accelerating mobile payments adoption but acknowledges that the growth rates are not exponential. They are working with third-party players like Apple and Google to promote mobile payments.

### Conclusion

The earnings call highlighted several challenges that Visa Inc. is facing, including slowing cross-border growth, interest expense, and delayed acquisitions. While the company has secured significant renewal deals, these deals are not expected to provide immediate benefits. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to these challenges. However, the company's long-term fundamentals remain strong, and they are focused on accelerating global electronic payments.
