**Analysis:**
Visa Inc.'s Q2 earnings call revealed strong financial performance, with net operating revenues of $2.6 billion and adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, up 15% and 23% year-over-year, respectively. The company also upgraded its fiscal 2012 EPS guidance to high teens to low 20s range. However, the call highlighted challenges in the U.S. debit market due to regulatory changes, which may impact Visa's U.S. debit payment volumes and market share. Additionally, the company's guidance for fiscal 2013 remains unchanged, with revenue growth expected to accelerate off of 2012 levels and EPS growth expected to be in the high teens. The company's strong performance and positive outlook suggest a positive impact on the stock price in the short term, but the challenges in the U.S. debit market may create some uncertainty.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to Visa's strong financial performance and positive guidance. However, the challenges in the U.S. debit market may create some uncertainty and limit the stock's upside potential.
