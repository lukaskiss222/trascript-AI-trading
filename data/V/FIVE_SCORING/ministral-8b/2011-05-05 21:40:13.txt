**Analysis:**

Visa Inc.'s Q2 2011 earnings call revealed strong financial performance, with revenue up 15% and EPS up 28% year-over-year. The company's growth was driven by double-digit payment volume growth, particularly in cross-border and Visa-processed transactions. Notable achievements included a new deal with the State Bank of India, a multiyear credit and debit agreement with HSBC, and a new prepaid unemployment insurance program with Chase in Connecticut. Additionally, Visa announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program, bringing the total to $2.8 billion in fiscal 2011.

Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to maintain growth despite potential impacts from the Durbin amendment, highlighting the importance of international markets and the company's ability to adapt to regulatory changes. The company also emphasized its focus on innovation, including its plans to make an announcement regarding its global eCommerce and mobile strategy later this month.

**Conclusion:**

Given the strong financial performance, the company's focus on international growth, and its ability to adapt to regulatory changes, Visa Inc. is likely to see a positive impact on its stock price in the short term. The company's aggressive investment in growth initiatives and its commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends further support this positive outlook.
