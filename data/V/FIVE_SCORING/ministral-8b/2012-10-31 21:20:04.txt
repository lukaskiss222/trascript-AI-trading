**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Visa Inc. revealed solid performance in Q4 and full-year 2012, with net operating revenue and earnings per share (EPS) growth. However, the company provided cautious guidance for 2013, reflecting economic uncertainties and the impact of U.S. debit regulation. The appointment of Charlie Scharf as CEO was highlighted as a strategic move to continue Visa's growth trajectory. The call also emphasized the company's innovation agenda, including V.me and CyberSource, which are expected to drive growth in the future.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Visa's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's strong performance in 2012 and the appointment of a new CEO could provide reassurance to investors. However, the cautious guidance for 2013 and economic uncertainties may temper any immediate stock price rally.
