### Analysis

The earnings call for Visa Inc. in the fiscal second quarter of 2010 presented a mixed picture. The company reported strong revenue growth and positive earnings, with net income increasing by 33% year-over-year. However, the company also highlighted challenges such as the potential impact of the CyberSource acquisition on future guidance and the ongoing merchant lawsuits. The management team expressed optimism about the economic recovery and the potential for continued growth in both the domestic and international markets. Despite these positive signals, the lack of specific guidance for 2011 and the potential for increased expenses from the CyberSource acquisition may lead to some uncertainty among investors. Overall, the call provided a mixed signal, with both positive and negative aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral, given the mixed signals from the earnings call and the potential for increased expenses from the CyberSource acquisition. The stock may experience some volatility due to the uncertainty surrounding the company's guidance for 2011 and the ongoing merchant lawsuits. However, the strong revenue growth and positive earnings reported in the second quarter of 2010 may provide some support for the stock price in the short term.
