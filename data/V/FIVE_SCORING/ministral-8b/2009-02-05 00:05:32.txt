**Analysis:**

Visa Inc.'s Q1 2009 earnings call revealed solid financial results, with revenues and earnings growth exceeding expectations. However, the company acknowledged a slowdown in US payment volume growth and projected revenue growth to be in the low single digits for the back half of 2009. This is a significant downgrade from their initial guidance and suggests a more challenging economic environment. Despite this, Visa remains optimistic about their long-term prospects, particularly in emerging markets.

**Conclusion:**

The stock market is likely to react negatively to the downgraded revenue guidance and the broader economic uncertainty. However, the company's strong financial performance and optimistic outlook for long-term growth may provide some support. Overall, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative.

**Rating:**
