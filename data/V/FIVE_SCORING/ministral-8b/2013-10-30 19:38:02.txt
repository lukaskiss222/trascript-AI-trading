### Analysis:

Visa Inc.'s Q4 and full-year 2013 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. While the company reported strong growth in revenue and EPS, the callout of FX headwinds and the tepid recovery in U.S. consumer spending pose challenges. The company's guidance for 2014, which includes a constant dollar revenue growth of low-double-digits and an FX headwind of around two percentage points, reflects these concerns. Despite the challenges, the company's focus on strategic growth, cost-saving measures, and potential acquisitions suggests long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

### Conclusion:

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be **negative**.
