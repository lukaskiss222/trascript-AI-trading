Based on the earnings transcript, Visa Inc. reported strong financial performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, despite some challenges. The company achieved net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 10% increase over the same period last year, and net income of $1.1 billion, a 20% increase. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.56, a 25% increase over the same period last year. The company also repurchased 4 million shares during the quarter, using $461 million of its excess cash.

However, the company faced some challenges in the U.S. debit market, where payment volumes decreased by 9% due to regulatory changes. The company expects a similar impact in the next few quarters. Additionally, the company is facing potential tax issues related to the American Express litigation.

Overall, the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects and continues to invest in growth opportunities, such as V.me and mobile payments. The company expects to continue to grow its business and return excess cash to shareholders.

Given the strong financial performance and the company's optimistic outlook, I predict that the stock price will experience a positive impact in the short term. However, the company's challenges in the U.S. debit market and potential tax issues could cause some volatility in the stock price.
