**Analysis:**

Visa's earnings call reveals a mixed picture. On one hand, the company reported strong financial performance, with adjusted net income of $448 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.58 in Q4 2008. The full-year results were also impressive, with adjusted net income of $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.25. The company's revenue growth was robust, with net operating revenues increasing by 21% year-over-year. However, there are concerns about the future, with a slowdown in consumer spending activity in the US and cross-border buyers. The company expects revenue growth to come in at the lower end of its guidance range in 2009 and 2010, with the possibility of single-digit growth in the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, the company is facing uncertainty over the longer term direction of the economy in the US and around the globe.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Visa's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, given the company's strong financial performance and the fact that it is well-positioned to benefit from the long-term trends in the payment industry. However, the uncertainty around the economic outlook and the potential for single-digit revenue growth in the second half of 2009 could put downward pressure on the stock price in the short term. Overall, the stock is likely to trade in a range, with a potential for a slight rally if the economic outlook improves.
