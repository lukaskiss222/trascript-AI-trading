### Analysis

The earnings call for Visa Inc. revealed strong performance with 15% net revenue growth in Q2 2013, driven by robust credit and debit growth in the U.S. and the Rest of the World. The company also reported improved U.S. debit payment volume growth and a return to positive growth in the aggregate U.S. debit business after the Dodd-Frank routing rules were adopted. The new 10-year deal structure with Chase has the effect of reducing gross fees and revenue incentives, which led to a reduction in full-year client incentive outlook. The company increased its fiscal 2013 EPS guidance from high teens to around 20% due to a more certain revenue outlook and earlier than planned share repurchases. The company also spent $1.8 billion to repurchase 12 million shares at an average price of $157, indicating a strong commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.

### Conclusion

Overall, the earnings call was positive, with strong revenue growth and improved U.S. debit payment volume. The company's guidance for the balance of fiscal 2013 was also revised upward, indicating confidence in future performance. The Chase deal was highlighted as a significant milestone, but the specifics of the deal and its impact on revenue were not disclosed. The company's commitment to share repurchases and dividend payments also signals a strong focus on shareholder returns. Given these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive, as investors will likely view the strong revenue growth and improved EPS guidance as a positive signal for the company's future performance.
