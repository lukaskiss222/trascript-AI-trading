Based on the earnings transcript for Visa Inc., the company reported strong financial performance despite some headwinds. The key points include:

- **Revenue Growth**: Visa Inc. reported revenue growth of 7% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis, driven by steady payment volume growth in the U.S. and internationally. However, cross-border growth remained soft due to political tensions and low currency volatility.
- **Guidance**: The company narrowed its 2014 full-year revenue growth guidance to 9% to 10% on a constant dollar basis, which translates to 7% to 8% nominally. EPS guidance was also narrowed to 17.5% to 18.5%.
- **Incentives**: Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue were narrowed to around 17% from the prior range of 16.5% to 17.5%. This puts the fourth quarter at north of 19%.
- **Digital Initiatives**: Visa Inc. is investing heavily in digital commerce, including Visa Checkout and a suite of digital solutions. The company is also expanding its partnerships with merchants, financial institutions, and technology companies to drive digital payment adoption.

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, given the strong financial performance and the company's continued investment in digital initiatives. However, the stock may face some pressure due to the dampened cross-border growth and currency volatility.
