**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Visa Inc. revealed strong financial results, with revenue growth of 17% driven by broad-based global payment volume growth. Despite the absence of significant one-time client incentives, the company's performance was impressive. However, the call also highlighted some challenges, including the impact of the Chase deal on service revenue and the need for continued growth in the U.S. debit market. The company's guidance for 2013 was raised to around 13% for revenue and low 20s for adjusted EPS, indicating confidence in the company's ability to maintain growth momentum. Additionally, the company's focus on strategic growth initiatives, such as the Chase deal and V.me, suggests a long-term commitment to expanding its market share and diversifying its revenue streams.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive, as the company's strong financial results and optimistic guidance indicate a robust outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. The company's focus on strategic growth initiatives and its ability to navigate regulatory challenges should also provide a strong foundation for continued growth. However, the stock may face some short-term volatility due to the competitive nature of the payments industry and the need for continued growth in the U.S. debit market.
