- Global quarterly payments volume up 13% year-over-year, excluding Russia and China.
- U.S. payments volume up 10% year-over-year.
- Consumer payments remain a massive opportunity with growth in credentials, acceptance, and engagement.
- Strong growth in new flows, including Visa Direct and B2B Connect.
- Value-added services revenue grew 20% in constant dollars.

Management provided guidance for the third quarter, expecting net revenue growth in the low double-digits, inclusive of an approximately 1 point drag from exchange rate. They also expect non-GAAP operating expense growth to moderate through the year.

The company's strong performance and optimistic outlook suggest a positive impact on the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks. However, the stock may face short-term pressure due to the potential impact of new regulations and the moderation in currency volatility.
