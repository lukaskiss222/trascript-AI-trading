**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Visa Inc. revealed a mixed bag of results for the fiscal year 2020. The company reported a 4% decrease in constant dollar net revenues, driven primarily by a 22% decline in cross-border volumes. This was offset by strong growth in debit and card-not-present volumes, which increased by 17% and 30% respectively. The company also reported a 23% decline in non-GAAP EPS, but a significant return of capital to shareholders, with $10.8 billion returned through share repurchases and dividends.

The company expects to continue its investment in growth initiatives, including Visa Direct, B2B Connect, and value-added services.
