### Conclusion

**Rating:** 1

**Explanation:** While the strong Q4 results and positive outlook for 2025 are encouraging, the short-term impact might be slightly muted due to the focus on long-term growth strategies and the potential for regulatory headwinds. Overall, Visa's performance and prospects remain positive, but the immediate market reaction might be tempered by the complexity of the regulatory environment and the focus on long-term strategic initiatives.
