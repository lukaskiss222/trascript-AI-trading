Boeing's Q3 2018 earnings call highlighted strong commercial airplane performance and a significant investment in defense programs (T-X and MQ-25).  Management emphasized the long-term value of these investments, despite substantial charges in the quarter.  The projected increase in commercial production (to 57 737s per month) and healthy overall order book suggest a positive outlook for the stock within the next few weeks.
