Boeing's earnings call highlighted strong fourth-quarter free cash flow generation and continued robust demand, driven by 737 MAX and 787 deliveries.  Management emphasized focusing on supply chain stability and improving production rates, but acknowledged ongoing challenges.  The call indicates a short-term focus on execution and improvement of the manufacturing process, which could have a moderate positive impact on the stock price in the next few weeks, given the improvement in cash flow and demand.
