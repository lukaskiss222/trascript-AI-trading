Boeing's earnings call highlighted strong performance, surpassing expectations with revenue, earnings per share, and cash flow growth.  The company raised its 2007 guidance due to robust commercial airplane orders and strong IDS performance, albeit with a noted increase in R&D spending primarily due to 787 program complexities. This suggests investor confidence in the company's future.  Positive sentiment and the anticipation of continued demand for commercial aircraft, particularly the 787, likely will drive continued positive stock price momentum in the next 1-2 weeks.
