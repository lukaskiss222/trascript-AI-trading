Boeing's earnings call highlights a cautious outlook for 2010.  While the company achieved record revenue and strong cash flow in 2009, the guidance for 2010 reflects lower volumes and continued investment in the 787 and 747 programs.  The management's comments suggest some uncertainty about the timing of the 787 deliveries and ongoing cost assessments could affect short-term stock performance.
