Boeing's Q3 2014 earnings call highlighted strong performance, with record commercial airplane orders and backlog, and increases in core earnings per share and operating margins.  Management emphasized robust commercial demand due to replacement orders and the value proposition of new, fuel-efficient aircraft.  Production rate increases were detailed, specifically for the 737 MAX, 787, and 777X, suggesting a positive outlook for future production.  While deferred production costs are above expectations for the 787, management attributes this to strategic inventory management to ensure a smoother introduction of new models. The call indicates a bullish outlook for the stock, particularly since backlog and demand exceed current production rates.
