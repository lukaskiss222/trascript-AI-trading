Boeing's earnings call highlighted significant challenges in 2008, including the machinists' strike and 747-8 program delays.  While the company maintained a strong backlog and healthy performance in key segments like defense, the substantial charges and downward guidance signal a short-term negative impact on the stock price.  The focus on addressing program execution issues and cost-cutting measures,  coupled with uncertainty around the global economic downturn, suggests cautious optimism for the immediate future but significant uncertainty in the medium term.
