Boeing's Q1 2012 earnings call highlighted continued strength in commercial airplane demand, a healthy backlog, and successful execution of key programs like the 787 and 737 MAX.  Management expressed confidence in meeting production goals and improving cost structures, particularly on the 787, while acknowledging a challenging defense market.  The stock is likely to see positive reactions in the next 1â€“2 weeks due to the projected strong performance and robust backlog across multiple product lines.
