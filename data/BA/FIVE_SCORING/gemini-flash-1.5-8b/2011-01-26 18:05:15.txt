Boeing's earnings call highlights continued challenges with the 787 program, despite strong commercial demand and a rebound in air traffic.  The revised 787 schedule, resulting in higher-than-expected R&D and associated inventory costs, is a key short-term concern, potentially impacting profitability.  While management expresses confidence in the long-term outlook and anticipates a ramp-up in commercial production, the current situation suggests a period of muted enthusiasm and potential pressure on the stock price over the next couple of weeks.
