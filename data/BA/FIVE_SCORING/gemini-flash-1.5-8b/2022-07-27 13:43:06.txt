Boeing's earnings call highlighted a strong demand for their products, especially in the freighter market.  Management emphasized the company's focus on stabilizing production and deliveries, addressing supply chain constraints, particularly with engine components, which is likely impacting near-term delivery targets.  While positive operating cash flow was achieved, the discussion regarding MAX and 787 deliveries suggests that short-term stock movement might be influenced by the company's ability to satisfy existing orders and meet projected numbers.
