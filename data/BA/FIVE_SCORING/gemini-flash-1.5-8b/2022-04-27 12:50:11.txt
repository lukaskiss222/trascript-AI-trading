Boeing's earnings call highlighted challenges in the first quarter, primarily stemming from the war in Ukraine, inflation, and lingering COVID-19 impacts.  While management emphasized a commitment to positive free cash flow in 2022 and stronger performance in 2023, substantial write-offs in the defense sector and challenges related to 787 and 37 MAX deliveries suggest a period of short-term pressure. The call suggests investors should anticipate some volatility in the short-term (1-2 weeks) as the market digests the details.
