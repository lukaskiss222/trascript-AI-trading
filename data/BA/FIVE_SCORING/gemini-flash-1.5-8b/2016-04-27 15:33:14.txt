Boeing's Q1 2016 earnings call highlighted strong commercial deliveries and healthy defense revenue growth, but also acknowledged a $0.24 charge on the KC-46 tanker program.  Management reaffirmed full-year guidance, emphasizing confident execution across core programs, including 737 MAX flight testing, 787-10 assembly, and continued strong demand in both commercial and defense markets.  The company's focus on productivity initiatives, cost reduction, and return on cash investments, while noting the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, suggests a positive outlook for the next 1-2 weeks, potentially boosting investor confidence.
