Boeing's earnings call highlights continued strong commercial performance, driven by robust backlog and new orders.  Management emphasizes a commitment to production rate increases and profitable growth, particularly in the 737 line.  Some concerns linger regarding the 777 production ramp-down and potential cost pressures within the Tanker program and Network & Space Systems, but the overall tone is optimistic and suggests the company is positioned for short-term strength in the stock.
