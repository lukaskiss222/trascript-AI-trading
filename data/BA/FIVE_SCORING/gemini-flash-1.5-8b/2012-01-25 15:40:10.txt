Boeing's earnings call highlights strong commercial orders, particularly for the 737 MAX, fueling a robust backlog.  Management expresses confidence in the company's ability to meet production targets, despite challenges with the 787 ramp-up, which includes addressing change incorporation. The call suggests a near-term focus on successful ramp-up, quality improvements, and maintaining profitability, especially for new programs. The projected 2012 gains are likely to be impacted by pension outlays.
