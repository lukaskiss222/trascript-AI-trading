Boeing's earnings call highlights ongoing challenges with their 787 program, impacting both production and delivery schedules.  While reaffirming guidance, the company acknowledges external economic headwinds affecting airline customers, potentially leading to further delivery deferrals. The management's tone emphasizes a focus on productivity improvements and maintaining a strong backlog position to mitigate potential economic downturns.  This suggests short-term volatility, but longer-term prospects are seen as robust.
