Boeing's earnings call, focusing on the 737 MAX grounding, paints a picture of short-term challenges and long-term resilience.  The updated guidance regarding the MAX return to service, potentially pushing it into the early fourth quarter, creates uncertainty and a possible need for production adjustments.  Management's acknowledgment of ongoing challenges, including regulatory hurdles and training requirements, suggests a likely negative impact on the stock price in the near term (1â€“2 weeks) as investors await further clarity on the timeline and potential financial implications.
