Boeing's earnings call highlights strong commercial demand and positive free cash flow, despite ongoing supply chain challenges and fixed-price contract losses in the defense sector.  Management expresses confidence in achieving delivery targets, particularly for the 737, and anticipates a positive trajectory in the second half of the year.  The company's focus on execution, supply chain stability, and backlog suggests potential for a gradual, positive short-term stock impact.
