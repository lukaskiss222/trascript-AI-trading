Boeing's earnings call highlights strong commercial performance, driven by high backlog and increasing production rates for the 787 and 737 MAX.  However, the call also notes ongoing issues with 787 dispatch reliability and some pressure in the air cargo market prompting a reduction in 747 production.  The defense sector shows good revenue but remains cautious due to budget uncertainty and sequestration.  These mixed signals are likely to lead to a period of sideways movement or a slight downward pressure on the stock over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
