Boeing's earnings call indicates a positive short-term outlook, with accelerating production plans for the 777 and 747-8, driven by improving commercial market conditions and order increases.  Management is confident in the current demand and suggests this upward trajectory will continue beyond this year, supporting the rate increases of both commercial aircraft.  Improved flight testing for the 787 and the 747-8 first flight further bolster confidence.
