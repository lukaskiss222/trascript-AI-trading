Boeing's Q3 2016 earnings call highlighted strong performance, driven by healthy commercial airplane orders, especially for the 737 MAX, and positive defense contracts.  Management expressed confidence in long-term market trends and a projected strong replacement cycle, but acknowledged some near-term hesitation in the wide-body market.  The guidance update indicated a flat to slightly down revenue outlook for 2017, primarily due to delivery mix, but maintained a forecast for strong cash flow growth.
