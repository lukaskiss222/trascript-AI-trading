Boeing's earnings call highlights a significant delay in the 787 program.  While the company achieved strong financial results across other lines of business, the revised 787 schedule will likely lead to decreased 2008 revenue and a shift of deliveries into 2009.  Management's focus on addressing supply chain issues and customer relations, alongside improving program management, suggests a long-term plan, but short-term investor concerns about the 787 program will likely create negative pressure on the stock price.
