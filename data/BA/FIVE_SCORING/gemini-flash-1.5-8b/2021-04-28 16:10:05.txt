Boeing's earnings call highlighted ongoing challenges with the 737 MAX, impacting deliveries and profitability.  While the company saw some positive momentum in domestic travel, international travel remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels.  Management emphasized a focus on stabilizing production and addressing lingering MAX issues, positioning themselves as committed to long-term market recovery.  This suggests a potential for short-term stock price pressure but underlying optimism for a long-term return to growth given the ongoing recovery and the focus on cost-cutting.
