Boeing's Q2 2016 earnings call highlights continued strong commercial airplane deliveries and healthy backlog, but significant charges from decisions on 787 and 747 programs, and KC-46 tanker investments negatively impacted earnings.  Management emphasized that these decisions were strategically necessary to mitigate long-term risks and improve profitability, while maintaining optimistic guidance for revenue and cash flow.  The stock price is likely to remain volatile in the near term given the uncertainties around the 777 production ramp, while the strong commercial aircraft market represents some positive upside.
