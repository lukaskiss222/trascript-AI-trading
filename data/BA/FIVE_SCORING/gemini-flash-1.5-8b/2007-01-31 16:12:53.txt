Boeing's earnings call highlights significant backlog growth and strong financial performance in 2006, leading to raised earnings guidance and a new share repurchase program for 2007 and 2008.  However, ongoing challenges with the 787 program, including supply chain issues and cost overruns on the AEW&C program, could potentially impact short-term stock performance although management expresses confidence in overcoming these hurdles.  The call suggests continued, but moderate, defense spending concerns, leaving the stock's fate to the 787 program's ability to manage its production ramp-up.
