Boeing's Q2 2013 earnings call highlights continued strong performance, driven by robust order activity and healthy commercial airplane deliveries. Management emphasized the importance of productivity gains and the "partnering for success" initiative to maintain profitability amidst a challenging defense environment.  The call underscored confidence in the 787 program despite the recent incident, with management prioritizing safety and working closely with regulators. This positive outlook and the company's continued focus on cost-effective innovation likely leads to a positive impact on the stock price in the next 1-2 weeks.
