Boeing's earnings call highlighted a strong financial performance despite challenges with the 787 program.  Management emphasized a robust backlog and strong global demand, particularly outside the US.  However, the revised 787 schedule and associated production delays led to lower revenue and delivery guidance for 2008, along with a slightly reduced cash flow outlook.  The company maintains confidence in the 787's long-term success and expects to fully address the program's challenges by the end of the first quarter.  Short-term impact on the stock price is likely negative due to the 787 schedule revision, although management appears to be actively working to mitigate the damage.
