Boeing's earnings call highlights strong demand for their aircraft, particularly the 737 and 777, driving production rate increases.  The decision to re-engine the 737 rather than develop a new model in the near term suggests a desire for quicker market entry and potentially lower risk.  This, along with continued strong order books and excellent operational performance, should lead to positive investor sentiment and potentially a stock price rally in the short-term.
