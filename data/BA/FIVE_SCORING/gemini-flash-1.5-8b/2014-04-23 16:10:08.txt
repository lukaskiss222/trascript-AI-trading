Boeing's Q1 2014 earnings call highlighted strong financial performance, robust order intake, and significant investments in future growth.  Management emphasized the strength of the backlog and sustained high demand for commercial airplanes, with a positive outlook for the 777X program.  The call addressed concerns over deferred production costs but projected a decline later in the year.  A strong tone and proactive measures taken to address labor relations and potential supply chain issues give reason for confidence in the stock's short-term resilience.
