Boeing's earnings call highlights a strong financial performance and a positive outlook, despite some program-specific challenges.  Management's emphasis on long-term growth strategies, including further production ramp-ups on the 737, strong backlog, and the 777X program, suggests a positive short-term impact on the stock price driven by confidence in the future.  The lowered 777 production rate appears to be a strategic decision rather than a negative signal.
