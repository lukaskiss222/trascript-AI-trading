Boeing's earnings call highlights significant headwinds from the global economic downturn, impacting commercial airplane demand and potentially defense budgets.  The company has responded by cutting 777 and some other production rates, deferring deliveries, and reducing price escalation forecasts, resulting in a reduced earnings per share.  While Boeing maintains a large backlog, the uncertain economic climate and adjustments to future delivery commitments suggest short-term pressure on the stock price, though strong performance in commercial services and defense remains positive.
