Boeing's earnings call highlighted continued challenges, particularly in the Defense segment. While commercial demand remains robust, the company is facing supply chain issues and quality control problems impacting 737 deliveries.  Management acknowledged the negative impact on margins, but expressed confidence in the long-term strategy and achieving the $10B free cash flow target by 2025-26.  Short-term, the stock may see a mixed reaction, possibly some pressure with the uncertainty about the full extent of the 737 MAX production issues and the Defense segment's profitability.
