Boeing's earnings call highlighted strong commercial airplane performance and a robust backlog.  However, the charges related to the AEW&C program and the global settlement significantly impacted earnings, and management explicitly stated their reluctance to seek tax deductibility.  The call also hinted at potential challenges in the supply chain and competition, potentially impacting the stock price negatively in the short term, especially considering management's mixed outlook on the tanker program and the continuing 787 program challenges.
