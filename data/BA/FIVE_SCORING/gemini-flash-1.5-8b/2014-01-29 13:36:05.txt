Boeing's earnings call highlighted a strong performance in 2013, marked by record revenue, earnings, and backlog.  Management expressed confidence in the future, emphasizing strong commercial demand, a positive outlook for the global aviation market, and a projected 1-to-1 book-to-bill ratio in 2014.  However, the call also noted some uncertainties around defense budget issues and the need to achieve higher 787 delivery reliability. These factors may lead to a moderate, short-term stock fluctuation.
