Boeing's earnings call highlighted the successful resolution of the 787 battery issue, with FAA approval for a permanent fix.  Management expressed confidence in the 787's return to service, maintaining the full-year delivery forecast.  The call also showed continued strong demand for other commercial aircraft, while acknowledging near-term softness in the cargo market.  These factors suggest a positive impact on the stock price in the coming weeks, as the return to service should boost investor confidence.
