Boeing's earnings call highlighted strong commercial airplane demand and a record backlog.  Management affirmed the 787 program's profitability despite increased R&D spending, characterizing the increases as contingency planning for potential issues in the supply chain and assembly process. The call also addressed the company's defense systems, with a projected moderate defense budget outlook affecting their revenue guidance.  Overall, the news appears positive, but short-term stock price movements might be influenced by investor concerns surrounding the 787 R&D and overall defense sector outlook.
