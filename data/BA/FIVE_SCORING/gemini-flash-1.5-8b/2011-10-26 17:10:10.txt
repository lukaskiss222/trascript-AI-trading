Boeing's Q3 2011 earnings call highlighted strong order bookings, particularly for the 737 MAX, and a robust commercial backlog.  Management expressed confidence in the market despite macroeconomic uncertainties, emphasizing the resilience of passenger demand and the strong performance of existing programs.  Positive guidance updates and the successful transition of the 787 and 747-8 programs into production suggest a positive short-term outlook for the stock price.
