Based on my analysis of Boeing's Q1 2009 earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on the stock price. Here's my reasoning:

1. The company lowered guidance due to production rate cuts on wide-body aircraft (777) and lower price escalation forecasts, resulting in a $0.38 per share reduction in Q1 earnings.

2. Management acknowledged significant market uncertainties, with 60 aircraft deferrals already processed and more being negotiated, indicating continued pressure on their commercial business.

3. While defense business remains stable, there are uncertainties around future defense budgets and key programs like C-17.

The combination of reduced guidance, production cuts, and ongoing market uncertainties will likely pressure the stock in the near term, despite the company's strong long-term fundamentals and backlog.
