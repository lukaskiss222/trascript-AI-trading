Based on my analysis of this earnings call transcript, I predict a slightly negative short-term impact on Boeing's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

1. Lower than expected commercial airplane margins (9.1% vs expected ~11.5%) due to 787 program delays and cost absorption issues
2. Management acknowledged continued challenges with development programs and supplier negotiations
3. Growing concerns about airline customer health due to high fuel prices and potential need for increased financing support
4. While full-year guidance was maintained, achieving it requires significant margin improvement in second half which creates execution risk

However, some mitigating factors prevent this from being severely negative:
- Strong backlog ($346B) provides cushion against near-term challenges
- Reaffirmed full-year guidance
- Progress on 787 program toward first flight
- Management expressing confidence in productivity initiatives
