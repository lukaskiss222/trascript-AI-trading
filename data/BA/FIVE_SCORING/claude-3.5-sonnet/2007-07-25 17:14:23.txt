Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Boeing's stock:

Positive factors:
- Strong Q2 results with double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion
- Raised 2007 guidance for revenue, EPS, and cash flow
- Record commercial airplane backlog of $208B
- Commercial division operating margins increased to 11%

Negative factors:
- Increased R&D spending by $300M for 787 program
- Delayed first 787 flight test to end of September vs earlier August target
- Management acknowledging upward pressure on 2008 R&D spending
- Some schedule compression risks for 787 certification timeline

Overall, while the core business is performing exceptionally well with strong orders and profitability, the increased spending and schedule pressure on the critical 787 program will likely weigh on investor sentiment in the very near term. The market tends to react negatively to any hints of program delays or cost increases on major development projects.
