Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Boeing's likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Positive Points:
- Solid Q4 earnings with commercial margins at 11.1%
- Strong operating cash flow of $5.6B in 2009
- Progress on 787 with successful first flight and testing
- Defense backlog remains healthy at $65B
- Maintained production rates on key programs

Key Concerns:
- Conservative 2010 guidance with significantly lower margins
- Near-term cash flow guidance of zero for 2010
- Ongoing 787 and 747-8 development challenges
- Lower delivery forecast for 2010 (460-465 vs 481 in 2009)
- Additional R&D spending and inventory build up in 2010

While there are some positives, the conservative 2010 guidance and cash flow outlook will likely pressure the stock in the very near term as investors digest the lower expectations. The market tends to react negatively to reduced forward guidance even when current results are solid.

Rating: [-1]

The conservative outlook for 2010 and near-term cash burn will likely drive some selling pressure over the next 1-2 weeks, despite the company's longer-term potential remaining intact.
