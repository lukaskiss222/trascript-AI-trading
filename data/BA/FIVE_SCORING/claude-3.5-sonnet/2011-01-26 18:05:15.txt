Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on Boeing's stock price. While there are some positives like strong core program execution and growing commercial backlog, several concerning factors emerge:

1. Continued delays and challenges with the 787 program, pushing first delivery to Q3 2021 with additional rework needed on 20-25 aircraft.

2. Higher projected pension expenses and R&D costs impacting 2011 guidance.

3. Expected defense margin pressure due to a challenging contracting environment.

However, these negatives are partially offset by:
- Solid commercial order book with increasing production rates
- Strong cash flow generation from core programs
- Conservative management approach to guidance

The market has likely already priced in many of these challenges, but the continued 787 issues and lower 2011 guidance could create modest near-term pressure.
