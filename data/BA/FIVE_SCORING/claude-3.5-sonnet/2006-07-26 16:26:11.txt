Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, I project a positive short-term impact on Boeing's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong commercial airplane demand and record backlog ($220B total, $142B commercial), indicating robust future revenue streams
2. Raised guidance for 2007 revenue and earnings, particularly in the commercial segment
3. Healthy cash flow generation ($2.4B in Q2) and strong balance sheet position
4. Management proactively addressing execution challenges and increasing R&D investment to mitigate 787 program risks

While there were some concerns (AEW&C charge, Connexion review, increased R&D spend), these appear to be already known to the market and the overall business momentum, especially in commercial airplanes, should drive positive sentiment in the near term.
