Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact on Boeing's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

Positives:
- Strong core financial performance with record revenue, earnings, and cash flow
- Raised 2008 EPS guidance despite 787 delays
- Robust $327B backlog providing good visibility
- Limited exposure to US economic slowdown (only 11% of commercial backlog from US airlines)

Negatives:
- Ongoing 787 program delays and uncertainties around schedule
- Lowered 2008 cash flow guidance due to 787 issues
- Some pressure on commercial margins in 2008 despite productivity gains
- Economic uncertainty impacting US airlines

While the 787 delays are concerning, the market has largely priced this in already. The company's strong core performance, raised guidance, and massive backlog should help offset these near-term headwinds.
