Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of Boeing's short-term stock outlook:

Key Positive Points:
- Strong Q1 operational performance with revenue of $18.9B and core margins of 9.9%
- 787 battery fix approved by FAA; deliveries to resume in early May
- Maintaining full-year guidance despite 787 delays
- Healthy commercial backlog of $324B
- Strong cost reduction progress on 787 program (60% unit cost reduction)

Key Concerns:
- Near-term costs/disruption from 787 battery fix implementation
- Reduced 747 production rate due to cargo market weakness
- Uncertainty around potential defense budget cuts

Given Boeing's ability to maintain guidance despite the 787 issues, successful resolution of the battery problem, and strong underlying operational performance, I expect a positive short-term stock reaction as 787 deliveries resume and confidence rebuilds.
