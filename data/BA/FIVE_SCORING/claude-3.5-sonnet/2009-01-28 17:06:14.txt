Based on my analysis of Boeing's Q4 2008 earnings call, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on the stock price. While Boeing has a strong backlog ($352B) and diversified revenue streams, several concerning factors emerge:

1. Multiple headwinds including workforce reductions (10,000 positions), increased pension costs, reduced R&D spending, and expectations of more order deferrals/cancellations in 2009.

2. Continued challenges with key development programs (787 and 747-8), including a $685M charge on the 747-8 program and delayed deliveries.

3. Management's cautious tone regarding 2009 outlook, with reduced guidance and acknowledgment of significant market uncertainties.

While Boeing maintains strong long-term fundamentals, these near-term challenges and uncertainties are likely to pressure the stock over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the implications.
