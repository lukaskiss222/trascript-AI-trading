Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term (1-2 week) impact on Boeing's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong commercial performance with increased delivery guidance, healthy margins, and substantial order backlog indicating continued robust demand.

2. Management raised full-year earnings guidance and increased operating cash flow expectations, demonstrating confidence in near-term execution.

3. While there are some challenges (787 reliability, defense budget uncertainty), the overall tone was constructive with clear plans to address issues and continued investment in growth initiatives.

The combination of raised guidance, strong commercial momentum, and management's confident tone suggests the stock should react positively in the near-term, though likely not dramatically given some offsetting headwinds.
