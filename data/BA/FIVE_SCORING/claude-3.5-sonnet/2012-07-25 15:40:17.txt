Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Boeing's stock:

Positive factors:
- Strong Q2 operational performance with increased revenue (+21%) and earnings per share (+13%)
- Raised full year EPS guidance by $0.25 to $4.40-$4.60
- 787 production stabilizing at 3.5/month with plans to reach 5/month by year end
- Strong commercial backlog of $302B with healthy demand

Cautionary factors:
- Challenging second half with 787/747-8 delivery ramp-up still ahead
- Some pricing pressure on 737 program with MAX transition
- Defense budget uncertainty, though offset by international growth
- Conservative guidance suggests management sees execution risks

Overall, the raised guidance, strong commercial demand, and improving 787 execution should drive positive sentiment, though tempered by second half risks.
