Based on this earnings transcript, while Boeing showed strong core business performance with double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion, the significant delay and challenges with the 787 Dreamliner program create meaningful near-term headwinds. The key negatives include:

1. Major schedule push-out of 787 deliveries with only 3-4 deliveries expected in 2008 versus previous plans for 35+ deliveries
2. Increased R&D spending for 2008 due to 787 delays
3. Potential customer penalties and supply chain disruption costs
4. Reduced 2008 revenue guidance 

However, there are some offsetting positives:
- Record commercial backlog of $224B
- Strong ongoing commercial aircraft demand 
- Maintained 2008 EPS guidance despite 787 issues
- Solid defense business performance

While the market likely anticipated some 787 challenges, the scale of the delays and increased costs will likely pressure the stock in the near-term as investors digest the implications and wait for more clarity on the new schedule.
