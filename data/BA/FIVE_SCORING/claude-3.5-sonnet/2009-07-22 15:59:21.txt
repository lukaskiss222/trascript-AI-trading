Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a short-term negative impact on Boeing's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key concerns include:

1. Ongoing uncertainty around the 787 program fix and schedule delays, with management unable to provide clear timelines for first flight and deliveries
2. Admission that the program's profitability is under pressure from cumulative delays and potential customer penalties
3. Indications of defense revenue pressure in the mid-single digits due to budget constraints

While core operations are performing well and management expresses confidence in the 787's long-term prospects, the lack of clarity around the flagship program's schedule and financial implications is likely to weigh on investor sentiment in the near term.
