Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Boeing's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include strong commercial aircraft demand with record backlog ($296B), successful execution of planned production rate increases, and management's confident tone about financing availability and order pipeline for 2012. While there are some concerns around 787 deliveries and defense budget pressures, these appear largely priced in. The robust commercial outlook, strong cash flow guidance ($5B+), and momentum in key programs like the 737 MAX and 777 suggest upward momentum.
