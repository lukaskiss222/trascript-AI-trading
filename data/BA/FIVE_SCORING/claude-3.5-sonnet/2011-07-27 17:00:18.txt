Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of Boeing's short-term (1-2 weeks) stock price implications:

Key Positive Factors:
- Strong Q2 operational performance with double-digit margins in both commercial and defense segments
- Increased 2011 EPS guidance by 10% to $3.90-$4.10
- Major American Airlines order win (100 firm + 100 commitments) for re-engined 737
- Healthy commercial backlog of $262B and defense backlog of $61B

Key Negative Factors:
- Reduced combined 787/747-8 2011 delivery target to 25-30 aircraft
- 20-day production pause on 787 line to rebalance supply chain
- Uncertainty around future 737 re-engine production location
- Growing 787 inventory balance ($16.2B, up $1.7B in quarter)

Given the mixed signals but overall positive financial performance and major order win, I expect a modestly positive short-term impact on the stock price as investors digest the strategic pivot to re-engine the 737 and continued 787 ramp challenges.
