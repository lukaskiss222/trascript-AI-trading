Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess a positive short-term impact on Boeing's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key reasons:

1. Strong Q1 2022 financial performance with revenue up 4%, EPS up 43%, and operating margins at 11.3%, demonstrating solid execution across core businesses.

2. Record backlog of $346 billion (5x annual revenue) with strong international demand offsetting US economic concerns. Management expressed confidence in managing through any potential order cancellations.

3. While 787 delays present challenges, management provided a credible revised delivery schedule and maintained 2008 financial guidance while projecting 20% EPS growth in 2009.

The solid results and management's confident tone regarding future growth, despite known headwinds, should provide positive momentum for the stock in the near term.
