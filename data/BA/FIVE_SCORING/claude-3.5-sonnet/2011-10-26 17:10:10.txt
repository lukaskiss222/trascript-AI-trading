Based on the earnings call transcript, Boeing demonstrated mixed signals but overall positive momentum. Key positives include:

1. Strong commercial airplane backlog ($273B) with growing international demand
2. Successful 787 and 747-8 certifications and initial deliveries
3. Healthy production rate increases planned across product lines
4. Strong operating margins in both commercial and defense segments

However, some challenges exist:

1. Higher pension expenses expected in 2012
2. Some delays in 787/747-8 deliveries
3. Defense budget uncertainty
4. Cargo traffic softening

The management team exhibited confidence in their execution plans while acknowledging near-term hurdles. The strong backlog and production ramp-up plans suggest positive momentum over the next few weeks, despite some headwinds.
