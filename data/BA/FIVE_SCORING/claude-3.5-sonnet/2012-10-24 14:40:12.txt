Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess Boeing will likely see positive stock movement in the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. Strong Q3 results with revenue up 13% and earnings growth of 5%, demonstrating solid operational execution across both Commercial and Defense segments

2. Management raised full year guidance significantly, showing growing confidence in near-term outlook

3. Commercial backlog grew to $307B with strong order momentum continuing (925+ net new orders YTD)

4. 787 program showing steady production improvements and meeting key milestone targets toward higher rates

While there are some headwinds around pension expense for 2013, the core business fundamentals and near-term momentum appear quite positive, which should drive favorable stock reaction.
