Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Boeing's stock:

The quarter showed strong performance with several positive indicators:
- 12% revenue growth and 33% EPS growth
- Commercial airplane margins hit 10% (historically high level)
- Strong cash flow generation up 46% to $2.1B
- Record backlog of $213B with continued strong demand
- Confident outlook with potential positive guidance bias for 2006

However, there are some offsetting factors:
- Defense revenues declined for first time in years
- Some timing-related benefits in Q1 that may normalize
- No major catalysts mentioned for immediate term
- Stock already up significantly heading into earnings

Given the overall strong results, healthy outlook, and momentum in commercial aerospace, but balanced against an already strong stock performance, I expect a modestly positive short-term impact on the stock.
