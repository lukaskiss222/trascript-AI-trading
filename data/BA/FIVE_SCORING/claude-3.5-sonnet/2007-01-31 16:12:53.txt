Based on the earnings call transcript, Boeing demonstrated strong performance but faces some near-term challenges and opportunities. The key positives include record backlog ($250B), strong cash flow ($7.5B), raised 2007 EPS guidance, and continued robust commercial aircraft demand. However, there are some concerns around 787 supplier/production challenges, defense spending moderation, and execution risks in ramping up production rates. Management struck a confident but measured tone regarding their ability to manage these challenges. The diversity of revenue streams and massive backlog provide good visibility and stability going forward. Given the overall positive momentum and management's demonstrated execution capabilities, the stock is likely to see modest upward movement in the near term.
