Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly positive short-term impact on Boeing's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Despite increasing R&D costs for the 787 program, management maintained overall guidance and demonstrated strong underlying business performance, with commercial airplane deliveries and margins exceeding expectations.

2. The company provided transparent disclosure about 787 development challenges (weight and supplier issues) while emphasizing these are manageable and contingency plans are in place. The program remains within its business case parameters.

3. Commercial airplane demand remains robust with strong order backlog ($154B) and potential production rate increases, while defense programs are stabilizing after earlier challenges.

While there are some concerns around R&D spending and program execution, the overall tone was constructive with management showing proactive risk management and strong fundamental performance.
