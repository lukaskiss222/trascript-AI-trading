Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis for Boeing's short-term (1-2 week) stock outlook:

Main takeaways:
- Strong Q4 and full year 2013 results with record revenues, earnings, backlog ($441B), and commercial aircraft deliveries
- However, 2014 guidance was lower than expected on cash flow, deliveries, and earnings which disappointed investors
- Management cited headwinds from 787 production ramp-up costs, defense budget uncertainty, and timing of payments 
- Core business fundamentals remain solid with strong demand and order activity expected to continue in 2014
- 777X launch and IAM labor deal provide long-term stability but near-term costs will pressure margins

Given the disappointing 2014 guidance despite strong 2013 results, I expect the stock to face moderate selling pressure in the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the lower outlook and margin impacts. While long-term prospects remain positive, near-term sentiment will likely be negative.
