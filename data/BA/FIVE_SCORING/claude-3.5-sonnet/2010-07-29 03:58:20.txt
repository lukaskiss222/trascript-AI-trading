Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely 1-2 week impact on Boeing's stock:

Key Positive Factors:
- Strong commercial order momentum with higher than expected orders at Farnborough
- Solid core operating performance and margins in Commercial division
- Growing international defense opportunities with healthy margins
- No major technical issues found in 787/747-8 flight testing

Key Concerns:
- Both 787 and 747-8 delivery schedules could slip into early 2011 
- Reduced defense margins guidance due to contracting environment
- Supply chain constraints may limit production rate increases
- Defense business facing cost pressures requiring restructuring/layoffs

While there are some concerns, the overall tone was cautiously optimistic with solid core performance and growing commercial demand. The potential delivery delays were modest and largely anticipated. The international defense pipeline appears to be strengthening.

Conclusion: The balanced results and maintained full-year guidance should provide modest support to the stock in the near-term, though upside may be limited by program risks.
