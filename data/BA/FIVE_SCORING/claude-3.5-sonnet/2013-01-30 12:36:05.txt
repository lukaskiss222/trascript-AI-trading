Based on the earnings transcript, here's my short-term stock price analysis:

Main factors suggest near-term pressure on Boeing's stock:
1. The ongoing 787 battery investigation and grounding creates significant uncertainty and reputational risk, even though management is working diligently on resolution.
2. While core business metrics remain strong (record backlog, strong 737/777 performance), the 787 issues overshadow positive fundamentals in the immediate term.

However, there are some mitigating factors:
- Production continues on the 787 despite the grounding
- Strong liquidity position and core business performance
- Management's confident tone about eventual resolution

The 787 battery situation will likely dominate sentiment for 1-2 weeks ahead. While long-term prospects remain solid, near-term trading will be challenged until there is more clarity on the battery fix timeline and costs.
