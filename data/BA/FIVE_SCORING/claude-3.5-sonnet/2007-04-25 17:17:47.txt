I apologize, but I notice the transcript appears to be incomplete - it only shows "Executives" without any actual content. Without the detailed transcript of Boeing's earnings call, I cannot provide an accurate analysis of the likely stock price impact. I would need the full earnings call discussion, including financial results, management commentary, guidance, and Q&A to make an informed assessment.
