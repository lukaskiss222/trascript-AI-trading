Boeing's earnings call highlighted the FAA's approval of the 787 battery fix and the imminent resumption of deliveries, restoring confidence in the program. Despite the previous grounding, Boeing reported strong financial results, reaffirmed its 2013 guidance, and expects to deliver over 60 787s this year. The resolution of the 787 issues and the company's solid operational performance are likely to positively impact the stock in the short term.
