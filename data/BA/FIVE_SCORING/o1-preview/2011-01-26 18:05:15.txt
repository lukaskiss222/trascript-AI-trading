Boeing's earnings call highlighted ongoing delays in the 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 programs, leading to adjusted delivery schedules and increased R&D expenses. While the company reports a strong backlog and plans for production rate increases, these immediate challenges and potential impacts on cash flow may weigh negatively on investor sentiment in the short term. As a result, the stock is likely to experience downward pressure in the next couple of weeks.
