Boeing reported strong first-quarter results with increased revenue and reaffirmed full-year guidance, despite charges related to the KC-46 tanker and 747-8 programs. Management's positive tone, solid backlog, and confidence in future demand suggest investor sentiment will remain favorable. This indicates a likely positive short-term impact on the stock price.
