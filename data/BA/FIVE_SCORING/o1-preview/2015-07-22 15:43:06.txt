Boeing's Q2 earnings call reflects strong operational performance with record commercial airplane deliveries and solid cash flow. However, the $536 million after-tax charge related to the KC-46 Tanker program and the resultant reduction in EPS guidance may raise short-term investor concerns. While management remains confident in long-term prospects, the immediate negative impact of the charge could put slight downward pressure on the stock price in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
