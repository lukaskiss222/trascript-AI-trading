Boeing reported strong revenue growth and increased guidance for 2007, driven by robust performance in its Commercial Airplanes division and a record backlog. However, significant charges related to the AEW&C program and a global legal settlement have substantially reduced current EPS. Additionally, uncertainties around potential write-downs from the Connexion business may cause short-term investor concern. These factors are likely to exert negative pressure on the stock in the near term.
