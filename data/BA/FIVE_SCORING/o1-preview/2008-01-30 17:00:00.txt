Boeing's earnings call highlighted strong financial performance with record revenues, earnings, and cash flow for 2007, along with an increased earnings guidance for 2008. Despite delays in the 787 Dreamliner program, management expressed confidence in resolving issues and emphasized a record backlog and robust demand for their products. These positive factors suggest a likely positive short-term impact on the stock price.
