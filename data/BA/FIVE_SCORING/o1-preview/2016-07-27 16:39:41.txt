Boeing reported substantial charges on the 787, 747, and KC-46 programs, resulting in a quarterly loss and lowered EPS guidance for 2016. While revenue and cash flow guidance remain unchanged and underlying operations are solid, these significant charges may overshadow positive aspects in the short term. Investors are likely to focus on the unexpected costs, leading to a negative impact on the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
