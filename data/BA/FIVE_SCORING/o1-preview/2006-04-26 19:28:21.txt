Boeing reported strong first-quarter results, exceeding expectations with higher revenues, increased airplane deliveries, and expanded operating margins. The record backlog and strong demand for the 787 Dreamliner, along with management's positive tone and confirmation of guidance, indicate confidence in future growth. These factors are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
