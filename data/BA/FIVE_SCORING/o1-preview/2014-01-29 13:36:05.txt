While Boeing reported strong Q4 results with record revenues and earnings, its guidance for 2014 revenue, earnings, and cash flow came in below analyst expectations. Concerns about lower cash flow guidance and delivery rates, as well as apprehension about future cash flow peaks, may pressure the stock in the short term. Therefore, the stock is likely to face negative impact over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
