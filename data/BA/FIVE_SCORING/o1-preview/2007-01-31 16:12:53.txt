Boeing reported strong Q4 and full-year 2006 results, with double-digit revenue and earnings growth, and a record backlog of $250 billion. The company raised its EPS guidance for 2007 and forecasted significant additional growth for 2008, driven by increased airplane deliveries and positive progress on key programs like the 787 Dreamliner. These positive developments are likely to boost investor confidence and lead to a rally in the stock price in the short term.
