Boeing reported strong second-quarter results with increased revenue, higher operating margins, and raised earnings guidance for 2013. The company showcased robust demand for its commercial aircraft, including a record backlog and successful launch of the 787-10. Despite the recent 787 incident at Heathrow, management's confidence in the aircraft's safety and the positive outlook suggest short-term stock appreciation.
