Boeing reported strong second-quarter results, with revenue up 21% and an increased 2012 earnings guidance, reflecting robust operational performance and confidence in future growth. The company has a healthy backlog driven by strong demand for the 737 MAX, and its production rate increases remain on schedule. These positive developments are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.
