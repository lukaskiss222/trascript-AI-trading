### Analysis

Boeing's Q4 and full-year 2007 earnings call provided a mixed bag of news. The company reported strong financial performance, including record sales and earnings, driven by robust commercial airplane deliveries and stable revenues in its defense business. However, the delay in the 787 program and the potential impact on margins were notable concerns. Additionally, the company raised its EPS guidance for 2008, reflecting strong performance in its core businesses.

Key points to consider:
- **Financial Performance:** Record sales and earnings, driven by commercial airplane deliveries and stable defense revenues.
- **787 Program:** Delays and cost implications, but management remains confident in the program's potential.
- **Guidance:** Raised EPS guidance for 2008, reflecting strong performance in core businesses.
- **Supply Chain Issues:** Management is working to resolve supply chain issues and expects to complete the assessments necessary to define the flight test program and delivery schedule by the end of the first quarter.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on Boeing's stock price is likely to be mixed. While the company reported strong financial results and raised EPS guidance, the delays in the 787 program and supply chain issues could pose risks. However, management's confidence in the program's potential and the company's strong financial position suggest that the stock may rally in the near term. Given the mixed signals, the stock price is likely to experience some volatility in the coming weeks.
