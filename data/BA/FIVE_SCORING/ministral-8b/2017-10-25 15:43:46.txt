### Analysis

The Boeing Company's Q3 2017 earnings call revealed mixed signals. The company reported record commercial aircraft deliveries and solid operating performance, but the reduced R&D guidance and delays in military contracts signal short-term headwinds. Management's focus on non-defense market growth, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions in solar ceramics and manufacturing suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the reduced R&D guidance and delays in military contracts. The company's focus on cost-cutting and non-defense market growth may provide long-term support, but the near-term outlook is uncertain.
