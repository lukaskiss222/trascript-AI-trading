The company's focus on safety, quality, and integrity was emphasized, with a commitment to continuous improvement and earning back the trust of customers and the flying public.

**Conclusion:**

The uncertainty surrounding the return to service timeline, production rate adjustments, and the potential impact on customer trust and confidence could weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the company's guidance for the full year 2019 is expected to be revised once there is clarity on the return to service of the MAX fleet.
