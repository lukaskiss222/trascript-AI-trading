### Analysis

The Boeing Company's Q3 2012 earnings call revealed strong performance across both Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security segments. The company delivered 149 airplanes for the quarter, with notable achievements such as the first 787 assembled at Boeing South Carolina and the delivery of 787s to four new customers. The 787 program continues to show signs of improvement, with the transition to a production rate of 5 per month and final assembly expected by the end of 2012. Additionally, the company reported strong financial results, including a 13% increase in revenue to $20 billion and a 5% increase in earnings per share to $1.35.

### Short-Term Implications

1. **Positive Market Sentiment**: The strong performance and delivery milestones for the 787 program are likely to boost market sentiment and investor confidence in Boeing's ability to execute its plans.
2. **Pension Expense**: The company's pension expense is expected to increase significantly in 2013 due to changes in interest rates and market conditions. This could potentially weigh on the stock in the short term.
3. **Cash Deployment**: Boeing's focus on returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends is likely to be positive for the stock in the short term.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on Boeing's stock price is likely to be positive, driven by strong operational performance and delivery milestones. However, the increase in pension expense in 2013 could create some short-term uncertainty. Overall, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the next 1-2 weeks.
