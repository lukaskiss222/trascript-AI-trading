Based on the earnings transcript, Boeing's stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. The company's financial results were mixed, with revenue down 1% and core loss per share of $10.44. The IAM work stoppage and previously announced charges on certain commercial and defense programs also contributed to the financial strain. The company's balance sheet remains stable, but the debt balance is high, and the company is focused on managing its balance sheet to retain its investment-grade credit rating. The company's outlook for 2025 is negative, with free cash flow expected to be a use of cash. The company's long-term outlook is uncertain, and the company is focused on stabilizing its business, improving its execution discipline on new platforms, and building a new future for Boeing. The company's stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to these factors, but the company's long-term potential remains intact.
