Based on the transcript, Boeing's second-quarter earnings call revealed a strong performance across both Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security businesses. The company delivered 287 airplanes for the quarter, including 11 787s and 13 747-8s, and captured several new and follow-on awards. The 787 program continues to improve, with production rates increasing, and the 737 MAX is on track for firm configuration in 2013 and service in 2017. The Defense business generated strong operating results, delivering 35 aircraft and 1 satellite for a total of 65 aircraft and 4 satellites year-to-date. The company also captured several new and follow-on awards, including the F-15 Singapore performance-based logistic follow-on contract, Apache Block III low rate initial production for the U.S. Army, and the first international contract in its growing cyber security business. The KC-46 Tanker program successfully completed its Preliminary Design Review with the U.S. Air Force.

The company's financial results were also strong, with revenue up 21% from last year, driven by higher Commercial Airplane deliveries and Defense volume. Net earnings were $1.27 per share, up 13%, excluding pension expense, and operating margins of 7.7% and operating cash flow of $908 million. The company increased its earnings per share guidance for 2012 by $0.25 to be between $4.40 and $4.60 per share, and its revenue guidance for the year to be between $79.5 billion and $81.5 billion.

The company's stock is likely to rally in the short term due to the strong financial results and the company's confidence in its growth plans for the remainder of the year. The company's focus on disciplined execution, quality, and productivity improvements, as well as its commitment to innovation and continuous improvement, should continue to drive its stock price higher in the coming weeks.
