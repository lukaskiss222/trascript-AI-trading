### Analysis

The Boeing Company's earnings call for the first quarter of 2009 revealed several key points:

1. **Impact of Economic Downturn**: The company's commercial airplane market was significantly impacted by the global economic downturn, leading to production rate cuts and lower escalation forecasts. The 777 production rate was reduced from seven to five airplanes per month, and plans to increase production rates for the 747-8 and 767 were delayed.

2. **Defense Business**: The defense business maintained strong performance, with no significant issues reported. The company highlighted the importance of its large and diverse portfolio of defense programs and continued to focus on international defense opportunities.

3. **Financial Strength**: Despite the challenging environment, Boeing's financial strength remained solid. The company ended the quarter with $4.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. The A+ long-term credit rating was put on watch by S&P, but the short-term rating was confirmed, and Moody's reaffirmed the A2 long-term rating.

4. **Cash Flow Management**: Boeing emphasized its commitment to managing cash flow and reducing expenses. The company expects to generate $2.5 billion in operating cash flow in 2009, despite the challenging economic environment.

5. **Production Decisions**: The company's production decisions were not just a reaction to the current market conditions but were made deliberately after considering various factors, including customer contracts, significant cost elements, and major employment implications.

6. **R&D and Cost Pressures**: The company acknowledged the cost pressures associated with the 787 program but emphasized that the program remains a viable and economic proposition over time.

### Conclusion

The Boeing Company's Q1 2009 earnings call highlighted the significant impact of the global economic downturn on the commercial airplane market.
