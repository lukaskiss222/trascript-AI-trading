**Analysis:**

The Boeing Company's first quarter 2012 earnings call presented a mixed picture. The company reported strong financial results, with revenue up $19.4 billion and net earnings of $1.22 per share. However, the company's guidance for the year was revised downward due to higher period costs and the dilutive effect of 787 and 747 deliveries. The company also faced challenges in its defense business, with margins decreasing to 9% and a decline in volume associated with the Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. The company's outlook for the year remains balanced, with a focus on production ramp-up and profitability across all its Commercial Airplane programs. The company also announced plans to increase its production rate on the 787 and 747-8 programs and to continue its efforts to improve productivity and competitiveness throughout the business.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive, given the company's strong financial results and its focus on production ramp-up and profitability. However, the company's guidance for the year was revised downward, which could put downward pressure on the stock price in the coming weeks. Additionally, the company's challenges in its defense business and the potential for a merger between American Airlines and U.S. Airways could also impact the stock price. Overall, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to positive.
