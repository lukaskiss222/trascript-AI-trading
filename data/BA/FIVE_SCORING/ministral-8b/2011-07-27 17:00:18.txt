### Analysis

The Boeing Company's Q2 2011 earnings call revealed several key points that could have a short-term impact on the stock price. The company highlighted robust demand for both passenger and freight traffic, with strong fundamentals in the airline industry. The production rate for the 737 was increased to 42 airplanes per month starting in the first half of 2014, and the 787 is on track for first deliveries later in the third quarter. The 737 re-engining decision was a strategic move to meet market demands and maintain Boeing's market share. The company also mentioned that the 787-9 ramp plans are in place and the program is progressing well, despite some delays and pauses.

The earnings call also addressed the 737 re-engining decision, which was driven by a combination of technical and marketplace assessments. The decision to re-engine the 737 was made to deliver significant productivity to the airlines and maintain the company's market share. The company expects to capture a large part of the value in the pricing of the re-engined 737 and believes that the operating economics of the re-engined 737 will be similar to the current 737. The company also mentioned that the fan size for the re-engined 737 is still under study and will be finalized after the board approval.

The company's guidance for 2011 was increased by 10% to between $3.90 and $4.10 per share, reflecting the strong core performance across all businesses. The revenue guidance for the year remained unchanged at between $68 billion and $71 billion. The company expects Commercial Airplanes to deliver between 485 and 495 airplanes during the year, with a combined 20 to 30 787s and 747-8 deliveries weighted more towards 747-8. The company also mentioned that the 787-9 ramp plans are in place and the program is progressing well, despite some delays and pauses.

The company's stock price is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. However, the company's strategic growth and diversification efforts, as well as the strong fundamentals in the airline industry, suggest long-term potential for the stock price.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. However, the company's strategic growth and diversification efforts, as well as the strong fundamentals in the airline industry, suggest long-term potential for the stock price.
