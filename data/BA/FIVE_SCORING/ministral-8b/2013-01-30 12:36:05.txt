### Analysis

The Boeing Company's Q4 and full-year 2012 earnings call highlighted strong financial performance, significant backlog growth, and robust market share, particularly in the commercial aviation sector. The company reported record sales and deliveries, with notable achievements in production and program developments. However, the call was heavily focused on the ongoing investigation into the 787 battery incidents, which has had a significant impact on the company's operations and customer confidence. The management's cautious approach to discussing the investigation and the potential implications for production and engineering resources suggests a high level of uncertainty. The company's guidance for 2013 indicates a cautious outlook, with potential delays in deliveries and production rates for the 787. Additionally, the company's focus on cost-saving measures and supplier partnerships to drive efficiency and productivity indicates a strategic shift to maintain profitability in a challenging market environment.

### Conclusion

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the 787 battery incidents and the potential for further delays in deliveries. The stock may also face pressure from analysts and investors who are closely monitoring the company's ability to manage these challenges and maintain growth.
