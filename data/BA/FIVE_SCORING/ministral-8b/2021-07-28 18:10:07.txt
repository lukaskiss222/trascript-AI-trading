### Analysis

The Boeing Company's Q2 2021 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of news. The company reported strong financial performance, with revenue increasing to $17 billion and earnings improving significantly. The 737 MAX program made notable progress, with 47 deliveries in the quarter, and the 787 program saw improvements in stability and quality. The 777/777X program also showed progress, with the 777X expected to be delivered in late 2023.

However, there were concerns about the 787 program, with issues related to production rate and delivery cadence. The company also highlighted the importance of China for its future orders and deliveries, but acknowledged the challenges and uncertainties related to the regulatory approval process.

### Conclusion

However, there are risks related to the 787 program and the regulatory approval process in China, which could potentially impact the stock price in the near term.
