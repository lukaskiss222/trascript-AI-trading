### Analysis:

Boeing's Q2 2014 earnings call revealed a mix of positive and negative signals that could impact the stock price in the short term. The company reported strong revenue and operating margins, driven by robust commercial airplane deliveries and a favorable delivery mix. The tanker program, however, faced challenges with wire harnesses and potential software issues, leading to a $272 million charge. Despite these issues, management expressed confidence in the program's path forward and the long-term profitability of the tanker franchise. Additionally, the company's focus on productivity improvements and strategic expansions, such as the 777X and 787 programs, suggests long-term growth potential. The stock is likely to experience short-term volatility due to the tanker program issues and the uncertainty around the Ex-Im Bank financing.

### Conclusion:

The short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Boeing's stock price is likely to be negative, given the challenges faced with the tanker program and the uncertainty surrounding the Ex-Im Bank financing. The company's long-term growth potential, however, suggests that the stock could recover in the medium term.
