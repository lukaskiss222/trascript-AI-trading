### Analysis:

Boeing's first quarter 2022 earnings call highlighted several key points that will likely impact the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. The company reported a significant drop in revenue and operating losses, primarily due to the war in Ukraine, supply chain disruptions, and higher costs. However, management expressed confidence in the company's ability to stabilize its production system and improve delivery predictability. The call also addressed the 787 and 737 MAX programs, noting progress in certifications and deliveries, but also acknowledging challenges in meeting delivery targets and managing supply chain issues. The company remains focused on safety, quality, and long-term growth, but the immediate impact of the earnings report is likely to be negative due to the significant losses and challenges highlighted.

### Conclusion:

The stock price of Boeing is expected to experience a negative impact over the next 1-2 weeks due to the significant financial losses and challenges outlined in the earnings call. The company's guidance and management's tone suggest that while there are long-term growth prospects, the immediate outlook is challenging.
