**Analysis:**

The Boeing Company's Q4 and full-year 2013 earnings call reveals a strong financial performance, with record revenue and earnings, and a robust backlog. However, the company faces headwinds in 2014, including lower guidance for revenue and EPS, and uncertainty surrounding defense market conditions. Management's tone is optimistic, emphasizing the company's focus on cost savings, strategic expansions, and diversification efforts. The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is predicted to be negative, given the reduced guidance and uncertainties surrounding defense market conditions. The company's focus on cost savings and strategic expansions may help to mitigate these headwinds, but the immediate outlook remains challenging.
