**Analysis:**

Boeing's Q1 2024 earnings call highlighted significant challenges and improvements. The company reported a 8% revenue decrease due to lower 737 delivery volume, and a core loss per share of $1.13. Despite these numbers, the company is making substantial efforts to improve quality and production efficiency, which will likely lead to improved performance in the second half of the year. The company's commitment to eliminating traveled work and improving supply chain stability is a positive sign, but it may take time to see the full impact. Additionally, the company's focus on long-term development programs and strategic growth in services is encouraging. However, the stock may face short-term pressure due to the uncertainty surrounding the 737 production ramp and the ongoing negotiations with Spirit.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term outlook for Boeing's stock price is likely to be negative, given the challenges and uncertainty surrounding the company's 737 production ramp and the ongoing negotiations with Spirit. The company's long-term prospects remain strong, but investors may need to be patient as the company works through its current challenges. The stock rating is -1.
