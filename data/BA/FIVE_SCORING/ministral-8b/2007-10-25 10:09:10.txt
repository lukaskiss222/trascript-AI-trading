**Short-Term Impact on the Stock Price:**

The Boeing Company's Q3 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported strong financial performance, with revenue and earnings per share (EPS) both up significantly. However, the delay in the 787 program's schedule and the associated costs have raised concerns about the company's ability to meet its financial guidance for 2008. Additionally, the company's guidance for 2008 was adjusted downward due to the rescheduling of 787 deliveries from 2008 into 2009. This adjustment will likely have a negative impact on the stock price in the short term.
