### Analysis:
The earnings call for Boeing Company reveals a mixed picture. The company achieved record annual sales, but the delayed 787 deliveries and the increased R&D expenses due to the 787-9 development have led to a challenging financial environment. The company is expecting lower 2011 revenues and earnings per share, with a significant increase in pension expenses. However, the company is optimistic about the future, expecting a strong ramp-up in production rates and a return to profitability in the commercial aviation segment. The defense segment continues to perform well, with a strong backlog and a focus on international sales. The company also highlighted its commitment to innovation and the need to balance short-term gains with long-term innovation. Overall, the company is facing challenges but is well-positioned for future growth.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on Boeing's stock price is likely to be negative due to the delayed 787 deliveries and increased R&D expenses. However, the company's long-term growth prospects and strong production plans may lead to a rebound in the stock price over the next few weeks.
