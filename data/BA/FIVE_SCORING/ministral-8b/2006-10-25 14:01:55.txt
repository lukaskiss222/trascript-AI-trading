**Analysis:**

Boeing's earnings call revealed strong performance in the third quarter of 2006, with revenue and core earnings per share growing at double-digit rates. The company's commercial airplane business saw a 45% increase in revenue and a 9.7% expansion in operating margins, while the Integrated Defense Systems business generated $7.8 billion in revenues. The 787 Dreamliner program continued to make progress, with 432 firm orders and important development milestones achieved.

However, the company also faced challenges, including delays in military contracts and a reduced 2008 body armor forecast. The stock market was challenging, and there were concerns about the company's ability to maintain its growth trajectory. The company's management team addressed these issues and provided guidance for 2008, projecting $715M-$836M in sales and $4.55-$5.05 EPS.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Boeing's stock is likely to be negative due to the reduced 2008 guidance, delays in military contracts, and concerns about the company's ability to maintain its growth trajectory. The stock may face downward pressure in the next 1-2 weeks.
