The Boeing Company's Q4 and full-year 2009 earnings call revealed mixed signals. The company reported record revenue and strong operating cash flow, but the outlook for 2010 was tempered by lower commercial volumes and the continued challenges of the 787 program. The management's focus on productivity improvements and cost-cutting measures, along with the expectation of a rebound in operating cash flow in 2011, suggests that the company is well-positioned to navigate the current market conditions. However, the short-term uncertainty surrounding the 787 program and the ongoing defense market adjustments may create volatility in the stock price.
