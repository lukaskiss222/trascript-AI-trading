### Analysis

The Boeing Company's Q2 2008 earnings call highlighted several key points that could affect the stock price in the short term. The company's financial results were impacted by delays in the 787 program and other development programs, leading to a 14% decline in EPS. Despite these challenges, the company reaffirmed its guidance for 2008 and 2009, indicating a commitment to achieving its financial targets. The company also announced its intention to continue pursuing strategic growth opportunities, such as the acquisition of unmanned aircraft systems, and highlighted its strong backlog position. Additionally, the company's cash flow and liquidity remain strong, with a balance sheet and liquidity position that is well-positioned to weather the current economic volatility. Overall, the company's outlook remains strong, and the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

### Conclusion

The Boeing Company's stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the company's guidance and the uncertainty surrounding key defense contracts. However, the company's strong backlog position and commitment to achieving its financial targets suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to experience short-term volatility, but the company's strong fundamentals and strategic growth initiatives suggest long-term upside potential.
