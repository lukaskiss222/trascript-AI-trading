Boeing's Q4 and yearly transcript highlights the company's resilience in the face of challenges. The 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 programs' issues and a weak defense market impacted performance. However, strong cash flow, a record backlog, and progress in development programs are positive signs. Boeing's focus on cost cutting, efficient cash management, and strategic investments are encouraging. The stock will likely remain stable in the short term due to market uncertainties and development program risks, but Fundamentals indicate potential for medium-term growth.      [0]
