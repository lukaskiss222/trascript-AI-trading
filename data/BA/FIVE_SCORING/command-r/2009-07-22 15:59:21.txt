: 3M's Q4 and FY results call contained several mixed signals. While the company's Q4 revenue and earnings beat expectations, lowered guidance for FY2008 and delays in military contracts are short-term concerns. However, the company's diversification into civilian markets and international expansion are long-term positives. Boeing's Q2 results were impacted by delays and challenges in its 787 program, leading to downward pressure on cash flows and potential financial implications. The company's strong backlog and focus on operational efficiency are positive, but the uncertain economic environment adds risk. Both companies face challenges, with Boeing's issues being more immediate.  ]]><EOS_TOKEN><EOS_TOKEN><EOS_TOKEN>
