Boeing faces pressures on multiple fronts, including production cuts, and accounting losses on the 747 program. However, a strong backlog, aggressive cost management, and a diverse defense portfolio offer some resilience. The stock will likely face pressure in the short term due to market uncertainties and reduced guidance.
