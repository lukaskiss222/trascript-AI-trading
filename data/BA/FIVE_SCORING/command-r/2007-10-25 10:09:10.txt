Boeing’s recent earnings call revealed a mix of positive and negative factors for the stock in the short term. While the delayed 787 Dreamliner program dominates sentiments, Boeing’s robust backlog, increased 2007 guidance, and sturdy defense business present a more nuanced picture. The delay certainly impacts short-term revenues and causes approximately $3 billion in cash flow shifts from 2008 to 2009. However, robust commercial aviation demand and solid execution in other programs could offset some of these concerns. Recent management changes and increased oversight at the supplier level aim to mitigate further schedule creep on the 787 program. Overall, the current challenges appear priced into the stock, and with continued execution, the impact on the stock price should be neutral to mildly positive over the next two weeks.
