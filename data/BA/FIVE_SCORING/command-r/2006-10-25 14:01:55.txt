Boeing's Q3 earnings call reveals a strong performance in its commercial airline business, with high demand and increased production rates contributing to double-digit revenue growth. However, the focus of the analyst queries is on the 787 Dreamliner program's increased R&D spending, prompted by weight and supplier issues. Management emphasizes aggressive contingency planning, aiming to resolve these problems without compromising the delivery schedule. While the near-term focus on resolving these issues may cause some market concern, the long-term prospects for the 787 program remain strong due to its innovative design and strong market demand. The stock is likely to experience some volatility in the short term, but the increased R&D expenditure is seen as a prudent measure to ensure program success.
