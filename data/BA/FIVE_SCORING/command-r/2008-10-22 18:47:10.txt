Boeing's Q3 earnings call revealed significant challenges. The ongoing machinist union strike, supplier issues, and economic turmoil impacted results and future prospects. The strike's day-for-day impact on 787 schedules adds uncertainty. Boeing's strong backlog, diverse business, and financial stability are positive, but the current macro environment and strike's potential long-term effects are concerning. The stock will likely face pressure in the short term.
