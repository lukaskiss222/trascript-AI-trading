Boeing's Q3 earnings call reveals a company in rude health, with strong performance across the board. Impressive commercial airplane deliveries and backlog contrast with tempered defense revenue growth due to budgetary uncertainties. The 787 Dreamliner program accounts for much of the company's success, though dispatch reliability issues persist. Boeing's aggressive expansion plans, including increased production rates, bode well for the future, despite incurring higher costs in the short term. With strong cash flow, Boeing is well-positioned to return value to shareholders and invest in growth areas. The stock is likely to rally in the short term on these encouraging results.
