The Boeing Company's Q1 2008 earnings call revealed a strong financial performance, with revenue growth, strong cash flows, and operating margins over 11%. Despite the delayed 787 program and reduced 2008 guidance, the company's backlog continued to grow, reaching a record level of $346 billion. The management's tone was optimistic, highlighting the company's diversification efforts, cost-saving measures, and growth prospects. However, the 787 program delays and potential customer compensation may impact the company's financials in the short term.
