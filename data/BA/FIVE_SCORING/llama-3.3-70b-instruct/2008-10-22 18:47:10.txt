The Boeing Company's third-quarter earnings call revealed mixed signals, with the company achieving a record backlog but facing significant challenges due to the machinist union strike and supplier issues. The strike and galley shortages reduced earnings by an estimated $0.60 per share, and the company is suspending financial guidance until the strike concludes. Despite these challenges, Boeing's diverse backlog and strong balance sheet position it relatively well to weather the current volatility. However, the ongoing strike and potential impact on production rates and delivery schedules pose risks to the company's short-term outlook.
