The Boeing Company's Q4 and full-year earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with strong revenue growth and record earnings, but also delays in the 787 program and reduced guidance for 2008. Despite these challenges, management expressed confidence in the company's long-term prospects, citing a record backlog, strong global demand, and a solid balance sheet. The company's focus on productivity and cost-cutting measures is expected to drive margin expansion, and the 787 program, although delayed, is still seen as a key driver of future growth. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term, driven by the company's strong financial performance and long-term growth prospects.
