Boeing's Q1 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company facing significant challenges in the commercial airplane market due to the global economic downturn. Despite a strong backlog, Boeing reduced its 777 production rate and delayed plans to increase 747-8 and 767 production rates, citing lower demand and financing difficulties. However, the company's defense business performed well, with strong execution across its portfolio of programs. Management's guidance for 2009 was revised downward due to lower price escalation forecasts and production rate decisions, but the company remains confident in its long-term prospects. 

Overall, while Boeing faces short-term headwinds, its diversified portfolio, strong backlog, and focus on cost-cutting measures position it well for the long term. However, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
