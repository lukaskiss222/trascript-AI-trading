The Boeing Company's Q2 2008 earnings call revealed mixed signals, with the company achieving record sales and a strong backlog, but also facing challenges with development programs, such as the 787 and AW&C. Despite these challenges, management reaffirmed guidance for 2008 and 2009, citing a strong backlog position and ongoing productivity efforts. However, the company did experience a decline in commercial airplane margins due to delivery mix and timing of costs. Given the mixed signals, I predict a neutral short-term impact on the stock price.
