Boeing's Q3 earnings report and conference call revealed a mixed picture, with the company's commercial airplane division performing well, driven by high demand and production rate increases, but facing challenges with the 787 and 747-8 programs. The defense division also reported strong operating results, but the company is cautious about the impact of potential defense spending cuts. Guidance for 2011 was updated, with earnings per share expected to be between $4.30 and $4.40. The company's backlog remains strong, but the production ramp-up and delivery schedules for the 787 and 747-8 are being closely watched. Overall, the company's outlook is positive, but there are near-term uncertainties and challenges to be addressed.
