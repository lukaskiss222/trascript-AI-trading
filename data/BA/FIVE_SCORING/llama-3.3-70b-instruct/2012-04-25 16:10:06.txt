The Boeing Company's Q1 2012 earnings call revealed a strong performance in commercial airplanes, with a 9.9% operating margin, and a solid outlook for the year. The company's backlog remains strong, with over 4,000 airplanes valued at a record $308 billion. While there are some risks and uncertainties associated with the 787 program, management expressed confidence in meeting production targets and improving profitability. The company's defense business also showed resilience, with a 9% operating margin and a significant increase in international orders.

Given the overall positive tone of the call and the company's strong performance, I predict a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
