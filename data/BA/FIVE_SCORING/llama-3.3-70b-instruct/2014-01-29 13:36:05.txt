The Boeing Company's earnings transcript reveals a strong operating performance and strategic progress in 2013, with record revenue and earnings. The company's commercial airplanes business reported record revenue, and the defense business also had a strong year despite budget headwinds. Management's guidance for 2014 reflects solid core operating performance, but the market is reacting negatively to the lower-than-expected revenue and earnings guidance. The company's cash flow guidance is also lower than expected, driven by timing, cash taxes, and lower 767 deliveries. However, management is confident in its ability to execute on production rate increases, drive productivity, and return cash to shareholders. 

Given the mixed signals from the earnings call, I predict a neutral short-term impact on the stock price. The company's strong operating performance and record backlog are positives, but the lower-than-expected guidance and cash flow concerns are negatives. Overall, the stock is likely to trade sideways in the near term as investors weigh the pros and cons.
