The Boeing Company's Q3 2007 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company beating expectations on revenue and earnings per share, but facing challenges with its 787 Dreamliner program. The delay in the 787 program has led to a revised delivery schedule, with 35 planes being pushed from 2008 to 2009, resulting in lower revenue and cash flow guidance for 2008. However, the company's strong commercial airplane market, robust backlog, and cost-cutting measures are expected to help offset the impact of the delay. Given the revised guidance and the company's efforts to mitigate the effects of the delay, I predict a short-term negative impact on the stock price.
