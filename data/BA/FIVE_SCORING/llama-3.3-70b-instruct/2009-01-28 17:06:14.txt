The Boeing Company's Q4 and full-year earnings call revealed a mixed performance, with record annual revenue and a strong backlog, but also significant challenges, including delays in key development programs and the impact of the machinists' strike. Despite these challenges, management expressed confidence in the company's ability to navigate the current economic environment, citing its strong product portfolio, diverse backlog, and efforts to improve productivity and reduce costs. However, the company's guidance for 2009 was cautious, with a projected decline in commercial airplane deliveries and a significant increase in R&D expenses. Overall, the company's stock price is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key development programs.
