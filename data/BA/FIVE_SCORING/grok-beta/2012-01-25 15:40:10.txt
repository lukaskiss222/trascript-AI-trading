The Boeing Company reported a robust performance in 2011, highlighted by improvements in commercial aircraft deliveries, strong defense program wins, and a significant backlog, which suggests some stock upside potential for the next 1-2 weeks due to revenue and delivery growth outlook. However, the significant headwinds from increased pension expenses, modest margin growth in BCA despite production ramp-ups, and uncertainties around supply chain management for newer products like the 787 and 747-8 mean that any positive impact might be tempered. Additionally, while orders and commitments look promising, the impact will be gradual, more so for new models like the 737 MAX. Thus, the stock is likely to remain broadly positive.
