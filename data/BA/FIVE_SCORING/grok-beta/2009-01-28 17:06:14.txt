The Boeing Company's earnings call indicates several factors that will likely influence short-term stock performance. The company faced significant challenges in 2008, including a machinists' strike, development delays on key programs like the 747-8 and 787, and financial crisis impacts. While there is optimism about operational improvements in 2009, management acknowledges ongoing risks with supplier performance, financing concerns, and potential production cuts. Although steps are being taken to improve execution and manage costs, the short-term outlook suggests lingering operational and market uncertainties that could pressure the stock price.
