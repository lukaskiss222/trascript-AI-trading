The Boeing Company's Q1 2012 earnings release highlighted several key points that could have immediate repercussions on its stock over the next 1-2 weeks. On the positive side, Boeing reported strong commercial airplane delivery volumes, a solid order tally, and an increase in total company backlog, suggesting robust market demand. Management's confidence in ongoing programs and commitment to cost control initiatives provided a sense of stability. However, concerns arise from the relatively high costs of the 787 program, despite anticipated future learning curve improvements, and lower operating margins in the Network & Space Systems segment. The potential for lower backlog conversions in some areas and external uncertainties, like supplier performance and the impact of sequestration on the defense budget, add layers of risk. Given the balanced outlook with positives and negatives, I anticipate a slight positive impact on the stock price due to the solid commercial growth but tempered by defense sector concerns.
