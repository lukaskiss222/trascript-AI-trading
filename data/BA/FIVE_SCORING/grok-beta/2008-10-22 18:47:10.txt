The Boeing Company's earnings call highlighted several immediate concerns that could negatively impact the stock in the short-term. The ongoing machinist union strike, the potential need for significant cost reductions including employee layoffs, and the uncertainties around aircraft financing due to the volatile credit market are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the delays caused by supplier issues, particularly with galley shortages, and the increased costs associated with the 747-8 program further contribute to a negative outlook. While the company retains a strong backlog and has taken steps to manage its balance sheet, the immediate challenges could overshadow these positives in the short-term.
