Boeing's Q4 and full-year earnings call indicate a robust demand for both new commercial and defense aircraft with strong backlog and order growth in commercial, particularly for the 737 and 777. Defense also shows resilience despite margin pressures, with increasing international sales opportunities. However, delays in the 787 program deliveries and the financial impact of these delays, combined with increased pension and R&D expenses, are likely to negatively impact short-term stock performance, although the strong backlog and production increases could provide some positive cushion.
