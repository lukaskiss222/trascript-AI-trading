Boeing's Q2 2006 earnings call highlighted mixed results with strong commercial airplane sales but significant charges related to the AEW&C program and the global settlement affecting EPS. The company raised its revenue guidance for 2006 and 2007 due to higher commercial airplane revenues, although increased R&D investments were noted for risk mitigation on the 787 program. The stock might encounter short-term pressure from the reported charges, but the solid backlog, cost management, and robust commercial sales could foster a bullish sentiment, leading to a potential slight increase in stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
