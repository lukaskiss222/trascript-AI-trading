Boeingâ€™s Q2 earnings reveal a mix of challenges and reaffirmed guidance. The AW&C charge, 787 delivery delays, and increased cost absorption on other production programs led to margin compression in commercial airplanes. However, positive aspects include reaffirmed EPS guidance for 2008 and 2009, a strong backlog, stable demand, and ongoing productivity efforts that aim to counteract these headwinds. Given the slight miss in Q2 and the way management has outlined plans to regain productivity, the stock market might respond cautiously in the short term, but the strong EPS outlook could mitigate significant concern.
