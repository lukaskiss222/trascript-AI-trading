The earnings transcript indicates several factors that could negatively impact Boeing's stock price in the short term. The reclassification of 787 costs and the significant charge on the 747 program suggest ongoing challenges with major development programs, potentially diminishing investor confidence. Additionally, while Boeing maintains some stability with its 737 production rate and a solid 2010 order book, the increase in R&D spending and ongoing aircraft program issues could pressure margins and cash flow. These factors, coupled with market demand uncertainty, particularly concerning to the 777 and 737 programs, and the need to manage labor relations effectively, are likely to create a cautious investor outlook over the next 1-2 weeks.
