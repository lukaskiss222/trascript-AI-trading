The increased R&D spending for the 787 Dreamliner announced in this quarter's earnings reflects Boeing's commitment to maintain schedule and assist suppliers, alongside ongoing weight reduction efforts, portraying management's confidence in addressing short-term development challenges. Although higher R&D spending could typically hurt margins, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes (BCA) expects higher revenues and margins in 2007, suggesting operational strengths. This balance indicates a positive impact on BCA's stock in the near term, although the company will aim for a cautious approach to ensure long-term profitability and program success.
