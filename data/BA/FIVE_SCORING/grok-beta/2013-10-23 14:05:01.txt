Boeing's Q3 2013 earnings call underscored resilient product demand with a strong backlog and production rate increases for its 787 line, hinting at positive long-term prospects. However, short-term concerns were raised about potential disruptions from the recent government shutdown and defense budget uncertainties related to sequestration, alongside the burden of increasing deferred production costs, especially for the 787 program. This could pressure their cash flow in the near term. Despite this, guidance raises for core EPS and cash flow coupled with robust commercial deliveries are expected to provide some support, leading to a slight positive indication for the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
