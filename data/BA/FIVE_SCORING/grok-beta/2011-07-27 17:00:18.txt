The Boeing Company's second quarter results for 2011 showed strong operational performance with increased revenues and margins, and a significant order from American Airlines for re-engined 737 aircraft. However, they faced temporary production setbacks due to supply chain issues, including a 20-day pause for the 787, and uncertainties around tanker production which could slightly impact short-term investor confidence. On the positive side, the re-engined 737 announcement might bolster demand, but potential production scale-up uncertainties, combined with defense sector challenges, suggest a balanced short-term outlook.
