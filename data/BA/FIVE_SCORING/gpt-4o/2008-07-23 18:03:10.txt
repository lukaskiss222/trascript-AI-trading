Boeing's earnings call presented a mixed outlook. The company reported solid core business performance, and despite challenges with the 787 and AW&C programs, it reaffirmed its EPS guidance for 2008 and 2009, reflecting confidence in productivity improvements and a strong backlog. The defense segment showed resilience with ongoing demand, while commercial airplane demand, though challenged by oil prices, remained largely intact, supported by the geographic diversity of its backlog. However, short-term margin pressures and potential deferrals due to economic conditions could weigh slightly on the stock in the near term, although management seems proactive in addressing these issues.
