Boeing's third-quarter results indicate strong performance with double-digit revenue and EPS growth, driven by increased commercial airplane deliveries and a record backlog of $229 billion, showcasing robust demand, especially for the 787 Dreamliner. Despite challenges such as pressure on R&D expenses due to ongoing development programs, Boeing managed to raise its guidance for 2007. The decision to discontinue the Connexion service and the integration of Aviall are expected to positively impact EPS. The continued focus on productivity improvements, strategic acquisitions, and a strong defense portfolio suggest positive momentum. Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a modest positive impact in the short term.
