Boeing's Q1 2011 call reflects a robust order book, particularly for the 777 and 737 aircraft, alongside significant challenges with the 787 program's production and delivery timeline. While the commercial airplane backlog remains strong, and the defense segment shows healthy demand, the ongoing rework and delays with the 787 could pose a short-term negative pressure on cash flow and profitability. Management's focus on production rate increases and the strategic decision on potential new aircraft signal long-term confidence, but short-term stock impacts may be negative due to the 787 issues.
