Boeing's earnings call highlighted a strong financial performance in 2007, with significant growth in revenue, earnings, EPS, and cash flow. However, challenges with the 787 program, including a delay in the delivery schedule, raised concerns. The company's backlog and diversified customer base offer some insulation from U.S. economic volatility. While the positive guidance for 2008 and expectations for continued growth are reassuring, the 787 delays and related costs present near-term risks. Overall, while Boeing appears fundamentally strong, the 787 challenges may weigh on short-term stock performance.
