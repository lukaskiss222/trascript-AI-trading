Boeing's first quarter 2006 earnings call indicates a strong start to the year, driven by robust revenue and profit increases, and high demand for their commercial airplanes, notably the 787 Dreamliner. The company's record backlog of $213 billion and high percentage of sold-out delivery slots for future years suggest ongoing strong performance. However, Boeing acknowledges challenges with its supply chain and cost management, particularly in new programs like the 787, but these appear manageable. Given the current performance surpassing expectations and positive future outlook, Boeing's stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
