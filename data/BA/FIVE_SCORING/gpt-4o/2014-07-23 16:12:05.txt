Boeing's Q2 2014 earnings call presents a generally positive outlook based on strong operational performance, with a noted increase in guidance for full-year EPS due to strong core performance and tax benefits. Despite a significant charge related to the U.S. Air Force tanker program, the company's fundamentals remain robust, with high demand for its commercial airplanes, particularly the 737 and 787 models, and a substantial backlog. Additionally, the management's tone was confident regarding mitigating existing challenges in the tanker program and the company's ability to maintain production levels while capturing new business in defense. In the short term, while the tanker charge might raise some investor concerns, the increased EPS guidance and operational strength are likely to have a positive impact on Boeing's stock price.
