The Boeing Company’s earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2020 revealed several challenges and developments, with a focus on the 737 MAX resumption and continued production issues with the 787 and 777X. Despite a stable defense segment, Boeing is facing significant near-term pressures due to COVID-19's impact on air travel demand and additional financial burdens from production delays and engineering rework. The ongoing issues with widebody aircraft production—including the significant 777X charge and a cautious outlook on 787 delivery timelines—could lead to negative short-term sentiment among investors, potentially exerting downward pressure on the stock.
