Boeing's Q4 2021 earnings call highlighted challenges and progress in its recovery strategy. Management noted ongoing issues with the 787 program, including production delays and associated costs, which could temporarily affect cash flows. However, there is optimism about the 737 MAX's return to service in key markets like China, potentially boosting near-term deliveries. Encouraging signals include a positive cash flow in Q4 and robust demand in freighter and narrow-body markets. The net result is a cautiously optimistic outlook for Boeing despite ongoing challenges, suggesting a slight uptick in stock momentum over the short term.
