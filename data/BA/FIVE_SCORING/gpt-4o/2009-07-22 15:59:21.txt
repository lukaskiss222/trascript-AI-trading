Boeing's earnings call highlighted ongoing challenges related to the 787 program, notably delays and additional costs associated with technical fixes. Despite robust underlying performance in other divisions and a strong order backlog, the repeated delays and the complexity of executing the 787 program are putting pressure on the company’s profitability and cash flow. Although the management’s tone was cautiously optimistic about resolving the 787 issues and about their diverse portfolio, the market might react negatively to the uncertainty surrounding the program. Short-term stock performance could be adversely affected due to these operational headwinds.
