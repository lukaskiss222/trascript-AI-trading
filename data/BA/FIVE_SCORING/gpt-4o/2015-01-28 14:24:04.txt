Boeing's Q4 2014 earnings call highlighted strong performance, with record revenues driven by defense and commercial aircraft demand. However, concerns about deferred production costs for the 787 model remain, which might temper short-term investor enthusiasm. While management confirmed expectations for positive cash flow in 2015, market skepticism may linger around the high deferred costs and execution risks associated with upcoming production rate increases. These concerns could potentially suppress immediate positive momentum for Boeing's stock despite an operationally strong quarter.
