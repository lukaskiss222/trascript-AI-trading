Boeingâ€™s earnings call highlights a cautious optimism as the company works through multiple challenges. The resumption of 737 MAX deliveries and new orders indicate a rebound in demand, yet the 787 program faces production and regulatory hurdles that might weigh on short-term performance. While management expresses confidence in meeting future regulatory approvals and cash flow positivity in 2022, the current operational and supply chain uncertainties are likely to keep short-term investor sentiment subdued. This mixed outlook suggests a neutral impact on the stock price in the immediate future.
