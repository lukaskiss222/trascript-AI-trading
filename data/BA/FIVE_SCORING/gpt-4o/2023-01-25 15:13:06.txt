Boeing's earnings call reveals some positive developments, such as achieving positive free cash flow for the first time since 2018, strong demand with over 800 net orders led by the 737 MAX and 787, and promising international prospects. However, continued challenges in supply chain stability, ongoing abnormal costs, and uncertainties regarding delivery timings, especially with regard to China and broader macroeconomic factors, render the short-term outlook uncertain. While management maintains a confident tone and long-term guidance remains unchanged, the supply chain issues and the financial hits from abnormal costs are expected to weigh on the stock in the short term.
