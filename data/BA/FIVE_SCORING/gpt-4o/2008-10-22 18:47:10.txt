Boeing's third-quarter 2008 earnings call highlighted significant challenges, including a machinist union strike and supply chain issues affecting production and deliveries, notably impacting EPS. The company's substantial backlog and ongoing demand provide some cushion, but the strike's resolution timeline and broader market conditions introduce uncertainty. Management's ability to maintain production schedules and leverage financing options are key short-term variables. Consequently, the stock may face short-term pressure due to operational disruptions and economic volatility.
