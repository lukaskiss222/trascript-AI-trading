The Boeing Companyâ€™s earnings call indicated strong performance in 2012, with record commercial airplane deliveries and a robust backlog. The company faces short-term challenges due to the 787 battery incidents, which could affect deliveries and involve significant investigation efforts. While Boeing assures confidence in resolving these issues without hindering other projects, the uncertainty around the 787 could create short-term stock pressure. Continued strong demand and solid financial performance may mitigate some negative sentiment, leading to a mixed short-term outlook.
