The Boeing Company's earnings call indicates strong financial performance and a record backlog, with double-digit growth across several financial metrics. Despite the significant focus on the 787 program delays, the management has outlined a comprehensive plan to address these challenges, including changes in leadership and tightened supply chain management.
