Boeing's Q1 2013 earnings call provided a positive outlook amid resolution of the 787 battery issue. With the FAA's approval and retrofit progress, Boeing anticipates the return to delivery will bolster revenue, supported by a robust 4,400-airplane backlog. Management expressed confidence in maintaining high production rates and an anticipated surge in operating margins due to increased efficiency. Despite a cautious tone regarding U.S. defense budgets, the commercial segment's strength and strategic expansions suggest potential for short-term positive stock performance as investors gain confidence from operational stability and backlog conversion.
