The Boeing Company's third-quarter 2022 earnings call highlights several key points that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Challenging Financial Performance**: Boeing reported significant charges on fixed-price development programs, leading to a GAAP loss per share of ($5.49) and core loss per share of ($6.18). These charges, particularly in the Defense, Space & Security segment, are a major negative factor[3].

2. **Supply Chain and Labor Issues**: The company faces ongoing supply chain constraints, particularly with engine deliveries, and labor stability issues, which are expected to persist into 2023. These issues are limiting production rates and deliveries, especially for the 737 MAX[3].

3. **Positive Free Cash Flow**: Despite the challenges, Boeing generated positive free cash flow of $2.9 billion in the quarter, which is a positive indicator. However, the sustainability of this without one-time benefits like the tax refund is a concern[3].

4. **Demand and Backlog**: Strong demand across the portfolio, especially in commercial airplanes, and a robust backlog provide long-term optimism. However, near-term delivery constraints due to supply chain issues may dampen short-term enthusiasm[3].

5. **Management's Tone**: While management expressed confidence in the company's turnaround and long-term prospects, the immediate challenges and delays in key programs may weigh on investor sentiment in the short term.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on Boeing's stock price is likely to be negative due to the significant charges, ongoing supply chain and labor issues, and the overall challenging financial performance.
