The Boeing Company's first-quarter 2019 earnings call highlights several key points that will likely impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **737 MAX Grounding**: The grounding of the 737 MAX due to recent accidents has significantly impacted Boeing's financials, leading to lower deliveries, reduced revenue, and increased costs. The uncertainty around the return-to-service timeline and the associated financial impacts are major concerns[3Â».
2. **Financial Performance**: Despite higher defense and services volume, the company reported lower revenue and earnings per share compared to the previous year. The operating cash flow was also affected by the reduced 737 deliveries[1][3][4].
3. **Guidance**: Boeing has paused its share repurchase program and indicated that new 2019 financial guidance will be issued once there is clarity on the 737 MAX return-to-service timeline[1][3][4].
4. **Customer and Regulatory Confidence**: Rebuilding trust with customers and the flying public is a priority, with Boeing engaging in extensive efforts to ensure the safe return of the 737 MAX to service. This includes simulator sessions, training, and educational resources[3].
5. **Operational Adjustments**: The company has adjusted the 737 production rate and is managing supply chain and liquidity carefully to mitigate the impact of the grounding[3].

Given these factors, the short-term outlook for Boeing's stock is likely negative due to the ongoing uncertainties and financial impacts of the 737 MAX grounding. The lack of clear guidance on when the MAX will return to service and the associated costs and disruptions will continue to weigh on investor sentiment.
