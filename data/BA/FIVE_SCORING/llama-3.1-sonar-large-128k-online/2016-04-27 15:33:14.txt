The Boeing Company's Q1 2016 earnings call presents a mixed picture that could influence the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Boeing reported higher revenue, increased operating cash flow, and solid core earnings per share, which are positive indicators[3|.
2. **Challenges and Charges**: The company took a $0.24 charge related to the KC-46 tanker program, and there were additional charges for the 747 program. Despite these, the overall guidance for the year was reaffirmed, indicating confidence in overcoming these challenges[3|.
3. **Production and Delivery Targets**: Boeing remains on track with its production rate increases for the 737 and 787, and the company is confident in its ability to meet these targets despite historical trends in cancellations and deferrals[3|.
4. **Market Demand**: The commercial airplane marketplace is healthy, driven by passenger traffic growth and replacement demand. However, the cargo market is slower, which could impact some segments[3|.
5. **Productivity and Cost Initiatives**: The company is focused on driving productivity and cost reductions, aiming for mid-teens margins in the Commercial Airplane business over the next several years. This includes initiatives like Partnering for Success and Lean initiatives[3|.
6. **Services Growth**: Boeing is emphasizing growth in its services business, targeting a larger share of the $4 trillion market over the next 20 years. This is seen as a growing market rather than a zero-sum game[3|.

### Conclusion
Given the solid financial performance, reaffirmed guidance, and ongoing efforts to improve productivity and grow services, the short-term impact on Boeing's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. However, the presence of charges and ongoing challenges in certain programs might temper immediate enthusiasm.
