The Boeing Company's second quarter 2015 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Operating Performance**: Boeing reported strong revenue growth, driven by record commercial airplane deliveries, and generated significant cash flow of $3.3 billion. This indicates a solid core operating performance and a strong financial foundation[5%.
- **Backlog and Demand**: The company has a robust backlog, with over $431 billion in orders, and strong demand for its commercial and defense products. This backlog provides a long-term revenue stream and stability[5%.
- **Leadership Transition**: The transition from Jim McNerney to Dennis Muilenburg is expected to be seamless, with no significant changes in strategy, which maintains continuity and stability for investors[5%.

### Negative Factors:
- **Tanker Program Charges**: A significant charge of $536 million after-tax related to the KC-46 Tanker program due to issues with the integrated fuel system could impact short-term earnings and investor confidence[5%.
- **Program Execution Risks**: Despite the confidence in resolving the tanker program issues, the charge highlights the risks associated with development programs and the potential for future charges[5%.
- **Margin Impact**: The tanker charge and higher deliveries of 787 and 747 aircraft affected operating margins, which could be a short-term drag on profitability[5%).

### Overall Impact:
Given the strong operational performance, solid backlog, and continued demand, the short-term impact of the tanker program charge is likely to be mitigated. However, the charge and associated risks could lead to some short-term volatility.

**Prediction:**
The stock is likely to experience minimal to no significant impact in the short term due to the balanced mix of strong operational results and the one-time charge.

**Rating:**
