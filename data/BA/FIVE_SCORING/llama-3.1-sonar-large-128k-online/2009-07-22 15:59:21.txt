The Boeing Company's second-quarter 2009 earnings call reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **787 Program Delays and Financial Implications**: The delay in the 787 program due to a structural issue and the need for a fix is a significant concern. This delay is expected to put pressure on the program's profitability, and the financial impacts, including potential penalties, supplier costs, and R&D expenses, are still being assessed. This uncertainty could lead to short-term market caution[4%.

2. **Market and Economic Conditions**: The company is facing challenging market conditions, including airline deferrals, economic pressures, and budget constraints in the defense sector. These factors could continue to weigh on the stock[4%.

3. **Cash Flow and Financial Management**: Boeing is managing cash aggressively, considering additional bond offerings, and carefully managing expenditures. While the company has a solid financial foundation, the ongoing challenges with the 787 program and other development projects may affect cash flow and overall financial performance[4%.

4. **Guidance and Financial Performance**: The earnings guidance remains unchanged but will be reevaluated after the 787 schedule assessment. The company's ability to maintain or adjust this guidance will be closely watched by investors and could influence the stock price[4%.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the uncertainty surrounding the 787 program, ongoing market challenges, and the potential financial impacts of these issues.
