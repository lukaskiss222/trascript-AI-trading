The Boeing Company's Q3 2017 earnings call presents a strong and optimistic outlook, but the short-term stock price impact is likely to be neutral or slightly positive due to several factors:

1. **Solid Financial Performance**: Boeing reported record commercial aircraft deliveries, solid operating performance, and robust cash generation, which are positive indicators.
2. **Strong Backlog and Orders**: The company has a robust backlog of nearly 5,700 airplanes and received significant new orders, indicating continued demand and stability in their markets.
3. **Guidance and Outlook**: Boeing raised its full-year guidance for operating cash flow and earnings per share, reflecting confidence in their business performance.
4. **Challenges and Costs**: Despite the positive trends, the company faced additional cost growth on the KC-46 Tanker program and other development programs, which could temper immediate enthusiasm.

Given these balanced factors, the stock is likely to see a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact, as the strong performance and outlook are somewhat offset by the costs and challenges associated with certain programs.

**Rating: 1**
