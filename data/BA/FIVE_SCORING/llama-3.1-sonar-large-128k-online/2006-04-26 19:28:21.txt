- **Strong Financial Performance**: Boeing reported significant growth in revenues, net income, earnings per share, and cash flow, driven by increased commercial airplane deliveries and productivity improvements.
- **Record Backlog**: The company's total backlog reached a record $213 billion, largely driven by demand for commercial airplanes, particularly the 787 Dreamliner.
- **Optimistic Guidance**: Boeing confirmed its growth outlook and previous guidance for 2006 and 2007, with expectations of continued strong performance.
- **Commercial Airplanes Success**: The Commercial Airplanes segment saw a 48% increase in revenues and a 10% operating margin, with a high order intake and a sold-out delivery schedule for 2007.
- **Defense Segment Resilience**: Despite a moderating defense budget environment, the Integrated Defense Systems segment maintained strong profitability and margins.
- **Supply Chain and Production**: Boeing expressed confidence in managing supply chain risks and maintaining production rates, although this remains a watch item.
