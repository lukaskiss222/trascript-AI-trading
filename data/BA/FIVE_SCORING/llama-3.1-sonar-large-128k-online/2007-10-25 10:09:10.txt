The Boeing Company's third-quarter 2007 earnings call revealed several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Delays in 787 Program**: The delay in the 787 program, with 35 deliveries moved from 2008 to 2009, is a significant factor. This delay could lead to short-term disappointment and potentially impact investor confidence, despite the company's efforts to mitigate the effects through strong core business performance and productivity gains[5].

2. **Financial Guidance Adjustments**: Boeing raised its 2007 financial guidance but adjusted its 2008 guidance to reflect the 787 schedule changes. While EPS guidance for 2008 remains unchanged, the reduction in revenue and cash flow guidance for 2008 could be seen as negative in the short term[5].

3. **Strong Core Business Performance**: The company reported strong performance in its commercial and defense businesses, with double-digit top-line growth, sharp increases in operating margin, net income, and earnings per share. This could offset some of the negativity from the 787 delays[5].

4. **Cash Flow and Order Momentum**: Boeing experienced strong operating cash flow and order momentum, which is a positive indicator. However, the shift in cash flow from 2008 to 2009 due to the 787 delays might be viewed cautiously by investors[5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face some short-term pressure due to the delays and adjusted guidance, despite the overall strong core business performance.
