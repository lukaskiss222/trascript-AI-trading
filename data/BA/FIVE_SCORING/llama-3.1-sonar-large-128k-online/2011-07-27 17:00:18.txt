The Boeing Company's second-quarter 2011 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and cautionary notes that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- Boeing reported strong operational performance with double-digit margins in both Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security segments.
- The company announced increased production rates for the 737, with plans to reach 42 airplanes per month by the first half of 2014, which should meet high demand and support future growth.
- The backlog remains robust, with over $323 billion in total company backlog, providing a foundation for significant future growth.
- The re-engining decision for the 737, while less risky and costly than developing a new airplane, is expected to deliver significant operating efficiencies and maintain market share.

### Cautionary Notes:
- The 787 program continues to face challenges, including production pauses and delays, which could impact delivery timelines and investor confidence.
- There are concerns about the competitive pricing environment, particularly highlighted by the American Airlines deal, which may affect profitability margins.
- The company is managing various risks, including those associated with the 787 and 747-8 delivery schedules, supplier issues, and potential overruns on the tanker program.

### Short-Term Impact:
Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility. The positive operational results and strong backlog will likely be offset by concerns over the 787 production issues and competitive pricing pressures. However, the overall fundamentals of the company remain strong.

### Conclusion:
The stock might see a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term, driven by the company's solid operational performance and robust backlog, but tempered by the ongoing challenges in the 787 program and competitive pressures.
