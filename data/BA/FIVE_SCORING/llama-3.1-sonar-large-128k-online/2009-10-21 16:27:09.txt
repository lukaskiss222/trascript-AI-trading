The Boeing Company's third-quarter 2009 earnings call highlights several key points that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Significant Charges and Losses**: The company reported a net loss of $1.6 billion, primarily due to the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 charge. These one-time charges significantly impacted the quarterly results, which could lead to short-term investor caution[1].

2. **Challenges in Development Programs**: The ongoing issues with the 787 and 747-8 programs, including delays and increased costs, continue to be a concern. Despite progress, the complexity and overlapping of these programs pose management challenges that might worry investors[1].

3. **Market and Economic Pressures**: Boeing faces challenging market conditions, including reduced production rates for some aircraft models, deferrals, and cancellations. The company also anticipates continued top-line pressures on defense programs due to budget constraints[1].

4. **Guidance Adjustments**: The adjusted earnings guidance for 2009, now between $1.35 and $1.55 per share, is lower than previous estimates, which could disappoint investors and lead to short-term stock price pressure[1].

5. **Pension and Funding Concerns**: The pension expense is expected to be higher in the coming years, and the company is evaluating discretionary pension contributions, which could have a dilutive impact on existing shares and add to investor concerns[1].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the significant charges, ongoing development program challenges, market pressures, and adjusted guidance.
