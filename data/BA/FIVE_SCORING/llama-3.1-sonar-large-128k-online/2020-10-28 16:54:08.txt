The Boeing Company's third-quarter 2020 earnings call highlights several challenges and strategic actions that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

1. **Continued COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic has significantly affected Boeing's commercial airplane deliveries and services, leading to lower revenue and increased costs. This ongoing impact is expected to continue into 2021, which may keep investor sentiment cautious[5._

2. **737 MAX Issues**: The return to service of the 737 MAX is critical, but the process is complex, involving regulatory approvals, modifications, and reconfigurations. This uncertainty could keep investors wary in the short term[5._

3. **Financial Performance**: Boeing reported a GAAP loss and negative operating cash flow, which are major concerns for investors. The expectation that cash flow will not be positive until 2022 adds to the short-term pressure[2][5._

4. **Transformation and Cost-Cutting**: While Boeing is taking significant steps to transform its business, reduce costs, and improve efficiency, these efforts are long-term and may not immediately alleviate short-term financial pressures[5._

Given these factors, the short-term outlook for Boeing's stock is likely to be negative due to ongoing challenges related to COVID-19, 737 MAX issues, and financial performance.
