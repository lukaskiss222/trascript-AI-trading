Based on the transcript of Boeing's third-quarter 2011 earnings call, here are the key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Backlog and Order Book**: Boeing has a significant backlog of $273 billion, with strong demand for both single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft, which is a positive indicator for future revenue and production[6%.

2. **Production Rate Increases**: The company is planning to increase production rates for several aircraft models, including the 737, 777, and 787, which could lead to higher revenues and improved margins if executed successfully[6%.

3. **787 and 747-8 Deliveries**: Although there are slight delays and re-work issues with the 787 and 747-8 programs, the company is confident in its ability to manage these challenges and maintain a strong delivery schedule. The first deliveries of the 787 and 747-8 have been completed, which is a significant milestone[6%.

4. **Defense Segment Performance**: Boeing's Defense, Space & Security segment is performing well, with solid operating margins and significant contract wins. However, there are concerns about future U.S. defense spending due to fiscal constraints[6%.

5. **Financial Guidance**: The company has maintained its earnings per share guidance for 2011 and expects strong core performance across all businesses. However, there are some concerns about pension expenses and the impact of production delays on margins[6%.

6. **Macroeconomic and Market Risks**: The executives acknowledged potential risks from the global economic environment, including the European sovereign debt crisis and U.S. fiscal uncertainties, but expressed confidence in their ability to manage these risks and maintain production rate increases[6%.

Given these points:

- The strong backlog, ongoing production rate increases, and significant new deliveries are positive indicators.
- However, the re-work issues on the 787 and slight delays in deliveries might introduce some short-term volatility.
- The overall outlook remains positive, with the company expressing confidence in its ability to manage current challenges and maintain strong performance.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact due to the balanced mix of strong fundamentals and manageable short-term challenges.
