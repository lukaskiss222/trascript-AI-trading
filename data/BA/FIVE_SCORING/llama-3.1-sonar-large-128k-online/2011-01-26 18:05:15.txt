The Boeing Company's earnings transcript for 2010 reveals several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Challenges in 787 and 747-8 Programs**: The transcript highlights significant delays and challenges in the 787 and 747-8 development programs, including electrical incidents, rework on initial aircraft, and slippage in delivery schedules. These issues could continue to impact investor confidence and potentially delay revenue recognition.

2. **Production Ramp-Up and Inventory**: Despite the delays, Boeing plans to ramp up production rates, which could be challenging and may lead to increased costs and inventory levels in the short term. The company expects the 787 inventory to grow but at a lower rate as deliveries begin.

3. **Strong Backlog and Market Demand**: Boeing reported a strong backlog of over 3,400 airplanes valued at $256 billion, and there is continued demand for new airplanes driven by air traffic recovery. This could support the stock in the long term but may not immediately offset the near-term challenges.

4. **Financial Performance and Guidance**: The company reported solid core performance but with lower revenues and higher expenses due to development program delays. The 2011 guidance includes higher pension expenses and lower margins on initial 787 and 747-8 deliveries, which could impact short-term earnings.

Given these points, the stock might face short-term pressure due to the ongoing challenges in the 787 and 747-8 programs, despite the strong backlog and market demand. However, the company's overall strategy and long-term outlook remain positive.
