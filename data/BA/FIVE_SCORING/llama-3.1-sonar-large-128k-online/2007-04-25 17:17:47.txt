Based on the provided information from Boeing's Q3 2024 earnings call and other relevant sources, here are the key points that could impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

1. **Financial Performance**: Boeing reported a GAAP loss per share of ($9.97) and a core loss per share of ($10.44) for Q3 2024, primarily due to the IAM work stoppage and charges on commercial and defense programs. This negative financial performance is likely to exert downward pressure on the stock[2].

2. **Cash Flow and Debt**: The company reported operating cash flow of ($1.3 billion) and free cash flow of ($2.0 billion), which indicates significant cash outflows. Additionally, Boeing entered into a new $10 billion short-term credit facility, suggesting financial strain[2].

3. **Guidance and Outlook**: The management's emphasis on fundamentally changing the culture, stabilizing the business, and improving program execution suggests a long-term focus but does not provide immediate positive short-term outlook. The backlog of $511 billion is a positive sign, but current execution issues overshadow this in the short term[2].

4. **Operational Challenges**: Delays and issues with commercial widebody deliveries, as well as the impact of the IAM work stoppage, contribute to short-term operational challenges that could impact investor confidence[2].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience short-term negative pressure due to the reported losses, cash flow issues, and ongoing operational challenges.
