Based on the transcript of Boeing's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call, here are the key points that could impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

## Strong Operating Performance
Boeing reported strong third-quarter operating performance with 9% revenue growth, 10.2% core operating margins, and an 18% increase in core earnings per share. This robust performance could positively influence investor sentiment.

## Increased Guidance
The company raised its 2015 guidance for revenue, core EPS, and operating cash flow, which is generally a positive indicator for the stock.

## Solid Backlog and Market Demand
Boeing has a strong backlog, particularly in commercial airplanes, with over 5,700 aircraft in the backlog. The company also noted continued strong market demand, especially for the 737 MAX and 787, which supports long-term growth and stability.

## Challenges and Uncertainties
While the overall performance was strong, there are some challenges and uncertainties, such as the slow recovery of air cargo traffic, the impact of Ex-Im Bank reauthorization uncertainties, and the transition from the 777 to the 777X. However, these were not seen as immediate short-term risks.

## Cash Deployment and Share Buybacks
Boeing continued its commitment to returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which is typically viewed positively by investors.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call was positive, highlighting strong performance, solid market fundamentals, and a commitment to shareholder value. However, the absence of any groundbreaking or surprising positive news might limit the immediate upside.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive but not overwhelmingly strong impact in the short term due to the solid performance and increased guidance, but without any significant new catalysts.
