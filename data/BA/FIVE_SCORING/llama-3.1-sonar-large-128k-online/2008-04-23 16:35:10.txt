The Boeing Company's first-quarter 2008 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and challenging aspects, which will likely influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- Boeing reported solid revenue growth, strong cash flows, and operating margins over 11%, with earnings per share and net income growing about 40%[5].
- The company's backlog reached a record level of $346 billion, indicating strong demand and a diversified customer base[5].
- Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) performed well, with double-digit margins and significant contract wins[5].
- Boeing reaffirmed its 2008 earnings guidance and forecasted significant EPS growth for 2009, driven by higher airplane deliveries, productivity initiatives, and lower R&D and pension costs[5].

### Challenging Factors:
- The 787 program delays and associated costs could impact cash flow and profitability. Boeing has assumed a zero-margin for the 787 deliveries in 2009 to account for potential customer and supplier issues[5].
- The loss of the KCX tanker program to Northrop Grumman and Airbus (EADS) could have some impact, although Boeing is protesting the award[5].
- Economic uncertainties, particularly in the US, could affect airline orders and financing, though Boeing's international backlog and Ex-Im financing mitigate some of this risk[5].

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the strong financial performance, robust backlog, and positive guidance, the negative impacts of the 787 delays and tanker program loss are likely to be offset in the short term. However, these challenges might introduce some volatility.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong overall performance and financial outlook, despite the specific challenges mentioned.
