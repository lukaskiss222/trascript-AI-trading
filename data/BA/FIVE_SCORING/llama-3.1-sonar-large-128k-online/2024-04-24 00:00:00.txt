Boeing's Q1 2024 earnings call highlights several key points that are likely to impact the company's stock price in the short term:

1. **Reduced Production and Deliveries**: Boeing has deliberately slowed down 737 production to address quality and safety issues, leading to a 36% decline in commercial aircraft deliveries. This reduction, combined with the partial grounding of the 737-9, has resulted in an 8% drop in revenue and significant negative impacts on operating margins and free cash flow[3][4][5].

2. **Financial Performance**: The company reported a net loss of $355 million, though slightly improved from the previous year, and a core loss per share of $1.13. Free cash flow was a usage of $3.9 billion, which is higher than expected and largely due to lower commercial deliveries and unfavorable timing of receipts and expenditures[4].

3. **Quality and Safety Initiatives**: Boeing is taking extensive measures to improve quality and safety, including a 90-day plan with the FAA, engaging independent quality experts, and implementing new inspection protocols. These actions are expected to stabilize and improve performance but will take time[4].

4. **Supply Chain and Production Rate**: The company is working to resolve supply chain issues and aims to increase production rates, but this will be gradual. The goal to reach a production rate of 50 737s per month by 2025 or 2026 is contingent on successful quality improvements and supply chain stability[4].

5. **Cash and Liquidity**: Boeing's cash and marketable securities decreased to $7.5 billion, and the company is managing its liquidity carefully, with a focus on maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. There are discussions about potential supplemental funding to restore historical cash levels[4].

Given these factors, the short-term outlook for Boeing's stock is likely to be negative due to the immediate financial impacts of reduced production and deliveries, significant cash usage, and the ongoing challenges in improving quality and safety. However, the long-term prospects remain positive as the company works towards stabilizing and improving its operations.
