Based on the transcript of Boeing's second quarter 2016 earnings call, here are the key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Charges and Cost Reclassification**: The company reported significant charges related to the 787, 747, and KC-46 tanker programs, which impacted earnings but are seen as proactive steps to reduce future financial risk. This could lead to a short-term negative reaction due to the immediate impact on earnings[1].

2. **Solid Underlying Performance**: Despite the charges, Boeing reported strong underlying operating performance, solid cash flow, and a robust backlog. This indicates the company's core business is healthy, which could mitigate some of the negative impact from the charges[1].

3. **Guidance and Outlook**: Boeing maintained its revenue and cash flow guidance for 2016 but lowered its core EPS guidance due to the charges. The company remains confident in its long-term outlook and expects year-over-year cash growth, which is a positive sign for investors[1].

4. **Market and Industry Trends**: The wide body market is challenging, with Boeing facing some hesitation in near-term demand for the 777. However, the narrow body market and overall industry fundamentals remain positive, supporting long-term growth prospects[1].

Given these points, the immediate reaction to the earnings call might be mixed:

- The charges and lowered EPS guidance could lead to a short-term negative response.
- However, the strong underlying performance, maintained revenue and cash flow guidance, and positive long-term outlook could stabilize or even boost the stock in the short term.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility but may stabilize quickly as the market absorbs the charges as one-time events and focuses on the company's solid underlying performance and positive long-term outlook.
