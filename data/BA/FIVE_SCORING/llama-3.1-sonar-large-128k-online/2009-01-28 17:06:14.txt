The Boeing Company's fourth-quarter and full-year 2008 earnings call highlights several key points that will likely influence the stock price in the short term:

## Challenges and Impacts
- The company faced significant challenges in 2008, including a machinists' strike, delays in key development programs (787 and 747-8), and the impact of the global financial crisis. These factors led to reduced deliveries, lower revenues, and increased costs[4.).

## Guidance and Outlook
- Boeing provided 2009 EPS guidance of $5.05 to $5.35 per share and revenue guidance of $68 billion to $69 billion. The guidance includes provisions for operational and market uncertainties, such as potential production cuts and higher pension costs[4].

## Cost Management and Productivity
- The company is taking aggressive steps to manage costs, reduce discretionary spending, and improve productivity. This includes significant job cuts (approximately 10,000 positions) and streamlining organizational structures[4].

## Backlog and Order Deferrals
- Despite the challenges, Boeing's backlog remains strong at $352 billion. However, the company expects an increase in order deferrals and cancellations in 2009, although the size and diversity of the backlog provide some flexibility to manage these changes[4].

## Financing
- Boeing Capital is expected to provide about $1 billion in new financing in 2009, with most deliveries financed by external sources or cash payments from airlines[4].

## Development Programs
- The 787 and 747-8 programs continue to face delays and cost overruns, but the company believes these programs will deliver value in the long term. The 787 is on track for first flight in the second quarter of 2009, and the 747-8 remains a competitive airplane despite its challenges[4].

Given these points, here are the key implications for the stock price:

- **Short-term Pressure**: The ongoing challenges, including the strike impact, development program delays, and higher pension costs, will likely put short-term pressure on the stock.
- **Guidance and Outlook**: The cautious guidance for 2009 and the acknowledgment of operational and market uncertainties may temper investor expectations.
- **Cost Management**: The aggressive cost-cutting measures and productivity improvements could provide some stability and confidence in the company's ability to navigate the challenging environment.

However, the strong backlog, diversified business, and long-term potential of key development programs suggest that the company is well-positioned for the future.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance, ongoing challenges, and uncertainties around key development programs. However, the long-term fundamentals and proactive measures to improve execution and productivity could mitigate some of this pressure.
