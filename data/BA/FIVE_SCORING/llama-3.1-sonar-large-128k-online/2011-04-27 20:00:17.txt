Based on the transcript of Boeing's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Call, here are the key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

## Positive Indicators
- Boeing reported strong revenue and net earnings, with a net earnings per share of $0.78, up from $0.70 in the previous year.
- The company has a large and growing backlog, with $329 billion in total backlog, including $263 billion for Commercial Airplanes and $66 billion for Defense, Space & Security.
- There is robust demand for airplanes, particularly the 777, with 46 orders in the quarter, and strong interest in the 787 and 747-8 programs.
- Boeing is making progress on its development programs, with the 787 and 747-8 nearing certification and first deliveries expected in the third quarter and mid-year, respectively.

## Challenges and Risks
- The company is facing significant rework and production challenges with the 787 program, which could impact cash flow and profitability in the short term.
- There are ongoing issues with supplier deliveries and the condition of assembly for the 787, although improvements are noted.
- Boeing is managing through higher research and development expenses and pension costs, which could impact margins.
- The company is cautious about pricing pressures, though they do not anticipate significant price deterioration.

## Guidance and Outlook
- Boeing maintained its earnings per share guidance for the year between $3.80 and $4.00 and forecasted commercial deliveries between 485 and 500 airplanes.
- The company expects revenue, earnings, and cash flow to be weighted towards the second half of the year as deliveries of the 787 and 747-8 begin and R&D expenditures decrease.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong financial performance, robust demand for airplanes, and progress on development programs, despite the ongoing challenges with the 787 production.
