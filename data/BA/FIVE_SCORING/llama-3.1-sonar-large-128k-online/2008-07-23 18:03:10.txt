The Boeing Company's second-quarter 2008 earnings call presented a mixed picture with several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Challenges and Charges**: The company faced significant challenges, including a charge on the airborne early warning and control program and delays in the 787 program, which impacted financial results. However, despite these challenges, Boeing reaffirmed its EPS guidance for 2008 and 2009, indicating a level of confidence in managing through these issues[4].

2. **Strong Backlog and Customer Demand**: Boeing maintained a robust backlog, especially in commercial airplanes, with high demand for fuel-efficient aircraft. This backlog and diverse customer base are expected to help the company weather economic volatility[4].

3. **Productivity and Cost Management**: The management emphasized ongoing productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts, which are critical for offsetting the current cost pressures and achieving guidance. These initiatives suggest a proactive approach to managing financial performance[4].

4. **Financial Guidance**: The company reaffirmed its earnings per share guidance and provided a positive outlook for 2009, with expected earnings growth. This stability in guidance can be reassuring to investors[4].

5. **Economic and Customer Impact**: High oil prices and economic conditions were noted as potential risks, but Boeing's diversified backlog and global customer base were seen as mitigating factors. There was no significant impact on backlog from deferrals or cancellations at the time of the call[4].

Given these points, here are the implications for the stock price:

- The reaffirmation of guidance and the strong backlog position are positive signals.
- However, the immediate impact of the charges and delays might create short-term volatility.
- The company's proactive measures on productivity and cost management are encouraging for long-term performance.

### Conclusion
While there are short-term challenges, the overall tone and guidance suggest stability and confidence in future performance. Therefore, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive.
