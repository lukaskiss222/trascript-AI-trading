Based on the transcript of Boeing's third-quarter 2013 earnings call, here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Boeing reported double-digit revenue growth, healthy operating margins, and substantial operating cash flow. This indicates a robust financial position and strong execution of their business strategies[5].

2. **Increased Guidance**: The company increased its 2013 core earnings per share guidance to between $6.50 and $6.65, and operating cash flow guidance to greater than $8.5 billion. This positive revision in guidance is typically well-received by investors[5].

3. **Commercial Airplanes Performance**: Strong demand for Boeing's commercial airplanes, with a record backlog of $345 billion and plans to increase production rates, particularly for the 787 program, were highlighted. This suggests continued growth and profitability in the commercial segment[5].

4. **Defense Segment**: Despite uncertainties in the defense budget, Boeing's Defense, Space & Security segment reported solid performance, with a focus on productivity and cost reduction initiatives. International business represented 20% of the defense revenue, which is a positive trend[5].

5. **Productivity and Cost Initiatives**: The "Partnering for Success" initiative is showing early signs of success, with improvements in productivity and cost reductions across various programs. This initiative is expected to contribute to margin improvements over time[5].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, reflecting strong financial performance, increased guidance, and ongoing improvements in both commercial and defense segments.

### Conclusion

The strong financial results, increased guidance, and positive outlook on productivity and cost initiatives are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
