Based on the transcript of Boeing's 2013 Q2 earnings call, here are the key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Boeing reported strong revenue, higher operating margins, and significant operating cash flow for the second quarter. This positive financial performance is likely to be well-received by investors[4].

2. **Order Activity and Backlog**: The company saw robust order activity, increasing its commercial airplane backlog to a record $339 billion. This strong demand and large backlog are positive indicators for future revenue[4].

3. **Production and Delivery Targets**: Boeing is on track to increase 737 production to 42 per month and is making progress on the 787 program, aiming to reach a production rate of 10 per month by the end of the year. Meeting these production targets could boost investor confidence[4].

4. **Defense Segment**: Despite budget pressures, Boeing's Defense, Space & Security segment performed well, with a solid backlog and significant contract awards. The focus on affordability and international growth helps mitigate domestic market pressures[4].

5. **Market Share and Competition**: Boeing is confident about its market position, particularly in wide-body aircraft, and expects to maintain a competitive edge against Airbus. This confidence and the potential for increased market share could positively impact the stock[4].

6. **Challenges and Risks**: The company acknowledged challenges such as sequestration impacts and the need to manage costs and productivity. However, the overall tone suggests that Boeing is well-prepared to navigate these challenges[4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial performance, robust order activity, and confidence in meeting production targets.
