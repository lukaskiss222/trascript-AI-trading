Based on the Boeing earnings transcript, here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Transition and Production Rates**: Boeing is undergoing significant transitions, including the ramp-up of 737 MAX production and the reduction in 747 production rates. While these transitions may cause short-term disruptions, the company is confident in its long-term growth prospects and has a clear plan for managing these changes[6|.
- **Financial Performance and Guidance**: Boeing reported solid core operating performance, but there are near-term challenges, such as higher cash tax payments and the impact of the MAX transition on deliveries. However, the company remains confident in its ability to generate strong cash flow and meet its long-term guidance[6|.
- **Market and Customer Demand**: The company sees strong global passenger growth and a healthy commercial airplane marketplace, which supports their production rate increases and backlog. This demand is expected to continue, driven by passenger growth outpacing GDP, especially in regions like China[6|.
- **Challenges and Risks**: There are risks associated with the defense business environment, cargo market recovery, and the need to manage supply chain and production efficiency. However, Boeing is taking proactive steps to address these challenges, such as investing in productivity and affordability initiatives[6|.
- **Cash Flow and Capital Deployment**: Boeing has a strong cash position and is committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The company's capital deployment strategy reflects its confidence in its backlog and business outlook[6!.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on Boeing's stock price is likely to be positive but with some caution due to the ongoing transitions and near-term challenges.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is expected to see a positive impact in the short term, driven by Boeing's solid core operating performance, strong backlog, and confident long-term outlook. However, the immediate transitions and some near-term headwinds may temper the enthusiasm slightly.
