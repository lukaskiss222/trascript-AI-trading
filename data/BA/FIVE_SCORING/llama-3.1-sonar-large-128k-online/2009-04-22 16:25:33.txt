The Boeing Company's first-quarter 2009 earnings call highlights several key points that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Production Rate Cuts and Economic Impact**: Boeing reduced production rates for the 777 and delayed increases in 747-8 and 767 production, reflecting the global economic downturn. This decision, along with lower price escalation forecasts, reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.38, primarily due to a charge on the 747 program[4].

2. **Deferrals and Backlog**: The company reported 60 airplane deferrals from 2010 and 2011, with more deferrals being discussed. This indicates market softness and customer financial difficulties, which could continue to pressure the stock[4].

3. **787 Program Progress**: While the 787 program is on schedule for its first flight, it has faced cost pressures and weight issues. However, the large backlog and market acceptance provide some stability[4].

4. **Defense Budget Uncertainties**: The U.S. Defense Department's 2010 budget priorities present both challenges and opportunities for Boeing's defense business, introducing uncertainty that could affect investor sentiment[4].

5. **Financial Strength and Guidance**: Boeing's financial guidance was adjusted downward due to lower price escalation forecasts and the 747 program charge. However, the company maintains a strong cash position and solid backlog, which provides some stability[4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the reduced earnings guidance, production rate cuts, and economic uncertainties. However, the company's solid underlying business performance, strong backlog, and long-term outlook for its products and services suggest that the impact might not be severely negative.
