The Boeing Company's third-quarter 2008 earnings call highlighted several key factors that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

1. **Labor Strike**: The ongoing machinist union strike has significantly impacted Boeing's operations, reducing earnings per share by an estimated $0.60 and delaying deliveries. The strike's continuation and the subsequent ramp-up period will further affect production schedules and financial outlook.

2. **Financial and Market Turmoil**: The economic and credit market turmoil has increased pressures on aircraft financing, which could impact Boeing's delivery schedules and customer financing. However, Boeing has a diverse backlog and multiple financing sources, which mitigates some of this risk.

3. **Program Delays and Costs**: Delays in the 787 program and increasing costs associated with the 747-8 program are additional challenges. These delays and cost overruns could lead to further financial pressures and potential adjustments in investor expectations.

4. **Financing and Backlog**: Despite the challenges, Boeing maintains a strong backlog and diverse financing options. This includes support from Boeing Capital and various international and regional banks, which should help stabilize the company's financial position.

Given these factors, the immediate impact on Boeing's stock price is likely to be negative due to the strike, program delays, and financial market uncertainties. However, the company's strong backlog, financial strength, and diverse business portfolio provide some stability.
