Boeing reported strong revenue growth, raised its 2007 guidance, and showcased a robust backlog with record orders, indicating solid demand and management confidence. While increased R&D spending on the 787 program introduces some short-term cost pressures, the overall positive performance and outlook are likely to outweigh these concerns. The stock is expected to experience a positive impact in the short term.
