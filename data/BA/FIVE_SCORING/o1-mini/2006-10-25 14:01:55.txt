Boeing reported strong third-quarter results with significant revenue and EPS growth, backed by a record backlog and strategic acquisitions. Although there are increased R&D expenses related to the 787 program, management's confident tone and raised guidance for 2007 suggest that these challenges are being effectively managed. The overall positive financial performance is likely to boost investor confidence in the short term.
